579,110484,https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/415013-i-fled-anti-semitism-in-the-soviet-union-we-must-tackle-lax-gun-laws,I fled anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union: We must tackle lax gun laws as well as hate and bigotry,"I was born in the Soviet Union and eventually made it to America with my family to escape the persecution of Jews. It was hard to succeed, even to get by, for Soviet Jews. We faced limitations in education, employment, and life in general. My parents became targets of horrific anti-Semitism as they were coming of age, and I myself remember young children, no older than five or six, mocking me for being Jewish as we all lay in the children’s section of a Soviet hospital. (I ended up there after managing to tip an upright piano onto myself.) My family came to the United States because we believed it was a land of opportunity and equality for all, no matter their faith. That is why it has been so painful over the last few years to see mainstream political leaders give voice to familiar tropes about the “global elite” controlling our media, paying off advocates, and making secret deals to undermine American values. It’s so heartbreaking to see this hate result in the tragic mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue and the wave of hate crimes targeting Jews all across the country. ADVERTISEMENT We must work to eradicate hate and racism. We should call out all those whose rhetoric fuels the hate, including the President and his allies. And we should invest in treatment for those facing mental illness or crisis. Let’s redouble our efforts. No thinking person believes we don’t need to solve those problems. But until we do, our society simply cannot continue to allow virtually unfettered access to guns. It’s time to admit that our decades-long approach to gun safety – centered around the belief that we can keep guns away from dangerous people – is failing. Its failing because we’ve allowed the gun lobby to dictate the terms of the debate – a debate that is designed to perpetuate the status quo. Consider: Focusing on “dangerous people” deflects attention from the guns themselves. Every developed country has “dangerous people” – but the U.S. has a gun homicide rate 25 times higher than other countries because we have so many guns and we make it easy for anyone to have guns and use them. Reports suggest that the Pittsburgh shooter was a legal gun owner, and yet, surely a “dangerous person.” Keeping guns out of the “wrong hands” implies that guns in the “right hands” are a benefit to society. Dozens of studies affirm that where there are more guns, there is more gun death and injury, not less. Failing to go after the guns has led to calls for stricter enforcement and tougher penalties, an approach that has alienated communities of color who see more laws as a pathway to locking up more young black and brown men. Accepting that the constitution enshrines a right to keep and bear arms puts every effort to regulate guns in a defensive posture. Without acknowledging that the guns are the problem, the solutions that are currently being discussed are to be found at the margins: more background checks, taking guns away from people who already have them, banning bump stocks. There’s nothing wrong with these solutions, but they are inadequate to the scope of the problem. It’s time for a new approach. It’s folly to think we will see an Australia-style gun ban and nationwide buy-back of guns. The U.S. is not Australia, and we don’t need to be. Here are five things that we should do differently: Make it significantly harder to get a gun. Most Americans are shocked to learn that in most states there is no license required to own a gun, and guns can be acquired in person-to-person transactions with no paper record or screening. New research from Johns Hopkins University and the University of California, Davis finds simply requiring a background check for these private sales is not enough because of enforcement challenges. States that require all gun owners to obtain a license, which includes a rigorous background check, have reduced their rates of gun violence. Much like a driver’s license, gun owners should have training, pass a competency test, and renew that license periodically. As part of the licensing requirement, we should also: Conduct more vigorous screening of gun buyers. Research points to a history of violence, hate crime, domestic violence, anger control disorders, and alcohol abuse as risk factors for gun violence. Licensing bodies should thoroughly screen for these risk factors. Raise the minimum age for gun possession. Under federal law, there is no minimum age for possession of long guns. The minimum age for possession of a handgun is only 18. A minimum age of 21, with exceptions for military or law enforcement, would save lives. Stop paying allegiance to the Second Amendment. The Supreme Court’s 2008 Heller decision interpreting the Second Amendment as conferring an individual right to keep and bear arms is contrary to legal precedent and history, as multiple conservative legal scholars have argued. Embracing a constitutional right to guns is playing on the NRA’s turf. Advocates for campaign finance reform do not embrace the Citizens United decision; nor does the anti-choice community accept Roe v. Wade. We should stop it now. That said, we should also be pragmatic and recognize that the Roberts Court is unlikely to correct this legal travesty. So we must be crystal clear that the measures called for here are necessary for public safety and completely consistent with the Heller decision. Launch a nationwide campaign to educate Americans about the risks associated with guns. As a result of a 20-year misinformation campaign waged by the gun lobby, most Americans now believe that having a gun in the home makes it safer. Mountains of actual evidence says otherwise – which is exactly why the NRA has fought to prevent federal research on gun violence prevention. Americans need to know this so they can make informed decisions about whether to own guns. Ban weapons of war for civilian use, including assault-style weapons, high capacity magazines, as well as bump stocks and untraceable guns. Period. No exceptions. After election day, let’s hope that our leaders – inside and outside government – will consider a new approach to gun safety. But first, As someone who was born in a country where dissent was routinely suppressed, I understand the gift and responsibilities associated with living in a representative democracy. So lastly, I encourage you to vote. Vote like your life depends on it. Because it does.

Beierle, who killed himself on Friday after killing Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley and wounding five others at Hot Yoga Tallahassee, had filmed several virulently misogynist videos in 2014, according to David Mack, Amber Jamieson, and Julia Reinstein of BuzzFeed News. He had also uploaded sexist and violent songs to Soundcloud in the last few months. In the videos, Beierle rants about women who canceled dates or gave him their phone numbers even though they had boyfriends. He also mentions Elliot Rodger, the gunman who killed six people and wounded 13 in Isla Vista, California in 2014 — and who has become a hero to men who identify as “incels” (short for “involuntary celibate”). The Tallahassee shooting was the third crime in a single week that was apparently preceded by a trail of online hate. Robert Bowers, the man suspected of killing 11 people and wounding six others in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday, appears to have posted threatening language about Jewish people and HIAS National Refugee Shabbat, a refugee aid group formerly known as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, on Gab, a social network that has become a home for anti-Semitism and racism. Cesar Sayoc, the man arrested last Friday in connection with bombs mailed to CNN and several critics of President Donald Trump, appears to have threatened Democrats on Twitter and Facebook. “Hug your loved son,Niece,wife family real close everytime U walk out your home,” said one tweet sent to former Vice President Joe Biden, apparently by Sayoc. It included an image of Biden’s home with a target superimposed on it. The postings apparently made by Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were part of a pattern going back years. Elliot Rodger left behind a YouTube video in which he said women would be punished for not being attracted to him. And George Sodini, a gunman whose murder of three women at a gym outside Pittsburgh in 2009 appears to share similarities with the Tallahassee shooting, maintained a blog detailing his anger toward women for months before committing the crime. These men share more than their apparent online histories of bigotry. All were part of communities, online or off, that seemed to reinforce their views. That’s why online hatred and harassment is so serious. It’s not just that an individual person’s online posts can be warning signs of future violence. It’s also that hateful posts, even by those who never commit crimes, create an environment where those crimes are encouraged, accepted, and even celebrated. Many mass murderers and other criminals have left behind an online trail Beierle’s YouTube and SoundCloud history is rife with violent sexism. In one video, he says of a woman who canceled dates with him, “I could have ripped her head off,” according to BuzzFeed. In a song called “Locked in My Basement,” he describes holding a woman prisoner and raping her. He mentions Rodger in a video called “Plight of the Adolescent Male,” saying, “I’d like to send a message now to the adolescent males ... that are in the position, the situation, the disposition of Elliot Rodger, of not getting any, no love, no nothing. This endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration. That was me, certainly, as an adolescent.” Beierle had also been arrested in 2012 and 2016 for grabbing women’s buttocks without their consent, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. Meanwhile, posts apparently by Robert Bowers, the alleged Pittsburgh assailant, reveal a history of anti-Semitism, and a web of influences. On Gab, someone by the name of Robert Bowers posted a variety of anti-Semitic slurs and statements, including “jews are the children of satan,” according to the Associated Press. The same user criticized President Trump for being insufficiently anti-Jewish, and bragged about his gun collection, calling it his “glock family” and saying one gun in particular had an “amazing trigger.” As Vox’s Jane Coaston notes, Gab was started as a “free speech” alternative to Twitter, and allows forms of hate speech that are banned on more mainstream social networks. Because of this, it’s become a gathering place — and recruitment forum — for neo-Nazi groups. One post from a group called Atomwaffen Division features swastikas, racial slurs, and the invitation, “Join your local Nazis.” The synagogue shooting suspect also acted out of a specific kind of anti-Semitism, as Vox’s Dara Lind points out: “blaming Jews in America for bringing in an invasion of nonwhite immigrants who would slaughter the white race.” This particular kind of bigotry has been fueled by Trump’s claims that his political opponents are at fault for the caravan of migrants approaching the US, and by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists on Gab and other social networks, who have cast the caravan as a Jewish “invasion.” Most of the people posting this theory online have never committed anti-Semitic violence, but they helped create the conditions under which something like the Pittsburgh shooting could occur. Twitter and Facebook accounts connected to Sayoc contain threats against Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder, both of whom received pipe bombs. CNN analyst Phil Mudd also received a Twitter threat apparently from Sayoc. Political analyst Rochelle Ritchie reported a threat apparently from Sayoc to Twitter in the days before the shooting, but Twitter did not take action. Sayoc was apparently a devotee of a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which have spread on Twitter. As Vox’s German Lopez points out, he often posted criticisms of liberal billionaire George Soros, a common target of anti-Semitic fear-mongering on Twitter and elsewhere. Trump has fanned the flames of this fear-mongering, retweeting a claim earlier this year that Soros was a “nazi who turned in his fellow Jews.” Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were far from alone in leaving what appear to be online trails pointing to future violent behavior. “Tomorrow is the day of retribution,” Rodger said in his last YouTube video, according to the New York Times. “For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me.” “I do not know why you girls aren’t attracted to me,” he added. “But I will punish you all for it.” Rodger also identified as an “incel” and posted on forums populated by men with similar frustrations. The 22-year-old, who took his own life after killing others, became something of a hero to other “incels,” as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has noted. A man who killed 10 people by driving a van down a Toronto street in April identified himself on Facebook as part of the “Incel Rebellion.” Also on Facebook, he praised the Rodger, calling him the “Supreme Gentleman,” a nickname Rodger had chosen for himself. The man who shot and killed three women at a Pittsburgh gym, meanwhile, wrote on his personal website in 2008, “I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne – yet 30 million women rejected me – over an 18 or 25-year period.” “A man needs a woman for confidence,” he added. “He gets a boost on the job, career, with other men, and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a friend. This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded.” He also had ties to the pickup artist community, having purchased the book How to Date Young Women: For Men Over 35, and appearing in a video of one of author R. Don Steele’s lectures. Pickup artistry, more in vogue in the early 2000s than it is now, sometimes treated women as less human than men, as “targets” to be coerced or fooled into sex. It’s not murder, of course, but this was the climate of misogyny in which he planned his crime. Fighting hate crimes means understanding the communities that support them Each of these men may have seemed like a loner — but in fact, each was part of a group of people with similarly toxic views directed at Jewish people, women, or people of color. And we need to understand crimes like the Tallahassee and Pittsburgh shootings and the mailing of pipe bombs to Democrats within their larger context of on- and offline hate. That means holding platforms accountable for the behavior they allow. In the wake of the pipe bombings, Twitter has apologized for not taking Ritchie’s report more seriously. “We are investigating what happened and will continue to work to improve how we handle concerns raised by anyone on Twitter,” the account @TwitterSafety tweeted last week. But in response to a request for specifics from The Verge, the company merely pointed to blog posts from earlier in the year. “This is a familiar story from Twitter,” the Verge’s Andrew Liptak writes: “apologizing for reacting after the fact after it becomes clear that someone violated the site’s terms.” Gab, meanwhile, is being more defiant. “Gab.com is under attack,” read a message posted by the company on Monday. “We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh.” Investigating and prosecuting online threats can be tricky because perpetrators can conceal their identities and locations, and because when someone in one part of the country threatens someone in another, it’s not always clear which law enforcement agency should take the case. But there’s evidence that law enforcement, even at the federal level, isn’t doing all it can: The Department of Justice prosecutes only a small minority of cases of online threats and stalking, Joshua Eaton reported at ThinkProgress last year. A bill that would provide resources to help the FBI, DOJ, and local authorities fight such crimes, introduced by Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), has been stuck in committee since last July. While law enforcement can prosecute threats and stalking, other hate speech isn’t illegal. But that doesn’t mean companies like Twitter have to allow it on their platforms. As journalist Stacy-Marie Ishmael pointed out on Twitter, women, and especially black women, who experience disproportionate harassment online, have been warning of the seriousness of this harassment for years. Their warnings have mostly fallen on deaf ears. Taking online hate seriously would require platforms like Twitter to make fighting threats and bigotry a core part of their mission, not an afterthought. As Kate Klonick wrote at Vox in 2016, “Twitter needs to view fighting abuse as an essential feature.” It also means law enforcement, government, and ordinary users need to be aware of the ways in which online communities can fuel offline hate. Men like Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc have been posting about their violent intentions for years now, and getting support and affirmation for doing so.

The ad in question, from a super PAC started by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, hits Rep. Mike Coffman – who is locked in a tight re-election fight – for his ties to the National Rifle Association (NRA). The ad depicts text messages from a student to her mother, telling her the school is on lockdown because someone with a gun is inside. “I’m so scared. I love u. Tell Dad I love him,” the student, identified as Emily, texts in the ad before she stops responding to her mother. The ad then goes into Coffman’s support from the NRA. Emily Keyes was fatally shot in 2006 after a 53-year-old man took several female students hostage at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, and sexually assaulted them. She was 16 years old. Before her death, Keyes texted her family, “I love you guys” and “I love u guys, k?” FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS “Tomorrow is the 12th anniversary of losing Emily and to see that story politicized is disappointing,” Keyes' father, John-Michael, told KUSA-TV of the ad. He said it was “problematic” the messaging in the advertisement was similar to that of the I Love U Guys Foundation – a group started in Keyes’ honor that provides educational and training materials to schools or other entities. A spokesperson for the super PAC told KUSA the ad “was not modeled after any one individual’s story.” “Unfortunately there isn’t any name we could have used that wouldn’t be similar to a victim somewhere,” the spokesperson said. In a statement to the Denver Post, Giffords Executive Director Peter Ambler said, “We are amending the ad, removing a name all together and making clear that it is not connected to any one incident.” MARYLAND’S GOP GOVERNOR LOSES SUPPORT OF NRA AFTER SIGNING GUN LAWS The Giffords PAC said its goal is to “sweep out gun lobby politicians and bring in gun safety champions.” Of a possibility of a legal challenge to the ad, John-Michael said, “That’s not a battle we can afford, but it’s one that I think may need to be waged.” “I respect Gabby Giffords, but exploiting the name and horrible death of one of our own to try to win an election is beneath basic human dignity,” Coffman said in a tweet. “I can take the criticism, but this is gross. This ad should be pulled and someone should be fired.” Giffords has become a leading gun control advocate after she and 18 others were shot during a constituent meeting in 2011. Six people died during the assassination attempt. A spokesperson for Jason Crow, the Democrat challenging Coffman, said the Giffords PAC made the ""right"" decision. ""Going forward, Mike Coffman should be outraged whenever gun violence affects families, not just when it affects his re-election campaign,"" spokesman Mitch Schwartz said in a statement to Fox News.

186,100381,http://www.yahoo.com/news/latest-sunrise-remembrance-vegas-shooting-victims-131739895.html,The Latest: Vegas shooting survivors form human chain,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Latest on events marking the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured more than 850 (all times local): 10:40 p.m. Hundreds of survivors of the Las Vegas mass shooting have formed a human chain around the shuttered site of a country music festival where a gunman opened fire last year. Videos on social media Monday night showed the display of solidarity on the Las Vegas Strip started around 10 p.m. That's around the time the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting began. As people were linking arms and holding hands Monday night near the concert site, officials and several hundred others across town listened to bagpipes and the names of the 58 victims being read aloud. A procession of pickup trucks with American flags flying from their truck beds drove down the Strip around the same time honking their horns. ___ 10:10 p.m. Officials are reading the names of the 58 people who were killed in last year's mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip to mark the anniversary of the tragedy. The names were read Monday before survivors and family members of the victims shortly after 10:05 p.m., the time when the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting on the Las Vegas Strip began. Monday's ceremony at a downtown Las Vegas park where trees have been planted for every victim began with two minutes of bagpipes. Candles were also lit to commemorate those killed, and sobs could be heard in the crowd. Many in attendance are wearing T-shirts and other apparel with the Vegas Strong message that became a rallying cry for the city after the shooting. ___ 10:00 p.m. Casinos lining the famous Las Vegas Strip have dimmed their glittering lights to mark the first anniversary of a mass shooting at a concert that left 58 dead and hundreds wounded. The casino lights and famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign were darkened for three minutes starting at 10:01 p.m. Monday — around the time a gunman opened fire from the gold tower of Mandalay Bay hotel across the street from the country music festival. Story continues The shooting is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Strip's bright lights were last dimmed in October 2017, marking a week after the shooting. The casinos' marquees also went dark after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and to mark the deaths of famous Las Vegas entertainers like Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra, presidents like Ronald Reagan and local legends like former UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian. ___ 9:30 p.m. A popping noise similar to fireworks appeared to be causing distress for at least one attendee at a memorial garden in Las Vegas created in the wake of last year's mass shooting. The noise could be heard near the downtown Las Vegas memorial garden where officials, survivors of the shooting and family members of the 58 victims attended a dedication ceremony Monday night. The source of the noise wasn't immediately clear. A few people expressed anxiety about the crowd as people packed in to see the garden tribute. ___ 8:30 p.m. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Nevada elected officials are honoring those killed in last year's mass shooting at a country music festival by placing red and white roses on a tribute wall and dedicating a memorial garden. At least 200 people, including survivors and victims' family members, attended the Monday evening event. The quarter-acre downtown garden features a tree for each of the 58 victims and an oak that represents life. It is the only permanent public space that has been created to memorialize those killed when a gunman opened fired from a high-rise casino-resort suite on a crowd of 22,000. Jay Pleggenkuhle (PLAY-ghen-kool) helped created the garden days after the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting. He said Monday that it was the community's way of reacting ""with a very deliberate act of compassion"" to the violence. ___ 7:15 p.m. Gun violence survivor and former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords is among the officials marking the anniversary of a mass shooting in Las Vegas. Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, attended the dedication Monday night of a memorial garden that is the only permanent public space created as a tribute to the 58 people killed in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting at a country music festival. Giffords did not speak at the ceremony but Kelly did, calling Las Vegas a ""resilient and tough"" community. Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, was gravely wounded in a 2011 shooting at a constituent gathering in Tucson. She has since founded a gun safety organization and a political operation working to defeat incumbent Republican lawmakers it faults for stalled efforts to curb gun violence. Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller is one of the incumbents the group is working to defeat. ___ 6:30 p.m. A garden that is the only permanent public space created in memory of the Las Vegas mass shooting victims is being formally dedicated during a ceremony Monday night. Survivors, victims' family members, Gov. Brian Sandoval and others are gathering at the downtown Las Vegas space on the one-year anniversary of the tragedy. The garden created by volunteers in the week after the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting is packed with colorful flowers, photos, flags and other mementos placed in memory of the victims. The quarter-acre garden is home to 59 trees — one for each victim plus an oak that represents life — and a remembrance wall that has the names of all who were killed while attending an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. The garden is a few feet away from a bus stop and an adult store and miles from the shooting site. ___ 4:35 p.m. Las Vegas is phasing out the ""Vegas Strong"" slogan that became a rallying cry for the community after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. A year later, the phrase is being replaced with ""Vegas Stronger."" Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds were injured Oct. 1, 2017, when a gunman fired from the Mandalay Bay casino-resort into a crowd attending a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. Casino-resorts and the city's airport are among those who tweeted Monday the community has shown resiliency and bravery over the past year. A video included in some tweets shows the Las Vegas skyline and #VEGASSTRONGER. The Mandalay Bay's electronic billboard along the freeway is interchanging the ""Vegas Stronger"" message with ads for its spa and aquarium. ___ 3:15 p.m. On the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in the nation's modern history, the determined and the curious were turned away from the concert venue that became a killing field a year ago. Officials with MGM Resorts International handed out maps and fliers on Monday to pedestrians who reached a locked and screened gate at the unused Las Vegas Strip festival grounds. The company owns both the concert venue and the Mandalay Bay hotel, from which a gunman fired assault-style rifles from the 32nd floor, killing 58 people and injuring more than 850 on Oct. 1, 2017. The fliers suggested a short walk to a neighboring Catholic church for ""quiet reflection"" inside or to sign a commemorative banner — or a trip to a planned evening dedication at a downtown memorial garden. No parking was allowed along Las Vegas Boulevard and police closed a street between the church and the concert grounds, which has not been used since the shooting. ____ 1:55 p.m. Survivors and others marking the Las Vegas Strip mass shooting have held an evangelical vigil at City Hall to pray for the 58 people who were killed and more than 800 injured. Event organizer Pastor Troy Martinez declared that God was with the several dozen people praying and singing Monday beneath flags at half-staff on the steps of city government. A trio of friends from California — Jann Blake of Menifee, Linda Hazelwood of Anaheim and Michelle Hamel of Yorba Linda — held hands and bowed heads as several preachers considered the Oct. 1, 2017, carnage. Blake recalled strangers helping the three escape the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert venue without physical injuries. She said the ceremony wasn't about closure, but to remember the good that happened that night. ____ 12:40 p.m. Players from the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights plan to take part in several community events marking the anniversary of the Las Vegas Strip shooting. The team says they'll visit a blood drive at the Las Vegas Convention Center Monday and go to Community Ambulance in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson to honor 21 emergency responders who were at the festival when the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting began. Golden Knights players and team employees also plan to visit employees at the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor, and police and fire first-response dispatchers who fielded thousands of emergency calls. The Knights' inaugural season home opener last October came just days after the deadliest mass shooting in the nation's modern history. The team went on to stun the league with a run to the Stanley Cup Final. The team retired jersey No. 58 to honor shooting victims, and hoisted a banner with 58 stars to the rafters of T-Mobile Arena. ___ 10:15 a.m. President Donald Trump said rapid-fire devices like those used in the Las Vegas massacre a year ago will soon be ""ruled out."" Speaking in the Rose Garden on the anniversary of the attack that left 58 people dead, Trump said his administration is working through the process. He said, ""We are knocking out bump stocks. I've told the NRA. Bump stocks are gone."" Trump said the matter is working its way through regulations and public hearings. He spoke on the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Fifty-eight people died when a gunman fired from the Mandalay Bay casino-resort into an outdoor concert crowd on the Las Vegas Strip. He then killed himself. Many of the 23 assault-style rifles found by police were modified with bump stocks. ___ 10 a.m. Country music stations nationwide are planning a minute of silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in the nation's modern history. A country music trade group called Country Aircheck is encouraging radio stations and others connected with country music to pause on Monday for 58 seconds at 10:05 a.m. Pacific Time. That time will commemorate the number of people shot and killed Oct. 1, 2017, at an outdoor country music concert on the Las Vegas Strip. Country singer Jason Aldean was on stage when the shooting started. Country Aircheck is using hashtags #CountryStrong and #VegasStrong to promote the effort. It says the Nevada Association of Broadcasters, Academy of Country Music, ASCAP, Beasley Broadcast Group, CMT media company, Nashville Songwriters Association International and various entities in Nashville are among those planning to take part. ____ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is marking the one-year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history as he speaks at the White House on a revamped trade agreement with America's neighbors. Trump is sending his ""thoughts and prayers"" to victims of last year's Las Vegas shooting, which he called ""a horrible, horrible time in the life of our country."" Trump said Monday from the Rose Garden that, ""All of America is grieving for the lives lost and for the families they left behind."" He adds: ""We love you, we are with you. We're working with you very hard.'"" Fifty eight people were killed and hundreds injured when a gunman in a high-rise hotel rained gunfire into a crowd of 22,000 attending an open-air country music concert. ___ 7:35 a.m. The chief executive of MGM Resorts International is calling last year's mass shooting in Las Vegas ""an unforgettable act of terror."" Company chairman and CEO Jim Murren said in a statement Monday that the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 850 was a ""senseless act of evil."" MGM owns the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the gunman was when he opened fire into an outdoor concert crowd below on the Las Vegas Strip. Police and the FBI have not called the shooting a terrorist act or said the Mandalay Bay gunman was linked to a conspiracy. They say he acted alone. How the event is characterized is important for MGM Resorts because it wants to invoke a federal anti-terrorism law enacted after Sept. 11, 2001, in defense of negligence lawsuits alleging that the casino giant could have prevented the shooting. In his statement, Murren says that through unity and determination the Oct. 1 anniversary can become a day of healing and hope. ___ 7:15 a.m. A somber sunrise remembrance ceremony is underway in Las Vegas at an event that begins a day of memorials on the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Several hundred people including survivors, families of victims, first-responders and elected officials gathered at an outdoor amphitheater in Las Vegas Monday to hear Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval speak about the 58 people who were killed on Oct. 1, 2017. He said: ""Today we remember the unforgettable. Today, we comfort the inconsolable."" Sandoval added: ""Today, we are reminded of the pain that never really goes away."" Prayers, songs, speeches and the release of 58 doves as Las Vegas were planned for the a day of memorials and other events. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo is also scheduled to speak at the daybreak event. ____ 6:10 a.m. Sunrise is brightening the horizon over Las Vegas, where survivors, victims' family members, first-responders and elected officials are gathering to mark the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo are among speakers at a daybreak memorial featuring the release of a flock of doves to honor the 58 people who were killed on Oct. 1, 2017. Music from the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts high school Academy Singers and 58 seconds of silence are scheduled during the remembrance at the Clark County Government Center amphitheater. The government center also is hosting the Las Vegas Portraits Project. It features artists' renderings of the people killed at a Route 91 Harvest Festival country music concert. That display continues through Oct. 19, when the works will be presented to victims' loved ones. Las Vegas city officials plan to host a prayer vigil beginning at 11:30 a.m. in the plaza in front of City Hall. ____ 1:15 a.m. It's been a year since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, and a scheduled speaker at a sunrise ceremony in Las Vegas is calling it a tragedy of grand scale. Mynda Smith's sister was one of 58 people killed when a gunman in a high-rise hotel rained gunfire into a crowd of 22,000 attending an open-air country music concert. Smith started a scholarship fund for victims' children and says she reached loved ones of almost all the dead. She says that for some, it may be too soon for hearts to be healed. Survivors, victims' family members, first-responders and elected officials will offer prayers, songs, speeches and the release of 58 doves as Las Vegas begins a day of memorials and other events. ____ Find complete AP coverage of the Las Vegas mass shooting here: https://apnews.com/tag/LasVegasmassshooting",2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting Las Vegas Andrea Castilla Man Shooting Mass shooting   2017,"A woman and her son, Adam, who was killed in the shooting at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on Monday.","LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Latest on events marking the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured more than 850 (all times local): 10:40 p.m.","the las vegas strip began around 10:40 p.m. monday night to mark the anniversary of the oct. 1, 2017,000 mass shooting in las vegas. hundreds of survivors of the shooting have formed a human chain around the shuttered site of a country music festival where a gunman opened fire last year. on monday, the victims were read aloud at a procession of pickup trucks with american flags flying from their truck beds drove down the strip around the same time honking their horns",1,2,7,99,3,0,1,99.0,0,99
1051,382,http://us.cnn.com/2018/08/15/health/school-design-era-mass-shootings-trnd/index.html,How to design a school in the era of mass shootings,"(CNN) For school designers and architects, the current debate about how to make schools safer focuses too much on add-on measures. Metal detectors? More resource officers? Armed teachers? Bulletproof backpacks? These security steps, whether effective or not, don't address the fundamental way that a school works or how people move through it. They also must be balanced with the need to create an environment where kids feel inspired and energized to learn. As students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and across the country return to classes this week, CNN spoke to designers, architects and security experts to answer a sobering question: How do you design a school in the age of the mass shooting? Their answers, which follow a theory known as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, illuminate the delicate balance between security and education. ""It should be inspiring space. It should be lit with daylight. It should be a place where everyone feels welcome,"" said Sue Pruchnicki, principal at Bond Architects, a St. Louis firm that has designed many new schools. ""Our task is to make it safer without making it look like a fortress."" Perimeter landscaping that makes visitors visible The entrance to this middle school, designed by PBK/IN2 Architecture, includes large glass windows, protective poles and an entrance clearly outlined in red. One main idea of designing safety is to create several layers of security, or concentric rings of access, starting with the perimeter and then working inward into the school. If there is an intruder, each layer of security is designed to delay him or her until first responders can arrive. The outermost layer of security is the landscape leading up to the entrance. Designers said they try to create a perimeter where everyone has to walk up on foot, so that people inside the school can easily see who is coming. ""Folks have to come up on a pedestrian level,"" said Art Bond, principal of Bond Architects. In practice, that means the area around the entrance might have a pathway through a low shrubbery or a garden, so that there are no places to hide. Some schools might have a pedestrian bridge out front to funnel visitors to that main entrance. In addition, visitor parking lots and bus dropoffs are located in separate areas further from the school entrance, so visitors have to walk to the entrance. Bollards or strategically placed planters near the entrance can also be used to prevent someone driving into the building. ""We want to make sure that we have lots of windows so that administrators, people that are in charge, can see folks approaching the building,"" said Bill Payne, CEO of architecture and design firm Fanning Howey. A single entrance point At an elementary school in Zanesville, Ohio, visitors enter an enclosed vestibule connected to the front office when they walk into the school. After the shooting at Santa Fe High School in May, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick blamed the shooting on ""too many entrances and too many exits"" at the school. The comment was mocked by some as "" door control ,"" but he was making a real point: Many new schools are now built with a single, primary entrance that all students, teachers and visitors must come through. ""In design, what we want to make sure is that we can visually observe anybody that approaches the building and then pass them through a filtering process,"" Payne explained. The idea is to have a better way to control who visits the schools and, in the case of an emergency, to create an additional barrier to anyone seeking to do harm. Architects are designing schools where visitors encounter a single entrance point in a vestibule or antechamber. The visitors then must talk to an administrator or secretary to present their ID and reason for being there, and only then are they allowed to pass through another set of doors to get into the school. For example, the firm Fanning Howey built the West Muskingum Learning Center in Zanesville, Ohio with a vestibule that leads visitors to a front office. Ken Trump, the president of National School Safety and Security Services, said the vestibules help with what's called ""visitor management."" ""You reconfigure the front entrance way of the school, so instead of being able to just walk right in to the school, you get funneled to the office to get checked in,"" he said. These vestibule doors are generally left open during the morning and afternoon rush and then closed once classes begin. There are also many one-way exits around the school that can be opened in case of a fire or other emergency. ""One way in, multiple ways out,"" Payne said. Reinforced doors Visitors to an elementary school in St. Louis County must first enter a secure vestibule with a bankteller-like glass window. This vestibule, renovated in 2017, has glass that is protected by security glazing. During the Sandy Hook shooting, the gunman used an assault weapon to shoot through the vestibule glass and enter the building. With that in mind, some schools are strengthening the glass and reinforcing the doors of their entrances to make the school a ""harder"" target for any intruder. That has become a robust market for some businesses. Total Security Solutions is a company that designs, plans and produces bullet resistant barriers for schools -- but in a way that keeps the doors from looking too intimidating. ""We try to do that in a way that blends into the architecture, something that's visually pleasing, that doesn't look like Fort Knox or prison,"" said Rick Reid, market segment leader with Total Security Solutions. Reinforcing every single door in the school isn't tenable or cost effective, he said. Total Security Solutions mainly works to reinforce the vestibule at the single entrance point of the school. Other designers add a security film to the glass in the vestibule entrance with the idea of slowing down an intruder. The security film, although not bulletproof, keeps the glass in its frame like a car windshield, so intruders can't simply shatter the glass and walk right into the school. ""It's gonna take them longer to (enter), and by then, hopefully someone notices and somebody puts the building in lockdown so that police can be on their way,"" said Irene Nigaglioni, president of IN2 Architecture. The vestibules and hardened doors can also host metal detectors. However, their use remains a fraught issue among designers and security experts who say metal detectors may not be helpful in stopping an intruder and create unintended consequences, such as logjams. More importantly, they say, metal detectors send the wrong message to students. ""To me, there's a very negative message that is sent when you walk into your school building through metal detectors,"" Nigaglioni said. ""It just doesn't send that (message of) 'This is a safe and welcoming place' that you need to learn."" Wider, open hallways Hallways at new schools are designed to be open, collaborative spaces with clear lines of sight so that teachers and school administrators can observe. New schools also are being designed with wide, open hallways that provide clear lines of sight. This gives teachers, administrators and school resource officers the ability to stand at one spot and see what's going on all around. Having open hallways without nooks and crannies also gives surveillance cameras a fuller view of the school. In modern schools, these hallways function as throughways as well as collaborative working spaces similar to a Starbucks, Nigaglioni said. These open hallways also can be sealed off electronically in the case of an emergency, adding one more layer of security. In a lockdown, students would go to their classrooms and lock that door, too, creating yet another barrier. The overall idea is to create a collaborative learning environment that can function as another zone of security to allow time for police to arrive. The doors that separate this wing of the school from the main building can be electronically closed in a lockdown situation. ""That hardened approach, where everybody's in enclosed little silos, is not what we're attempting to do,"" Payne said. ""We're more interested in keeping the perpetrator or attacker at bay so the first responders can arrive in time."" Pruchnicki, of Bond Architects, said that classrooms are now labeled with large numbers that jut out from the wall. That makes it easier for first responders -- not to mention new students or substitute teachers -- to quickly locate a specific room on the school's campus. Of course, school security is much more than just the threat of active shootings. Schools also have to deal with bullying, sexual assaults, weather emergencies and estranged parents -- say, in a custody battle -- who may want to pull their kids out of school. The newest school designs have multiple focuses to address all of these issues. ""On a day-to-day basis, you want to design schools and focus on things that will help with monitoring, with supervision and communication, dealing with bullying prevention and those types of issues,"" Trump said. ""They go beyond just the tunnel vision focus on a shooter.""",Child Individualized Education Program School Indiana Student Education Learning disability Teacher Parent Job,"A student at the school in Parkland, Fla., which was designed by Art Bond, a firm that has designed many new schools.","(CNN) For school designers and architects , the current debate about how to make schools safer focuses too much on add-on measures.

""THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED!"" Trump tweeted shortly before 6 a.m. ""As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice [John Paul] Stevens, NO WAY. We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court!"" On Tuesday, Stevens penned an op-ed in the New York Times calling the Second Amendment a ""relic of the 18th century."" Stevens lauded the efforts of students across the country who marched on Saturday in protest to gun violence and their three demands for lawmakers: An assault weapons ban, end sales of high-capacity magazines and expand background checks for all gun purchases. Trending: F-35 Jet: Air Force Could Lose 590 Fighters If It Can’t Cut $14.5 Billion in Support Costs But Stevens had one more suggestion for the nascent activists: ""They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment. Stevens, now 97 and a retired jurist, was on the bench in 2008 when the Supreme Court heard a landmark case for the Second Amendment in District of Columbia v. Heller. In a 5-4 ruling—Stevens was among the dissenters—the court affirmed that individuals had a Constitutional right to own firearms. Don't miss: Religious Robber Makes Sign of the Cross Before Throwing Brick Through Brooklyn Store Window In writing for the majority, however, Justice Antonin Scalia also noted that, ""Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose."" Stevens isn't the first Supreme Court justice to express doubts over the Second Amendment. In 1991, then-retired Chief Justice Warren Burger, a Republican appointee, said the Second Amendment “has been the subject of one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word ‘fraud,’ on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.” Story continues The public debate over Second Amendment rights and gun control has roiled since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, ebbing and flowing according to high-profile shootings. The issue has again received heightened attention in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, when a 19-year-old armed with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle killed 17 people and wounded over a dozen more in under seven minutes. Most popular: Who Is Keith Raniere?

Trump later endorsed several gun control measures. Speaking with a bipartisan assembly of lawmakers at the White House on February 28, two weeks after the Stoneman Douglas shooting, Trump backed raising the minimum age to buy a firearm to 21 and universal background checks, as well as unlawfully seizing weapons without due process. “I like taking the guns early, like in this crazy man’s case that just took place in Florida [...] to go to court would have taken a long time,” Trump said during the meeting. “Take the guns first, go through due process second,” Trump said.

247,10170,https://www.yahoo.com/news/students-parents-demand-gun-curbs-florida-slaughter-180216051.html,"Trump visits Florida shooting survivors, FBI admits it missed tip","Pompano Beach (United States) (AFP) - US President Donald Trump on Friday visited a Florida hospital to offer comfort to those wounded in a mass school shooting, after the FBI admitted it mishandled a tip about the troubled teen behind the massacre that left 17 dead. The arrival of Trump and his wife Melania came at the end of a difficult day for the families of those killed in Wednesday's rampage at a high school in Parkland, Florida, who learned that the carnage could perhaps have been averted. The FBI admitted it had received a chilling warning in January from a tipster who said the 19-year-old gunman, Nikolas Cruz, could be planning a mass shooting, but that agents had failed to follow up. At Broward Health North Hospital, where Trump met with survivors of the shooting, the president thanked the doctors, nurses and first responders for their ""incredible"" work, and described the carnage as ""very sad."" He and his wife then headed to the Broward County sheriff's office, where they met with Florida Governor Rick Scott, Senator Marco Rubio, Sheriff Scott Israel and other law enforcement officers. Trump told the group he had met with a female survivor who had been shot four times, including in the lung, adding that quick first responders had saved her life. ""Give them a raise,"" he said. He later tweeted several pictures of himself and Melania, visiting with a survivor and her family, as well as posing with hospital staff. ""We are committed to working with state and local leaders to help secure our schools, and tackle the difficult issue of mental health,"" Trump wrote in an Instagram post alongside the picture. The president's visit to the Parkland area north of Miami came amid growing anger among parents and students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School over America's seeming unwillingness to toughen gun control laws. ""My princess wasn't safe in that school,"" said Andrew Pollack, speaking at the funeral of his 18-year-old daughter Meadow. Story continues ""Please pray that this horrific tragedy never happens to another family."" At the evening briefing at the sheriff's department, Rubio said: ""This is a community and a state that is in deep pain and they want action to make sure this doesn't happen again."" Trump replied: ""You can count on it."" - FBI chief under pressure - The FBI made a stunning admission earlier in the day, saying a ""person close to Nikolas Cruz"" made a call to the agency's public tipline on January 5 to ""report concerns about him."" ""The caller provided information about Cruz's gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting,"" the FBI said in a statement. The information from the caller ""should have been assessed as a potential threat to life"" and forwarded to the agency's Miami field office, it said. Instead, ""no further investigation was conducted."" ""We have spoken with victims and families, and deeply regret the additional pain this causes all those affected by this horrific tragedy,"" said Federal Bureau of Investigation director Christopher Wray, who took up his post in August. Wray said he was ""committed to getting to the bottom of what happened,"" and Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an immediate review to ensure ""effective response to indications of potential violence."" But Scott, the state governor, nevertheless called for the FBI chief to step down, saying the failure to act was ""unacceptable."" ""Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn't going to cut it,"" Scott said. The January warning to the FBI was not the first it had received about Cruz, who used an AR-15-style semi-automatic rifle that he legally purchased a year ago to spray classrooms with bullets. In September, the FBI was alerted to a message posted on YouTube, in which a user named Nikolas Cruz vowed: ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" The FBI said it had looked into it at the time but was unable to identify the person who made the post. Cruz was also known to local police after his mother ""repeatedly called police to the home to help deal with his violent outbursts, threats and self-destructive behavior,"" over the course of several years, according to CNN. - 'Illogical' - Trump's visit to the Parkland area -- not far from his Mar-a-Lago resort, where he will spend the long President's Day weekend -- was not announced in advance, perhaps because he risked being greeted with angry demands for action on gun laws. ""It's illogical that the law says a minor can't have a drink, but can buy a gun,"" said 47-year-old Mavy Rubiano, whose child survived the shooting. In Washington, the political response so far makes it clear that the powerful pro-gun National Rifle Association -- which spent $30 million to support Trump's election in 2016 -- remains formidable. As with previous mass shootings, the focus of gun control advocates was the easy availability of the AR-15, a civilian version of the US military's M16. Millions have been sold around the United States, and AR-15-style rifles were used in the mass shootings in Las Vegas, Sutherland Springs, Texas and Newtown, Connecticut.",Donald Trump Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Melania Trump Parkland President of the United States Hospital 2018 United States Senate election in Florida  Democratic Party Health,"President Trump and his wife, Melania, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Friday.","Pompano Beach (United States) (AFP) - US President Donald Trump on Friday visited a Florida hospital to offer comfort to those wounded in a mass school shooting, after the FBI admitted it mishandled a tip about the troubled teen behind the massacre that left 17 dead.","president donald trump met with florida governor rick scott, sen. marco rubio, sheriff scott and other law enforcement officers. the president's visit to the parkland area north of miami came amid growing anger among parents and students at marjory stoneman douglas high school over america's seeming unwillingness to toughen gun control laws. the fbi admitted it had received a chilling warning in january from a tipster who said the 19-year-old gunman, could be planning a mass shooting, but that agents had failed to follow up",1,2,3,5,4,0,1,0.0,10,0

Calling in to a Fox News program on Saturday night, Trump said “perhaps we’ll do something on age” as he ticked off other strategies he supports, including arming some schoolteachers with concealed weapons. “It doesn't seem to make sense that you have to wait until you are 21 years old to get a pistol, but to get a gun like this maniac used in the school, you get that at 18,” Trump said on “Justice with Judge Jeanine.” AD Trump told host Jeanine Pirro that he had “explained that to the NRA.” “They are great people,” the president said. “But I said, ‘Fellas, we have to get going on some really good legislation.'” AD In a statement last week, the NRA said raising the age limit on buying semiautomatic rifles to 21 would infringe on the constitutional rights of people who are 18 to 20 years old.",Dana Loesch Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) National Rifle Association Spokesperson NRATV Gun control Republican Party Gun Television Shooting,"Kellyanne Conway, the president of the National Rifle Association, at the White House in February.","“These are just things that he’s discussing right now,” Loesch said during an appearance on ABC News’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.” “I know that people are trying to find daylight between President Trump and 5 million law-abiding gun owners, and law-abiding gun owners all across the United States,” Loesch said, referring to the size of the NRA’s membership.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. A coalition of prominent gun control, teacher and civil rights groups is threatening legal action against the Department of Education if it moves forward with a controversial proposal that would allow states to spend federal funds on guns for school personnel. ""We are extraordinarily concerned with this dangerous, and what we believe to be unlawful, proposal under consideration to supply teachers with federal funds to buy gun for their classrooms, instead of books and school supplies,"" said Giffords Law Center chief counsel Adam Skaggs, whose group, which was co-founded by shooting victim and former Rep.

The suspect in a mass shooting that left two people dead and 12 with bullet wounds at a Madden 19 e-games tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday, carried two handguns and extra ammunition into the contest venue and specifically targeted his competition, authorities said Monday. The two people killed in the shooting allegedly committed by David Katz, 24, inside a back room bar at a Chicago Pizza restaurant in the Jacksonville Landing mall were considered the top two Madden gamers in the world, a competitor wounded in the rampage told ABC News. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News ""The suspect clearly targeted other gamers that were in a back room at the Chicago Pizza participating in this gaming tournament,"" Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said of Katz at a news conference Monday afternoon. ""The suspect walked passed patrons who were in other parts of the business and focused his attention on the gamers."" Meanwhile, court records obtained by ABC News in Baltimore from a divorce and child custody battle between Katz's parents show that Katz was treated in 2011 for mental health issues and that his mother informed the court that her son was suffering from depression and ""affective disorders."" Records also show that David Katz was once prescribed the antidepressants Risperdal and Fluoxetine. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News Sheriff Williams said Katz was armed with two handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9mm, one with a laser scope, on Sunday, but investigators believe he only used one of the weapons in the attack. ""Video surveillance from inside the restaurant clearly shows that this is a single shooter incident and that the suspect took his own life after shooting the victims,"" Williams said. He said Katz purchased both guns legally in Baltimore within the past month. Killed in the shooting were Elijah Clayton, 22, of Woodland Hills, California, and Taylor Robertson, 28, a married father of a young boy from Giles, West Virginia. Another 12 people were wounded in the shooting and a 13th person was injured fleeing the gunfire, Williams said. Police barricade a street near Jacksonville Landing in Jacksonville, Fla.,Aug. 26, 2018. Laura Heald/AP Clayton and Robertson were among the top players of the Madden NFL football e-game, according to EA Sports, publisher of the video game. Robertson -- nicknamed ""SpotMePlzzz"" -- was the defending champion of the Madden Classic, the Super Bowl for Madden gamers, held in Las Vegas. ""These two guys were two of the best Madden players in the world the last couple of years,"" Chris McFarland, a Madden gamer who was grazed in the head during Sunday shooting, told ABC News Monday from a Jacksonville hospital. Williams said Katz's motive for the shooting remains under investigation. In a video from a February 2017 interview Katz, who went by the nickname ""Bread,"" gave to an EA Sports announcer during a Madden regional competition in Buffalo, New York, he seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder for being seeded seventh in the tournament that he ended up winning.

Sheriff Williams said Katz's car was located in Jacksonville, and investigators found the hotel room where he was staying. He said both have been searched, but would not disclose if investigators seized any evidence pertinent to the shooting. Charles Spencer, special agent in charge of the FBI's Jacksonville office, said federal agents were also in Baltimore investigating Katz's background. ""We're tracking down where the subject was before he was here [in Jacksonville], where he stayed, who he had contact with,"" Spencer said. ""In Baltimore, our agents are working with the subject's family. His parents, both mother and father, have been fully cooperative with the FBI, so far. They have provided us access to all the records we've requested."" The court records obtained by ABC News also show that in May 2006, David Katz received psychiatric treatment at the Howard County General Hospital in Columbia, Maryland. His father, according to the records, disagreed with medicating his son because antidepressants ""may increase suicidal thoughts in young people.""

The documents also show that David Katz refused treatment.

At Arcadia First Baptist Church, Texas Governor Greg Abbott hugged survivors of the shooting and their parents and urged them to stay strong. ""We're here to support you,"" Abbott said. Some 500 congregants bowed their heads as interim Pastor Jerald Watkins offered prayers. ""It's time like this when all of us realize how fragile our lives really are,"" he said.

Speaking at the high school, Abott pledged ""swift and meaningful action"" to prevent future school massacres.

399,339,https://www.yahoo.com/news/federal-judge-blocks-3d-gun-145700870.html,"As a Federal Judge Blocks 3D Gun Blueprints, Trump Shifts Away From the NRA","Within 12 hours of Donald Trump tweeting that “3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public… doesn’t seem to make much sense,” a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to stop the release of downloadable blueprints, the conclusion of a settlement reached with the Trump administration in June after an unsuccessful 3-year court battle for Second Amendment proponents. Wednesday was intended to be the first day that computer-assisted drawing files for polymer-based guns, including an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle, would be posted to DefCad, an online hub for 3D-printed gun schematics. Debate between gun hobbyists and gun violence prevention groups peaked Tuesday afternoon when several state attorneys filed a lawsuit against DefCad’s parent company, Defense Distributed, the Second Amendment Foundation, the State Department, and other federal agencies that regulate weapons. I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2018 How Does the White House Feel About 3D-Printed Guns? The National Rifle Association has endorsed the 3D-printed gun schematics being published, defending it as an issue of innovation, free speech, and, of course, the Second Amendment. Trump has bowed to the NRA’s agenda of arming teachers and making guns easier to own, use, and purchase in the past, despite earlier promises that he would raise the age limit to purchase rifles and backing legislation for near-universal background checks. Trump’s tweet today, despite its vague sentiment, would indicate that he is not in support of widely available 3D-printed plastic guns. And the White House later reaffirmed that gesture by confirming that the administration stands behind an existing law that makes it illegal to own or produce plastic homemade guns. Story continues The issue of 3D-printed guns has definitely resonated with Democrats in terms of safety. Plastic guns cannot be tracked by a government database, since they have no serial numbers, and theoretically could be mass-produced for illicit activities. Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a cease-and-desist order against DefCad Tuesday, and Democrats in the House and Senate filed legislation that would ban guns made from any 3D-printed material. How Would 3D-Printed Guns Work and be Regulated? The files that allow internet users to print 3D plastic guns were already available and downloaded thousands of times on DefCad’s website before it was federally blocked in a four-year court case between Defense Distributed and the US government. During legal limbo, the lines of code that 3D-printer owners could use to make guns were still exchanged on torrenting sites. But the State Department settled with DefCad, and the site promised that the “age of the downloadable gun” was upon us. The gun schematics that are available to download illegally right now include the AR-15 style weapon, along with an AR-10 assault-style rifle, a pistol called the “Liberator,” and a Ruger 10/22. It has yet to be made clear in a court of law whether lines of code can even count as free speech that necessitates constitutional protection. In fact, the ethical issues surrounding the 3D-printing of weapons has barely entered the public or legal consciousness before now. Until now, DefCad has undeniably been the victor of its legal battle with the US government to share files. Tuesday’s temporary block will do little, if anything, to stop the information that has already been shared and downloaded thousands of times online. No lawyer or judge has been able to put a stop to it since the site launched in 2012, and the Trump administration’s June settlement of this year laid a foundation for a successful First and Second Amendment argument for DefCad. Despite efforts of high-ranking Democrats, once the code reaches the internet, there’s no stopping it. The most realistic course for law enforcement moving forward is a comprehensive set of new regulations for possession, production, and sale of 3D-printed weapons.

William Peduto, Pittsburgh's Democrat mayor, warned the visit would be a “distraction” and pull focus from the funerals of the 11 worshippers who were gunned down during the weekend massacre. The first two funerals are scheduled for later today. “If the president is looking to come to Pittsburgh, I would ask that he not do so while we are burying the dead,” Peduto said. PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTER TENDED TO BY JEWISH DOCTORS AND NURSES, OFFICIALS SAY The mayor also said the city does not have enough public safety officials to provide “enough protection at the funerals and to be able, at the same time, to draw attention away to a potential presidential visit.” Peduto and Trump butted heads over the weekend after the president suggested that armed guards in places of worship would help curb shootings. Peduto strongly pushed back on Trump's remarks, a familiar refrain by the president. Pittsburgh City Councilman Corey O’Connor also believes Trump should postpone his trip and said the city’s “hearts and minds are going to be on the victims” and not wrapped up in a “national distraction.” Others came down even harder on the president. ROBERT BOWERS, SUSPECT IN PITTSBURGH SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING, HAS FIRST FEDERAL COURT APPEARANCE Bend the Arc, a Jewish organization whose mission statement says they are ""rising up in solidarity with everyone threatened by the Trump agenda"", published an open letter that said he would not be welcome in Pittsburgh until he denounced white nationalism and stopped “targeting” minorities. Several mourners Fox News spoke to near the synagogue Monday night say they want Trump to stay away and let the city heal. “He’s only coming here to use us for political gain,” Pittsburgh native Nelson Suter told Fox News. “Let us grieve. Give us this moment. Don’t make it all about yourself for once.” Lynnette Lederman, the former president of the synagogue, added: “I do not welcome this president to my city.” But not everyone wants Trump to call off the trip. PITTSBURGH RESIDENTS MOURNING AFTER MASS SHOOTING, SOUND OFF ON GUN CONTROL “It’s not inappropriate for him to come,” Jim Roddey, former chairman of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County, told NBC-affiliate WPXI. “However, he has been very active in the midterms…and I hope he’s not going to come here and have a rally. That’s not what the city needs. It’s not what the people want.” Mourner Luke Thompson told Fox News he was cautiously optimistic. “If he wants to come here, fine,” he said. “I just hope and pray he’s respectful.” Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, who was leading services at the Tree of Life Synagogue during Saturday’s shooting, told CNN “the President of the United States is always welcome.” “I’m a citizen.

708,10862,http://us.cnn.com/2018/03/27/politics/repealing-the-second-amendment/index.html,There's not a 'snowflake's chance in hell' of repealing the Second Amendment,"(CNN) How could those high school kids have marched en masse and not achieved any meaningful reform? That seems to be the state of affairs: The gun laws seem intractably set, despite growing public support to change them, at least on the periphery of the laws. Measures passed in Florida after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting seem to have no prospects at the national level. But former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is not talking about frittering around the edges of anything. He issued a modest proposal in The New York Times to get rid of the Second Amendment altogether. Repeal it, he says Stevens argued that a right to bear arms, which the Supreme Court has said the Second Amendment guarantees, should mean something different in the era of today's weapons and today's civil society, and, in the spirit of many gun-control advocates, pointed out the Second Amendment is talking about militias when it brings up ""arms."" The entire text of the Second Amendment, remember, is this: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Stevens has railed in the past about how far we've gotten from the idea of militias in the interpretation of the Second Amendment -- and he channels that view in the op-ed. ""Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed,'"" he writes in the Times. ""Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century."" He then launches into a Supreme Court history lesson on how gun laws evolved from 1789 to a unanimous decision against sawed-off shotguns in 1939 because they weren't appropriate for use in a ""well-regulated militia"" -- through the landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller that threw the whole idea of a well-regulated militia out the window. That case changed the interpretation of the Second Amendment's clause concerning guns to be an individual right for self-defense. Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in the case, by the way, is a marvel of grammatical gymntastics , that decides the amendment is not about the well-regulated militia discussed in the text, but rather that ""it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home."" Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford, but he often sided with the more liberal wing of the court during his tenure and he resigned during the Obama administration, resulting in Elena Kagan being confirmed to take his spot on the bench. So he's bringing a more liberal mindset to this issue. It's also unlikely to happen. Probably ever. Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and Second Amendment expert who supports gun control, was tweeting Tuesday about Stevens' piece, and said, ""there's not a snowflake's chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment any time soon."" Of course all this overlooks the obvious problem: There's not a snowflakes chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment anytime soon. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 ""We can't even get Congress to pass a law banning bump stocks,"" Winkler wrote. ""We can't get Congress to mandate universal background checks. And Stevens thinks 2/3s of Congress will vote to repeal the 2A? And 3/4 of the states will ratify such an amendment? Nonsense."" But it's still worth examining whether repealing the Second Amendment is actually that what people want. There is, indeed, great support for tighter gun laws -- seven in 10 Americans said in a CNN poll after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting that they'd support new gun restrictions. That's the highest such support in 25 years. But on more specific proposals that could be seen as limiting gun rights, there were very partisan divides. A ban on semi-automatic weapons, for instance, had the support of 80% of Democrats and 53% of independents, but just 34% of Republicans, for instance. The idea of limiting the number of guns an individual can own garners 69% support among Democrats vs. just 23% among Republicans, according to that CNN poll. It's hard to find any recent reliable polling on the larger idea of repealing the amendment completely, but if there are sharp divides on specific efforts to curb gun rights, it's a good bet that an entire repeal would be even more controversial. A minority of American households have guns -- 30%, according to a Pew survey in 2017, with 16% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans owning guns. It's important here to say that Stevens did not say in his op-ed that guns should be taken away from anyone who has them, just that the Second Amendment should be repealed. What would be left to regulate the many millions of guns already in the country? That would have to be figured out. But you can hear the slogan opponents would use against an effort like Stevens' proposal: They're trying to take your guns away! In fact, that's a slogan President Donald Trump used effectively against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016 (and since then), accusing her of wanting to ""take your guns away"" even though Clinton said she was a supporter of Second Amendment rights. JUST WATCHED Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' 01:13 Winkler also argued that Stevens' proposal is counterproductive because it backs up the claim by Trump and the NRA that supporters of gun control want to take away guns. ""Stevens's call to repeal the 2A is not only ineffective but worse: it makes it even harder to pass good gun laws today. It plays right into the hands of the @nra which can now point to this op-ed and say, 'See, we told you they want to take away your rights and your guns.'"" Current Democratic leaders, even as they have pushed for new gun control, have made clear they support the Second Amendment. If national elections are going to be won and lost in the Rust Belt, Democrats will need support from gun rights supporters if they're going to win congressional or presidential elections. ""I believe in the Second Amendment, there's a right to bear arms,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in February. ""Every law-abiding citizen has the right to have a gun unless you're a felon, or you're adjudicated mentally ill, everyone agrees to that."" Even if Democrats turned wholesale against the Second Amendment (and gave up any claim they had on moderates and gun lovers in their party), there's the not-so-small difficulty of actually changing the Constitution. The Constitution has been amended 27 times in US history, including the original 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. The last amendment ratified was the 27th in 1992, which made it so Congress can't raise its own wages until the following Congress. That took decades to pass. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and CNN contributor, said it's not impossible to repeal the Second Amendment, but perhaps Stevens was trying to reframe the arguments. ""I wonder if Justice Stevens was trying to take a step back from the politics of the moment to situate the debate in a broader context,"" he said, although he pointed out that changes to the Constitution have been few and far between. ""There have only been 17 amendments in 231 years, and most of those have been about the structure of government/elections/voting, not substantive rights. It's really quite difficult to get an amendment through, especially on a divisive question of social policy,"" Vladeck said. None of the original 10 amendments has ever been repealed or changed, so you're well into uncharted territory with Stevens' idea. The only amendment which really took something away from citizens was the 18th Amendment, which was enacted in 1920 and made alcohol illegal on the national level. And maybe the precedent for what Stevens proposes is the 21st Amendment, by which the 18th Amendment was repealed 13 years later. It takes an amendment to repeal an amendment. Article V of the Constitution lays out that process, which requires supermajorities in Congress and of state legislatures and/or constitutional conventions. So politically and procedurally, Stevens' idea is a conversation-starter (and maybe a much-needed conversation-starter), but not much else. Repealing the Second Amendment isn't likely to happen any time soon. To say the least. But Stevens doesn't seem to be worried about those details. He's making a broader point about the court and guns. Later in his piece, Stevens suggests the entire aim of getting rid of the Second Amendment would be to overturn that decision in Heller, which made gun ownership an individual right. ""Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option,"" he writes. I agree! We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the 2A, gun control proponents need to mobilize politically. That seems to be happening now. https://t.co/IS1cYJuWwT — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 Winkler said marchers and other activists should stay the course they are on. ""We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the (Second Amendment), gun control proponents need to mobilize politically,"" he wrote. Vladeck argued there is plenty of gun control legislation that can be achieved under the current structure and he pointed to a Maryland assault weapons case as proof. ""So we may not need either a different Supreme Court or a constitutional amendment to achieve most of what reformers are seeking; we just need folks to realize that the principal objections to many of these proposals are political, not constitutional,"" Vladeck said.","Gun Remington Arms Remington Outdoor Company Inc.

It begins innocuously: “A is for ALICE the young science whiz.” But by the time “D is for DANA who had a hall pass” is introduced, an ominous shadow lurks outside the child’s classroom door.

610,271,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-posting-of-online-plans-for-3d-printed-guns/,Judge blocks posting of online plans for 3D printed guns,"A U.S. judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration Monday from allowing a Texas company to post online plans for making untraceable 3D guns, agreeing with 19 states and the District of Columbia that such access to the plastic guns would pose a security risk. The states sued to stop an agreement that the government had reached with Austin, Texas-based Defense Distributed, saying guidelines on how to print undetectable plastic guns could be acquired by felons or terrorists. U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik extended a temporary restraining order, and his new decision will last until the case is resolved. He said Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed, wanted to post the plans online so that citizens can arm themselves without having to deal with licenses, serial numbers and registrations. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Wilson has said that ""governments should live in fear of their citizenry."" ""It is the untraceable and undetectable nature of these small firearms that poses a unique danger,"" Lasnik said. ""Promising to detect the undetectable while at the same time removing a significant regulatory hurdle to the proliferation of these weapons - both domestically and internationally - rings hollow and in no way ameliorates, much less avoids, the harms that are likely to befall the states if an injunction is not issued."" The State Department had reached the settlement with the company after the agency removed the 3D gun-making plans from a list of weapons or technical data that cannot be exported overseas. The states argued that the federal agency didn't follow the law when it removed 3D guns from the munitions list. They said the government was supposed to notify Congress and provide a 30-day window before making a change to that list, but it did not. Lasnik criticized the government for switching its position on the threat posed by the 3D gun-making plans. Up until April, the government argued the distribution of the guidelines ""posed a threat to world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States,"" the judge said. Despite those fears, the government decided that it only needed to restrict the international availability of firearms up to .50 caliber. That's when they reached a settlement with the 3D gun company. There was no indication the government evaluated the unique characteristics of the plastic guns when it considered deleting that category of weapons from the prohibited list, the judge said. ""Nor is there any reasoned explanation for its change in position,"" Lasnik said. The federal government declined to comment on the judge's ruling. A lawyer with the U.S. Justice Department had argued against the injunction, saying possessing 3D plastic guns is already against the law, and the federal government is committed to enforcing that law. But the judge said it wasn't enough. ""While the court appreciates the earnestness with which this commitment was made at oral argument, it is of small comfort to know that, once an undetectable firearm has been used to kill a citizen of Delaware or Rhode Island or Vermont, the federal government will seek to prosecute a weapons charge in federal court while the state pursues a murder conviction in state court,"" Lasnik said. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson praised the ruling. ""Once again, I'm glad we put a stop to this dangerous policy,"" Ferguson said.

Their emotions ran raw and unvarnished, many bravely taking to social media to publicly post what they feel the world needs to hear. ""I don't feel safe."" ""What is our world coming to?"" ""I want my friends back."" The heartbreaking thoughts echoed online, making the reality of how our children are growing up just a little too real. Lockdown drills and school shootings are the only life they have known. CNN has blurred the names of the teens who shared these posts on social media for their safety and to protect their privacy. ""It just sucks that this is something we now have to worry about,"" Leo, 15, from Massachusetts, told CNN. ""It's not just a few people, but literally an entire country has to worry about if they're going to die at school today or tomorrow, this period or next period."" The day of the Parkland shooting, which claimed 17 lives, Leo had an ALICE drill , which is a type of school lockdown drill. ""There are times where not a lot is going on in class and I think, 'What if the alarm goes off right now?' This is something constantly on our minds. It's like the new normal."" Leo was on YouTube when he saw a news organization post about the Florida school shooting on Wednesday. At first, he said he didn't have much of a reaction. It's hard not to become desensitized, he said. ""When I saw everything that was lost and the footage inside, when I started thinking about the drills earlier and my anxiety has been through the roof this week, I'm annoyed and upset that this is still happening."" Leo and his classmate Rylie, also 15, have been talking a lot after the Florida shooting. She texted Leo annoyed that people were making light of what happened. ""I was in gym class and people were joking around. Everyone's joking and it's not funny,"" Rylie told CNN. She also mentioned the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, saying it was a good example of how teachers are saving lives in these situations. She and her friends have talked about being ""pretty lucky to have teachers putting us first."" While Rylie didn't publicly post on social media, she said she shared a simple message with her friends on Snapchat. Many teens shared messages about not feeling safe in school. Others called out for schools to do more to teach students what to do in these situations. Across the ocean, 15-year-old Ethan from the United Kingdom posted a similar message of not feeling safe at his high school anymore. ""I'm not afraid, but if this happened in that school, how do I know it's not going to happen in my school?"" he told CNN. The British teen talked about the slight comfort he has from living in a country where gun ownership laws are much stricter. ""It's better over here because we can't buy guns. I think that needs to happen in America, as well,"" he said. ""But there are still knives and other things that could be taken into schools."" Ethan also started talking about what solutions he sees to making shootings like this less common. ""I think guns need to be less widely available,"" he said. ""I think metal detectors should be compulsory. If there was a metal detector in the at school, he would not have been able to get to all those students."" Leo, the American, had strong feelings about what we can do as a country to make this stop. Seeing politicians post with their thoughts and prayers isn't helping, he said. ""I feel like actually taking it seriously would be a good start. We haven't seen any action from lawmakers,"" he said. Beyond the charged words about gun control and how America can fix its trend of school shootings, there are the powerful stories of the people who survived. And the young lives that were lost. Aidan, a teen who hid in his math class while the shooter was loose, shared advice with another teen who is now afraid to go to school. ""James, do not be afraid. Learn from what these survivors did and the routes they [have] taken. Learn from those who were slain, and always be aware,"" he wrote. ""Love everyone; even your bullies.""",Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Mass shooting Shooting School shooting School Gun control AR-15 style rifle National Rifle Association Mass murder,"A memorial to the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday.","(CNN) Teens are not staying silent about what happened at a high school in Florida this week.

And yesterday we didn't really get too much of a sense of Judge Kavanaugh, because all we had was a prepared statement by him and a lot of skirmishing about other things. But, today, we started to get that. And I think the first interchange you played, which was about guns, I think Marcia set it up exactly right. The one thing I would add, though, is that President Trump wanted someone who is very pro-guns. And he got it in this nominee. I mean, Judge Kavanaugh's opinion, the one that Marcia is referring to, is one in which he dissented and said there is a right to semiautomatic rifles. That's something the Supreme Court had never said. And indeed his two Republican nominated colleagues on his own court, the D.C. Circuit, including Doug Ginsburg, who was President Reagan's nominee, said, oh, no, the Second Amendment doesn't require that. So you have got a view of the Second Amendment that's really far outside of the mainstream in Judge Kavanaugh. But that's, of course, what President Trump campaigned on, on what he wanted. But then, with respect to the other question that you're asking, which is about pardons and all the stuff that came up today, it was extraordinary to hear in a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing talk about whether the president can pardon himself, can he be indicted, can he be subpoenaed? That just shows, I think, where we are in 2018, given the nominator here, President Trump, who's facing any number of problems, including being fingered by his own personal counsel, Michael Cohen, as implicated in some crimes. I think Judge Kavanaugh did what every nominee did with — does with respect to those questions, which is dodge and weave them.

The news outlet reported that, within a day of the shooting, ATF leadership was flooded with internal and external messages asking whether the bureau had approved the supplementary devices used by Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock, and whether it planned to ban them. “Are these ‘ATF approved’ as advertised?” ATF Director Tom Brandon asked technology branch chief Earl Griffith the day after the shooting, according to emails obtained by USA Today. ADVERTISEMENT Emails showed that public affairs staff encouraged bureau employees to avoid referring to bump stocks as ATF ""approved,"" but rather to explain that the ATF has the power to ""classify"" or ""evaluate"" the devices, which allow weapons to fire at a faster rate, mimicking machine guns. Other emails showed officials discussing an uptick in demand for bump stocks, as well as criticism from outside observers over the ATF's perceived inaction on the devices. ATF spokesman Brad Engelbert told USA Today that the emails reflect individual personal opinions, and are not the official position of the ATF. A call to ban bump stocks found broad support after the Las Vegas shooting, which left 58 people dead and hundreds more wounded.

783,10368,http://finance.yahoo.com/news/former-supreme-court-justice-stevens-repeal-second-amendment-135030186.html,Former Supreme Court Justice Stevens: Repeal the Second Amendment,"A retired Supreme Court justice believes the March for Our Lives protesters are aiming too low by asking lawmakers simply to reform the nation’s gun laws. “The demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform,” John Paul Stevens wrote in a New York Times op-ed published on Tuesday. “They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment.” Stevens, 97, argues that the amendment — which states “a well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed” — was born out of concern that a “national standing army might pose a threat to the security” of individual states and is “a relic of the 18th century.” In 2008, Stevens was among four dissenters in the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision in a landmark case, District of Columbia v. Heller, that held the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to bear arms for self-defense. “That decision — which I remain convinced was wrong and certainly was debatable — has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power,” Stevens wrote in his op-ed. “Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the N.R.A.’s ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option.” Slideshow: Scenes from March for Our Lives rallies around the world >>> Protesters at a “March For Our Lives” rally in Sacramento, Calif., on Saturday. (Photo: Bob Strong/Reuters) More Hundreds of thousands of people participated in Saturday’s anti-gun-violence marches in Washington, D.C., and numerous locations throughout the country, demanding Congress act to protect students in the wake of last month’s massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Many of the demonstrators chastised the gun lobby on signs and in speeches while expressing support for stricter background checks, an increase in the minimum age to buy certain firearms and a ban on semiautomatic weapons. But most did not call for an outright repeal of the Second Amendment as Stevens is suggesting. “That simple but dramatic action would move Saturday’s marchers closer to their objective than any other possible reform,” he wrote. “It would eliminate the only legal rule that protects sellers of firearms in the United States — unlike every other market in the world. It would make our schoolchildren safer than they have been since 2008 and honor the memories of the many, indeed far too many, victims of recent gun violence.” National polls show broad support for measures to reduce gun violence, including universal background checks, age restrictions and a ban on assault weapons. A Fox News poll released on Sunday found 53 percent of American voters believe “protecting citizens from gun violence” is more important than “protecting the right of citizens to own guns,” compared to 40 percent who believe the opposite. At the White House on Tuesday, press secretary Sarah Sanders said that “the president and the administration still fully support the Second Amendment.” “We think the focus has to remain on removing weapons from dangerous individuals — not on blocking all Americans from their constitutional rights,” Sanders said. Meanwhile, gun rights activists say the weekend demonstrations were an “attack” on the Second Amendment. In Washington on Saturday, David Hogg, a Parkland survivor and one of the organizers of the March for Our Lives, criticized television pundits for painting him as antigun. “They’ve made it seem like I’m trying to take away people’s guns — that I’m against the Second Amendment,” Hogg said. “My father is a retired FBI agent. I have guns in my house. I’m not against the Second Amendment.” Cameron Kasky, another Marjory Stoneman Douglas student, made a similar point on “Fox News Sunday.”",John Paul Stevens Supreme Court of the United States March for Our Lives Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Repeal Constitutional amendment  Law Gun control,"A rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday.","A retired Supreme Court justice believes the March for Our Lives protesters are aiming too low by asking lawmakers simply to reform the nation’s gun laws. “The demonstrators should seek more effective and more lasting reform,” John Paul Stevens wrote in a New York Times op-ed published on Tuesday. “They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment.”","a retired supreme court justice believes the march for our lives protesters is aiming too low by asking lawmakers to reform the nation's gun laws. a new york times op-ed published on tuesday said that the amendment should demand a repeal of the second amendment. the first amendment protects an individual’s right to bear arms for self-defense.a. with a propaganda weapon of immense power, the n.r.a.",1,2,2,99,8,0,1,99.0,5,99

Nearly two decades ago, a pair of Littleton, Colorado, students named Dylan Klebold, 17, and Eric Harris, 18, carried out a killing spree at Columbine that law enforcement experts called a watershed event in the response to active shooters. Within 13 minutes of the first 911 call, Klebold and Harris fatally shot 12 students and a teacher and wounded 23 other people before killing themselves with gunshot wounds to the head. SWAT teams entered the school 47 minutes after the gunfire erupted. An exhaustive FBI review of the police response at Columbine led to a more rapid response strategy during active shooter situations, according to Gagliano. JUST WATCHED Victim's mom begs Trump: Do something! Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Victim's mom begs Trump: Do something! 02:41 The ""stark and important"" lessons learned from the Columbine response, which was widely criticized, may have helped save lives Wednesday at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Gagliano said. Before the Colorado shooting, responding officers would set up a secure perimeter around the crime scene before even thinking about moving on the suspect. In Parkland, authorities say Nikolas Cruz, 19, fatally shot 17 people at his former school before blending in with the students and staff rushing out of the school building. He was arrested in a neighboring community later in the day. ""Nowadays, what we do is go to the sound of the guns,"" Gagliano said. ""You get one, two, three, four people together. We're trained. We use particular formations."" Gagliano called it a ""heterogeneous group"" of first responders that could include local, state and federal agencies. ""You're going to the sound of the guns,"" he said. ""The No. 1 goal is to interdict the shooter or shooters. In the old days, you took land. You went in. You clear the room. Then you slowly and methodically move to clear the next room. In this instance ... get to the shooter as quickly as possible and that's what they clearly did here."" The tactic, known in law enforcement circles as rapid deployment involving the first officer at the scene, began in earnest after the Columbine shooting. More than half of mass shooting incidents are still in progress when officers arrive on the scene, with 75% requiring law enforcement to confront the shooter before the threat ends, Katherine Schweit, a former senior FBI official, wrote in a 2013 FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin article. JUST WATCHED Student: I heard shot that killed teacher Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Student: I heard shot that killed teacher 02:01 A study of 35 active shooter incidents during 2012 found that 37% ended in less than five minutes and 63% in less than 15 minutes, according to Schweit. The average active shooter incident lasts 12 minutes. The lessons learned from Columbine led the US Justice Department and other federal agencies to partially fund an active shooter program known as Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training , or ALERRT, Schweit wrote. The training, which was developed by the San Marcos, Texas, Police Department and the Hays County, Texas, Sheriff's Department and adopted by Texas State University in San Marcos, includes a 16-hour course that ""prepares first responders to isolate, distract and end the threat when an active shooter is engaged,"" according to Schweit. Since its creation in 2002, more than 105,000 law enforcement officers have been trained through the ALERRT program.

HOUSTON, TX -- With a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue still fresh in America’s memory, some of the nation's leading gun control advocates took their campaigns this weekend to Texas, a deep-red state with more registered guns than any U.S. state, according to a 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""We must do something — we must stop gun violence,"" Gabby Giffords — the former Arizona congresswoman who survived a gunshot to the head during a mass shooting in 2011, said during back-to-back campaign events on Saturday for Democratic candidate Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in Texas' 7th Congressional District. ""Do you have the courage to fight? Stand with me. Vote, vote, vote!"" she said. Giffords, who suffers from aphasia — a condition that impedes her communication skills due to damage from being shot on the left side of her brain — let her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, do much of the talking on the campaign trail. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona who survived an assassination attempt in 2011, flanked by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., left, and Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., right, joins House Democrats in a call for action on gun safety legislation on the House steps Wednesday morning after the deadly mass shooting in Las Vegas this week, at the Capitol in Washington, Wednesday, Oct. 4, 2017. AP ""The answer is not more guns, and this is coming from a gun owner,"" Kelly said during a Texas town hall forum that concluded the couple's nationwide ""Vote Save Lives"" tour. ""Logically, that doesn't make sense,"" Kelly told ABC News. ""If the answer was more guns, we would already live in the safest country on the planet, because of the number of firearms that are here and the number of people that already carry them. It does not pass the logic test."" Sen. Ted Cruz debates Rep. Beto O'Rourke in a televised debate on Oct. 16, 2018 in San Antonio. Tom Reel/Pool via Getty Images Kelly touched on the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that claimed the lives of 11 victims, and on the president's response to the massacre. ""Arming the security guard wouldn't have stopped anything,"" Kelly said. Giffords and Kelly were joined by some of the most outspoken gun reform activists from Parkland, Fla., and Santa Fe High School in Galveston County, TX, Friday at the University of Houston to encourage other young people to cast votes in Texas' upcoming midterms. ""November 6 is not the deadline,"" said David Hogg, a survivor of the mass shooting in Parkland in February that killed 17 students and staffers. ""It's the start of a revolution. ""I'm ready to see this country be what it says it is on paper,"" Hogg added. Megan Mcguire, a 17-year-old high school senior who survived a mass shooting at Sante Fe High School in May that left 10 dead, assailed Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, but praised his Democratic opponent Beto O'Rourke. ""Ted Cruz, we have tried to contact him through email, through phone call — we have tried to set meetings and he refused to meet with us,"" she said. Mcguire told the crowd she was too young to vote, but encouraged them to vote on her behalf. ""Beto sat down with a note pad and pen and paper and asked how we felt,"" Mcguire said of O'Rourke. ""He promised us he would change how things are happening. That was really important to me."" In the closely watched Senate race, O'Rourke and Cruz share different views on gun reform. During his campaign trail, O'Rourke has not shied away from expressing his sentiments on gun control in a state where recent mass shootings have energized the issue on the campaign trail. ""Thoughts and prayers, Senator Cruz, are just not going to cut it anymore. The people of Texas, the children of Texas deserve action,"" O'Rourke said during he and Cruz's first debate in September. Cruz, who backed President Trump's suggestions of arming teachers and adding more armed police officers in schools, has targeted O'Rourke and his polices on gun control, attempting to garner support from Texans who wish for their current gun laws to remain the same. Cruz released a campaign ad saying the democrat ""wants to take our guns."" Fletcher, who shares similar values on gun reform as O'Rourke, said she's optimistic she'll help transition the current gun legislation Texas and the country needs no matter which aisle of the spectrum representatives are on. ""We need to make sure we've got members of Congress who are willing to work across the aisle and understand there is no monopoly on good ideas, but that we all need to actually do the work of governing,"" Fletcher told ABC News.

Mourners embrace outside of the Thousand Oaks Teen Center where relatives and friends gathered in the aftermath of the Wednesday night mass shooting. Photograph: Marcio José Sánchez/AP Residents stood in silent shock and grief outside a California bar on Thursday where a former US marine had burst in the night before and shot dead 12 people, including a police officer. But some made their feelings known by carrying signs. “Gun control now” read one carried by Grace Fisher, who had come from her nearby home to the scene of the mass shooting to pay her respects. Late on Wednesday night, college country and western line-dancing night was taking place at the Borderline Bar and Grill when, according to law enforcement, Ian Long, 28, entered and wrought tragedy with a handgun. Fisher, who was carrying her baby with her, came after hearing about the tragedy from a neighbor. “I just couldn’t sit at home and be sad,” she said. “I had to get out and come hold my sign and say: we demand more.” Other locals in this quiet Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks stood as an impromptu and subdued citizens’ honor guard as the body of Ventura county sheriff’s deputy Ron Helus was taken from the hospital, where he had died just hours after being shot as he rushed the gunman. His remains were being transported to the medical examiner’s office. One man held up a sign saying, simply, “Hero Helus”. View photos People attend the procession for the Ventura county Sgt Ron Helus, who was shot and killed in a mass shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Photograph: Ringo Chiu/Reuters More Cody Coffman, a 22-year-old who hoped to join the army, was among the dead. His father described himself as “heartbroken”. Justin Meek, 23, a recent graduate from nearby California Lutheran University, was also killed. The university said Meek had “heroically saved lives in the incident”. The streets became packed full of local residents as Helus’s body was transported from the hospital. They had brought American flags to wave, a poignant gesture on a grim day. No one had organized the gathering. It was a spontaneous coming-together by locals upset and scared at what had happened in their midst. “I’m still kind of in shock,” said Hannah, a local resident who preferred not to make her full name public. She was also outraged. “These kind of shootings have been happening way too often.” But she was also comforted by the turnout of people to pay tribute. “It’s the biggest thing I can remember,” she said. “It’s why I love living here and being from here. Everyone shows up for each other.” Back outside the Borderline bar, where many of the patrons on Wednesday night had attended California Lutheran, Pepperdine and other nearby colleges, red-eyed students in university sweatshirts hugged each other and wept. California Lutheran, just a 10-minute drive north of the bar, planned to hold a vigil for the victims on Thursday afternoon. Classes were cancelled at the private liberal arts college, as students and staff came to terms with the shooting. “Something like this is just really unheard of,” said Richard Hurst, an adjunct professor in geology at CLU. Hurst described a safe community in which crime was rare. He said a number of students were consoling each other in the campus chapel. “There’s a lot of students literally just buckled over crying,” he said. Coffman’s father, Jason Coffman, described the 22-year-old as having “love for everybody”. He said: “There was so many people that he touched and now are going to be just as heartbroken as I am. This is a heart that I’ll never get back.” Cody was pronounced dead at the scene, his father said. He wanted to join the military. “He was on his way to fulfilling his dream of serving the country,” Coffman said.

(Reuters) - David Ortner adjusted his yarmulke, cocked his pistol and took aim - something he wishes a civilian had done to defend Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue three days ago when Robert Bowers walked in and shot 11 people dead. ""When this happens, you get a wake-up call,"" said Ortner, a 28-year-old owner of an optician shop in Monsey, New York. Ortner was one of nine Jewish men who attended a one-day course on Tuesday at the privately owned Cherev Gidon Israeli Tactical Defense Academy near Scranton, Pennsylvania, a class that was scheduled on Sunday in response to the Pittsburgh synagogue attack. He was there to learn how to use a gun to protect himself and his community and prevent a repeat of Saturday's massacre, the deadliest targeting Jewish people in U.S. history. ""The fact is, we're at war,"" said Yonatan Stern, a veteran officer of the Israel Defense Forces and director of the academy, told his class. ""We want every Jew in America armed."" In the six years since Stern started the academy, demand for firearms training had never been higher than after Saturday's attack. Hundreds of interested students contacted Stern in the last 72 hours. All but three or four were Jewish. The spike in demand follows President Donald Trump's statement that the shooting might have been prevented if the synagogue had employed an armed guard. But many Jews have resisted the idea that having guns in synagogues is the best way to prevent such attacks. Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of the Kansas Interfaith Action, an advocacy organization, said on Tuesday that he did not believe Trump’s call for more armed guards could prevent attacks on places of worship. “What kind of country we're going to be if every house of worship has to have an armed guard?” Rieber said. “I think having less access to that kind of weaponry is going to be much more effective in the long run than having a single armed guard.” Story continues According to Stern, an armed guard at a synagogue is a useful deterrent but not a replacement for armed civilians, since a shooter could kill the armed guard before entering and killing congregants. ""To wait for law enforcement to arrive simply is not the answer,"" Stern said. Some of the students attending the course were card-carrying National Rifle Association members. Some had never fired a gun before. Two worked in schools and wanted to defend Jewish children. Many of them intended to bring guns to their synagogues on the next Sabbath for protection. ""Everybody has to find a way to react; this is my way,"" said Zev Guttman, who said he was scared of guns until Saturday's shooting convinced him he had to be armed. Tuesday's course, held in a log cabin on an outdoor shooting range in rural Honesdale, about 300 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, consisted of active-shooter response drills using handguns and rifles. Students practiced drawing concealed weapons, loading and firing AR-15 rifles at bulls-eye targets. Stern said that it ""touches my heart"" to see his students in training because he knows they will return to their synagogues as a first line of defense.

Carolyn McCarthy did 22 years ago. McCarthy came to Congress more than two decades ago after gunman Colin Ferguson killed her husband and injured her son in the Long Island Rail Road shooting in the fall of 1993. Upon her election, McCarthy became the leading voice in Congress on firearms. McBath will enter Congress with a similar tale. Her teenage son Jordan Davis was shot and killed in what is regarded as a racially-motivated killing in Florida in November 2012. A jury convicted Michael Dunn in the killing. He’s now serving a life sentence. So now McBath comes to Washington – with a similar life experience as McCarthy. Granted, other lawmakers have campaigned on tightening up firearms laws, like Rep. Robin Kelly, D-Ill., and Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn. There was a huge march in Washington earlier this year after the Parkland, Fla., massacre. Democratic politicians argued that somehow, after Columbine and Tucson and Sandy Hook and Aurora and Las Vegas, that Parkland was different. There was the Pittsburgh synagogue slaughter just before the midterms. Two days after the election, we added Thousand Oaks, Calif., to the roster. Democrats will soon seize control of the House and are promising tougher gun measures. After all, voters elected nearly 20 Democrats who advocate additional gun restrictions. Reps.-elect Jennifer Wexton, D-Va., and Jason Crow, D-Colo., toppled NRA-supported Reps. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., and Mike Coffman, R-Colo. But there will be fewer Democrats in the Senate next year. And those who were re-reelected – like moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., – have a very different view of gun control than urban liberals. It’s unclear if Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., will retain his seat against Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott. Parkland prominences Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg have long criticized Scott. Granted, the NRA downgraded Scott’s gun rating after the Parkland butchery. But if Scott prevails over Nelson, gun control advocates may have lost ground in their efforts in the Senate. That’s remarkable when so many characterized Parkland as the seminal moment in the gun control battle. Just how seminal was it after all? There were all of the TV interviews. All of the heart-rending stories. The big rally on Pennsylvania Ave. in the shadow of the U.S. Capitol. And yet… If those who wish to curb gun rights can’t even defeat the sitting governor of the state where the most recent major school shooting unfolded, how much progress did they make really? This is why the victory by McBath in Georgia deserves scrutiny by firearm control advocates. McBath defeated Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga., who narrowly won a special election last year over Democrat Jon Ossoff. Who represented the district before Handel? Former Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga. Price resigned his seat to become Health and Human Services Secretary. In his last three congressional races, Price won with 64 percent of the vote in 2012, 66 percent in 2014 and 61 percent in 2016. A former Delta Airlines flight attendant, McBath campaigned on health care, reproductive rights, and fair tax cuts. She didn’t focus exclusively on firearms. But McBath’s campaign made it clear that, much like Carolyn McCarthy 22 years ago, she decided to run because of the shooting death of her son. McBath wants to close loopholes in background check laws and raise the age to legally purchase weapons to 21. If Democrats are ever going to make inroads on gun policy, this is the type of district which they must flip from red to blue. However, the Senate is another enterprise altogether. There is almost no way gun control activists would make any headway whatsoever in this midterm in the Senate. Sens. Bob Casey, D-Pa., Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., and Jon Tester, D-Mont., were up in swing states where firearms are popular. They all won. But the gun issue really wasn’t central to those campaigns. Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., and Joe Donnelly, D-Ind., also stood for re-election in gun-friendly states. That trio lost. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, D-Texas, really couldn’t campaign much on guns in his race against Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. After all, it’s Texas. But a place like Texas is precisely where those pushing for gun policy changes need to win if they are ever to make changes on this issue. Other seats Democrats would need to win in order to make inroads? Utah and Wyoming featured Senate contests this year. Sen.-elect Mitt Romney, R-Utah, will succeed retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. Wyoming voters re-elected Sen. John Barassso, R-Wyo. Could gun control advocates go into either Utah and Wyoming and have a fighting chance? Doubtful. That said, Mississippi is a place where Democrats might yet have a chance in a Republican stronghold. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., faces a runoff against Democrat and former Rep. Mike Espy, D-Miss., later this month. Again, gun control really isn’t an issue in the Mississippi Senate race. And even if Espy wins the runoff, he might not exactly be the guy gun reform activists are looking fore. The NRA awarded Espy its “Silver Rifle” award more than a decade ago. Keep in mind, Democrats just don’t need to win control of the Senate in order to make up some ground on the gun issue. They need to get close to 60 votes in the Senate to have a snowball’s chance of doing anything. Sixty votes is the threshold required in the Senate to overcome a filibuster on legislation. Many on the right are now critical of Democrats for blowing their chance on guns some years ago. After the 2008 elections, Democrats wielded control of the House, boasted 60 Democratic votes in the Senate and President Obama occupied the White House. This was long before Sandy Hook, San Bernardino, Aurora, Las Vegas and Parkland. Democrats poured most of their efforts into health care reform – producing ObamaCare. Like it or not, health care reform reached a critical mass in 2009 and 2010. Unbelievably, for all the noise about firearms, maybe the gun issue hasn’t bubbled to a legislative head yet. That is apparently even the case after the 2011 shooting that wounded former Rep. Gabrielle Gifford, D-Ariz., and her aide and later Rep. Ron Barber, D-Ariz. That was followed by the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., at the congressional baseball practice last year. After Vegas and Parkland, there was a lot of chatter about the gun issue evolving ahead of this year’s midterm elections. Well, the midterms have come and gone. There is some incremental change on firearms policy in the House.

In a tweet on Saturday night, Trump questioned why Democratic lawmakers had not passed “gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate” during Barack Obama’s presidential tenure. They “didn’t want to,” Trump claimed, “and now they just talk!” Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2018 Trump’s tweet was posted hours after hundreds of gun violence survivors and activists attended a gun control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where 17 people were killed Wednesday in a shooting rampage, were also in attendance. Protesters chanted “shame on you,” in reference to lawmakers and Trump, who they said have done little to help reduce gun violence in the U.S. In a powerful speech, Emma Gonzalez, a senior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, excoriated Trump for accepting millions from the National Rifle Association. “If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and ... how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,” the 18-year-old said. “It doesn’t matter because I already know. Thirty million dollars. And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States in the one and a half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to $5,800. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?” Story continues “To every politician who is taking donations from the NRA, shame on you,” Gonzalez continued. Here’s the speech from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Emma Gonzalez at an anti-gun rally happening today in Fort Lauderdale https://t.co/CyfMnPDAvW // https://t.co/hgewZy4Cxf https://t.co/gssAmGczuH — Joshua Chavers (@JoshuaChavers) February 17, 2018 The NRA reportedly spent $11.4 million supporting Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign and almost $20 million to undermine Hillary Clinton. Trump told NRA members at a convention last year that they had a “true friend in the White House.” “To the NRA, I can proudly say I will never, ever let you down,” he said, vowing to “never, ever infringe” on the right of people to own guns.

We would probably send in the military, and many people would demand the minority demographic hold their own members accountable. Does this happen when the suspects are white men? But in fact, we don't have to wonder — we can simply look at the actions of the Trump administration. It took far less for the government to send in the military to counter brown immigrants. Despite the fact that the allegedly dangerous migrant caravan has killed no Americans, the White House literally sent thousands of troops to block them, even initially suggesting American soldiers should have the right to shoot migrants who throw rocks. Meanwhile, gun violence has killed over 12,500 people in 2018 alone. The only real response from the White House have been strongly worded “thoughts and prayers.” Imagine, for a moment, if the suspects were from a minority demographic like Muslims or immigrants. We would probably send in the military. Worse, the White House still refuses to take meaningful action on gun control and has cut funding to counter right-wing terrorism, despite the epidemic and generational impact of white supremacists. For example, at least five of the 11 victims of what is believed to be the single worst attack on American Jews in history were born before 1945 — which means they were alive during the Holocaust. The domestic terrorist who targeted them was furious about, among other things, a Jewish organization that has worked to help Muslim refugees. But the Pittsburgh attack was far from an isolated occurrence of anti-Semitic violence: In 2017, America saw nearly a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic violence over the previous year — the single largest increase in one year since 1979 when such data tracking began. “Many just see this an attack on the Jewish community,” said Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. “It's not. It was an attack on America.” Get the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha The rabbi’s wisdom is deep. In 2011, a white nationalist — not unlike the man who attacked the Tree of Life synagogue — attacked a Sikh Gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six Sikh Americans, thinking they were Muslim. In 2015, another white nationalist attacked the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine black Christians in what he described as an attempt to start a race war. In 2017, yet another white nationalist attacked a Quebec, Canada mosque, killing six Muslims during prayer. Meanwhile, in 2016, the FBI caught three white nationalists in Kansas as they plotted to bomb an apartment complex and mosque largely comprised of Somali Muslim refugees. Since the beginning of 2017, the Anti-Defamation league has tracked more than an astounding 900 incidents of white supremacist violence and propaganda incidents. Hundreds of incidents occurred on college campuses. If we think the problem is bad now, what happens in the coming years and decades when these young and impressionable minds become adults, influenced by hateful rhetoric and armed with semi-automatic weapons? Apathy, disunity, and America’s lax gun laws embolden these terrorists. Indeed, even Islamic State terrorists push their radicals to exploit America’s weak gun laws. Gun violence in America is getting so bad that survivors of other attacks are now getting killed later, in subsequent shootings. Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks, California wasn’t just any bar. Some of the survivors of the Las Vegas shooting met for solace there after the Oct. 1, 2017 attack — by a white man — that left 58 dead. Telemachus Orfanos survived that Vegas attack, and was killed in the November 8 Borderline shooting. The solution, therefore, is purposeful action, a return to morality and a focus on unity. Purposeful action mandates commonsense legislation that ensures human rights are more important than gun rights. In a shocking interview regarding the Borderline shooting, Tennessee Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn remarked, “What we do is say how do we make certain that we protect the Second Amendment."" Her focus was on gun rights over human life. Notably, the NRA contributed $1.25 million to her campaign. What Blackburn fails to understand is that commonsense reform does not mean we strip guns from law abiding citizens, it means we make it more difficult for people incapable of safe gun use from acquiring them. Sen Marsha Blackburn on Thousand Oaks: “What we do is say how do we make certain that we protect the Second Amendment."" The @NRA contributed more than $1 million to Blackburn’s winning campaign.pic.twitter.com/B6nJ7BAtfk — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) November 8, 2018 A return to morality mandates we recognize the root causes of mass violence, such as domestic violence. We know that many of the men who commit mass shootings have a history of domestic violence. The shooter in Tallahassee left a well-documented trail of misogyny behind; it is now being reported that the Borderline shooter has his own alleged history of violence against women. And, perhaps not surprisingly, it seems people intervened on his behalf to try and keep him out of trouble. Talk about white privilege. Moving forward, we must allocate more resources to educate young boys and men — and hold them accountable when they do hurt women and girls. And a focus on unity means that when one of us falls, we all help the fallen stand. In the days after the attack, the Muslim communities of Pittsburgh helped raise over $200,000 for the Tree of Life synagogue. In my ""ReSightIslam"" podcast we discuss how this is precisely in the spirit of the Qur’an 22:40-41, which commands Muslims to stand in defense of all houses of worship — including synagogues. This also means we resist outrage fatigue, a tall order as America’s 2018 mass shooting count has surpassed 300, according to organizations that track it. We must keep talking about these crucial events by remembering the victims, organizing for change and supporting leaders who push back against such violence and racism. No easy solution exists to stopping hate and extremism. There is no quick fix. However, by focusing on purposeful action, morality in countering violence against women and unity in the face of extremism, we can try to work towards a world where these attacks do not happen.",David Ian Long Ron Helus Thousand Oaks shooting Mass shooting Borderline Bar & Grill Shooting Gun control Massachusetts Murder Thousand Oaks,A memorial for the victims of the shooting in the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.,"Privilege is when, in a two-week span, white men kill 11 Jews in Pennsylvania, two black people in Kentucky grocery store, two women in a Florida yoga studio and 12 people in a California bar, yet no one calls to ban, deport, or profile white men — or asks, “Where were they radicalized?” Imagine, for a moment, if the suspects were from a minority demographic like Muslims or immigrants.

In some instances during the drill, the Public Announcement system, which Mead said dates back to the 1950s, failed. “We ended up running down hallways to shout ‘Lockdown!’” he remembered. Perhaps worse, when a human resources employee tried to make an announcement to prompt the active shooter drill, he picked up the phone and dialed the wrong code and locked himself in a room. Mead explained how a stress factor kicks in, which he leads to instances of bungled dialing or botching a critical prewritten script. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now “With him locked out, everyone is standing around wondering ‘Why isn’t our school locked down,’” he said. Mead quickly upgraded the PA system. Now, he said, if you dial “8303” at any of the Glen Lake Schools, a loud pulse blares and a prerecorded message warns faculty, students to “Lock the doors and stay away from the windows.” When Mead and his boss Glen Lake Community Schools Superintendent Sander Scott evaluated their poor marks, they decided to overhaul the entire security system. By the end of September, with the help of federal taxpayer dollars, the Glen Lake Community Schools will have Michigan’s first gunshot sensor security system. “Ever since I came to Glen Lake I've been getting formal some informal suggestions from parents grandparents, comm members about the need to beef up our security,” Superintendent Scott said in an interview with Newsweek. The tech purports to detect an armed intruder and potential spent ammunition rounds in real-time. Siemens Building Technologies won out a Request For Proposal bidding process with a bottom line estimate of $156,000. The monies made it possible to put in place the “Guardian Indoor Active Shooter Detection System” -- which its parent company website dubs it to be the “most accurate gunshot detection technology available today” and known to be able to rely on “military grade” sensors and software to pinpoint where shots are fired in a building. CEO of Shooter Detection Systems Christian Connors boasted that the system has been operational “for over 26 million hours without a single false alert” in schools, airports, manufacturing sites and other complex environments. The need for gunshot detection was inspired by national experts and even firefighters -- who Scott credits for meting out fire-related fatalities in school buildings. “You have smoke detectors that are constantly sniffing for smoke if, you will,” he said. “Now we have shot detectors which are constantly listening for a gunshot or looking for the flash of gunpowder.” Mark Wilson/Getty Images Both Mead and Scott pointed to a convergence of three specific events from last year that pushed them to radically revamp the school system’s security apparatus. On Valentine’s Day, a total of 17 students and teachers attending the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, were shot dead by a former student identified as Nikolas Cruz who was armed with an AR-15-style rifle. A month later, James Eric Davis Jr., 19, was arrested a short time after allegedly shooting his parents at his dorm room located at Western Michigan University. Days after that attack, Scott said local authorities and the school district thwarted a student at one of the schools who allegedly made “credible” threats and also had “access to an AR-15.” “I had some internal motivation, but I also had a public mandate to really dig in and do something a little more intense than what’s been done previously,” he said. Scott also notes that he’s not just trying to make the school safe with technology alone. He has put in place counselors, and an anonymous tip line as well as other psychological and emotional programs to help kids cope with what is now the new normal in compulsory learning institutions. “We’re not done,” Scott said. “We’re not seeing this as a panacea. We’re seeing this as a great next step.”""",Image  Connecticut Photography Getty Images Statue Photograph Stock photography News Half-mast,The Glen Lake Community Schools in Michigan is the first school in the country to have a system that can be used to monitor a gunman and a shooting suspect.,"""“It was like watching a trainwreck,” Marcus Mead, the district’s Director of Administration and Instructional Technology told Newsweek.

Right now,’ magazine editor declares","Esquire's editor-at-large penned a letter of sorts to the National Rifle Association and blasted the organization in the wake of the Santa Fe High School massacre in Texas. In his Friday piece for the magazine, Dave Holmes accused the NRA of having ""bought our government"" and convincing its ""members that the occasional school shooting, the odd literal slaughter of innocents, is an unfortunate but inevitable quirk of American life, a thing that is necessary to preserve freedom."" His main point? But Holmes' thesis was summed up in the following three lines: Anyway, I just wanted to drop you a line and let you know that I now actually do want to take your guns. All of your guns. Right now. 'It wasn’t always this way' ""It wasn’t always this way,"" he added in the magazine piece. ""I have responsible gun owners in my family. I’ve never been a fan of shooting at things myself, but guns sure do seem to have brought joy into the lives of some people I love, and as long as they were stored properly, I never had a problem with them being around. I believed that we should place a hurdle or two between a psychopath and an AR-15, but that’s about as ardent as I got. Live and let live, that was my policy. Even with death machines."" He continued, ""That has all changed. And you changed it."" Holmes said the NRA ""had the opportunity to work with the vast majority of Americans who support the sensible reform of our gun laws. You have had the chance to preserve your own rights as we work together to keep our gun regulations in step with gun technology. You haven’t."" He mentioned that bump-stock manufacturing could have been banned and minimum ages for gun ownership could have increased and gun-safety studies could've been done — but instead the NRA battled against such changes and took ""to our television screens to tell us that the world is an apocalyptic hellscape, and that the only way to be safe from gun violence is to stock our homes with guns."" 'The ground is shifting. Get ready' More from Holmes' piece: I was stunned and sad after Parkland. I was heartened by the efforts of the young people who watch their friends get murdered in front of them. I watched you make nice with them on CNN and then, behind their backs, call them terrorists. And then this morning I watched the same goddamn thing happen again, only this time at a high school in Santa Fe, Texas, where at least ten people are dead. As though all of the marching and organizing and common-sense talking had never happened. As though this ever growing pile of young bodies is worth nothing. So now I’m angry. Now I’m finished trying to reason with you. So now I, a guy who was ambivalent about guns just a few years ago, want to take your guns away. All of them. I want to take them all and melt them down and shape them into a giant sphere and then push it at you so you have to run away from it like Indiana Jones for the rest of your lives. I want Ted Nugent to roam the halls of his gunless house, sighing wearily until he dies. I want to end this thing once and for all, so that all of you who have prioritized the sale of guns over the lives of children have to sit quietly and think about what you’ve done. God help me, I want to take all of your guns out of your hands, by myself, right now. He concluded by saying, ""It’s happening. We tried it your way, and it really did not work.

The legislation languished under retiring Republican Gov. Dennis Daugaard, but Noem in her campaign offered support for a so-called constitutional carry law. GOP state Sen.-elect Lynne DiSanto, who as a member of the state House of Representatives sponsored a permitless concealed carry bill that Daugaard vetoed, said such legislation is likely in the upcoming session and she's optimistic about its prospects. ""There are a lot of Republicans that are very excited to have a conservative governor,"" said DiSanto. ""I think under a new governor it's very likely to pass."" ""There are a lot of Republicans that are very excited to have a conservative governor. I think under a new governor [concealed carry legislation is] very likely to pass."" — South Dakota state Sen.-elect Lynne DiSanto Daugaard has said the state's current gun laws are reasonable. Right now, it's a misdemeanor for someone to carry a concealed pistol or to have one concealed in a vehicle without a permit. At the end of October, there were nearly 108,000 pistol permits in South Dakota, according to the secretary of state's office. Daugaard vetoed DiSanto's proposal in 2017 and also rejected a similar measure in 2012; constitutional carry legislation failed during the 2018 session after he issued a veto threat. Bill supporters have argued that getting a concealed pistol permit can be burdensome. Backers are likely to get a boost from Noem, who triumphed over Democratic state Sen. Billie Sutton in the Nov. 6 election. Noem in January urged passage of a permitless carry bill. At the time Noem didn't endorse a specific plan, though her campaign said she supported the policy ""in principle."" Transition team spokeswoman Kristin Wileman said in a statement this week that Noem won't commit to legislation until she can review its text, but said she's a strong 2nd Amendment supporter and thinks provisions like constitutional carry can ""protect and even strengthen this right for South Dakotans."" ""The governor-elect will work to find a way that law enforcement and gun-right proponents can come together around a solution,"" Wileman said. Staci Ackerman, executive director of the South Dakota Sheriffs' Assn., said the group hasn't discussed 2019 legislation yet. But she said the organization supported a bill in the 2018 session that allowed permitless carry for state residents with a South Dakota driver's license or identification card; the measure didn't advance out of the Senate.

1095,372,http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/400282-nra-alleges-financial-difficulties-in-new-york-lawsuit,NRA alleges financial difficulties in New York lawsuit,"The National Rifle Association (NRA) is alleging that it is facing financial danger after the state of New York pressured financial institutions to cut ties with the gun group. The NRA claims in a lawsuit, obtained and first reported by Rolling Stone, that the state of New York sought to hurt the organization by urging financial institutions and insurers not to work with the gun group. ADVERTISEMENT The organization is suing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), the state’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) and Maria Vullo, New York’s superintendent of financial services. An amended version of the complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in New York last month. The lawsuit stems from a May decision by New York financial regulators over “Carry Guard,” an NRA-marketed insurance policy for members who face legal costs after firing a gun legally. The DFS determined that the policy was illegal under New York state law and that the insurers who provided it must stop selling the policies and pay a $7 million fine. The NRA alleges that the decision, along with ""threats"" by Cuomo, also pressured insurers to drop other policies tied to the gun group. William Brewer, an attorney for the NRA, told The Hill in an emailed statement that the gun group “is suffering setbacks with respect to the availability of insurance and banking services — as a result of a political and discriminatory campaign meant to coerce financial institutions to refrain from doing business with the NRA.” Brewer called the actions of Cuomo and the financial regulators “a blatant attack on the First Amendment rights of our organization,” adding that they “will further harm the NRA, chill the commercial activities of institutions regulated by DFS, and penalize law-abiding New York insurance consumers.” In response, Cuomo's office announced Friday afternoon that New York would be filing a motion to dismiss the NRA's lawsuit against the state, asserting that Cuomo and the state's actions were not in violation of the groups' First Amendment rights. “New York we will not be intimidated by the NRA’s frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he would be comfortable sending son, grandchildren to school in person Cafeteria worker on White House grounds tests positive for COVID-19: reports Republicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday MORE and Washington, DC may be bought and paid for by the NRA, but in New York we are listening to the voices of people across the nation calling for action to keep our communities safe. While the NRA tries to play the victim, New York stands with the real victims — the thousands of people whose lives are cut short by gun violence every year.” Cuomo has previously called the NRA's lawsuit “a futile and desperate attempt to advance its dangerous agenda to sell more guns.” The gun rights organization also states that it has lost insurance coverage after its carrier said it “was unwilling to renew coverage at any price.” The lawsuit alleges that the NRA may be forced to shut down NRATV and other publications after it lost its media liability coverage. The group claims that it could lose access to financial services because “multiple banks” are distancing themselves from the NRA “based on concerns that any involvement with the NRA — even providing the organization with basic depository services — would expose them to regulatory reprisals.” ""If the NRA is unable to collect donations from its members, safeguard the assets endowed to it, apply its funds to cover media buys and other expenses integral to its political speech, and obtain basic corporate insurance coverage, it will be unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission,"" the complaint states. The NRA cites Cuomo's past statements and actions against the NRA, claiming that for him ""weakening the political advocacy of the NRA is a career strategy."" New York officials are moving ""to coerce insurance agencies, insurers, and banks into terminating business relationships with the NRA that were necessary to the survival of the NRA as a charitable organization,"" the filing alleges. Financial issues are not new for the NRA: The group overspent by nearly $46 million in 2016, according to Rolling Stone. The group has faced intense scrutiny after several mass shootings, most notably at a Parkland, Fla., high school. Student activists from the school publicly associated the pro-gun group with lawmaker inaction on gun control. The NRA cited the backlash the organization has faced in the wake of the tragedies in the lawsuit, including a tweet from Cuomo urging businesses in New York to reconsider their ties to the group.

A New Jersey woman who reported racist, threatening messages sent to her on Facebook from a man in Kentucky may have thwarted a school shooting when she reported the posts to authorities in both states, according to officials. Kentucky State Police received a complaint from the woman on Wednesday, stating that the man -- who resides in Anderson County -- was harassing her on social media, Sgt. Josh Lawson of the Kentucky State Police public affairs division said in a press conference last week. In one of the messages, the suspect, 21-year-old Dylan Jarrell, allegedly called the woman a ""wanna be black woman"" and told her he hopes her ""black children get hung for you being so stupid,"" Koeberle Bull, the woman who reported Jarrell to authorities, told The Washington Post. Other messages allegedly read, ""There's no such thing as white privileged"" and ""please you and your monkey children go die."" Bull, who is white, reported the messages because she was worried for her three biracial children, she told The Post. While Bull's Facebook page shows her with her three children, ages 8, 11, and 16, she does not know why Jarrell targeted her, she told the newspaper. After combing through Jarrell's social media account and finding other concerning posts, police encountered him as he was backing out of his driveway Thursday afternoon and ""found evidence of a credible and imminent threat"" to the Shelby and Anderson County School districts after interviewing him, Lawson said. Officers also found a firearm, more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a Kevlar vest, a 100-round high-capacity magazine and a detailed plan of the attack in Jarrell's possession, Lawson said. Dylan Jarrell in a police booking photo. Shelby County Detention Center After executing a search warrant on Jarrell's home and electronic devices, investigators also found that he had searched ""how to successfully conduct a school shooting,"" Lawson said. Jarrell was charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications, Lawson said. He is currently being held at the Shelby County Detention Center without bond, jail records show. In May, the FBI questioned Jarrell over threats made on social media to a school in Tennessee, according to Kentucky State Police. ABC News could not immediately reach an attorney for him. Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders commended the New Jersey woman who reported the violent content of Jarrell's alleged messages and the federal and local law enforcement agencies involved for the swift investigation. ""We often hear from the community, 'Well, why should I call the police? You guys aren't gonna do anything,'"" Sanders said. ""This is an example of how, when you call the police, and we work closely together, we do something about it.""

In doing so, the musicians plan 'to honor the victims lost to gun violence and terrorism at various live music events over the course of the past year,' according to a statement. Morris, Church and the Osbornes were among the artists who performed at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, when, on Oct. 1, a gunman opened fire, killing 58 attendees and himself.

'Sadly, that wasn’t always the case this past year. We believe it’s incredibly important to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in these senseless tragedies and to remind musicians and music lovers alike that live music will continue to be a powerful force that unites us all.' This will be the first time the Grammy-nominated Brothers Osborne, who earned a nod for country duo/group performance for their song 'It Ain’t My Fault,' will play at the Grammys. For her part, Morris is nominated in the country solo performance category for 'I Could Use a Love Song.' The trio will join an expanding performance roster that will include Kendrick Lamar, Cardi B, Childish Gambino, Luis Fonsi, Khalid, Logic, Patti LuPone, Bruno Mars and SZA.

1200,124,https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/how-the-madden-community-is-responding-to-the-jacksonville-shooting.html,How the Madden community is responding to the Jacksonville shooting.,"On Sunday, a 24-year-old white man who had traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, to maybe win money by playing Madden NFL 19 instead used a handgun to shoot people he had known, professionally if not personally, for years. He killed two people, and injured nearly a dozen more, before killing himself. Video capturing the moments before the tragedy was broadcast on a Twitch livestream of the professional video game tournament, which was held at GLHF Game Bar in a Chicago Pizza. (Good Luck, Have Fun is pretty classic gamer parlance, whether used earnestly or sarcastically.) Elijah “Trueboy” Clayton, one of those killed in Jacksonville, was 22. Though he was from California, he favored the Jacksonville Jaguars and had won the 2017 NFL Club Series event with the Jags. Trueboy had played Madden and football IRL in high school, according to the Los Angeles Times. Just a few days before he traveled cross-country to compete, Trueboy posted a video to his public Instagram account in advance of the coming season. Still got work to do. A post shared by Eli Clayton (@truesowavy) on Aug 23, 2018 at 1:27am PDT “It’s impossible to comprehend today’s news. I’m heartbroken for the families and friends of the victims and can only express my deepest condolences as we try to understand why and how this can happen, not only here, but anywhere,” said Jaguars owner Shad Khan in a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday. A bio on EA Sports’ competitive page about Trueboy noted his strengths: “His versatility when it comes to playbooks and game planning is what keeps True locked-in as one of the perennial top competitors in the scene.” Trueboy had also been featured on an episode of NFL’s Madden America series with Dave Grunfeld. After he played Grunfeld, he helped the host improve his strategy for future matches. Just a few weeks before the Jacksonville tournament, Taylor “SpotMePlzzz” Robertson, 27, had announced that he was joining professional esports team Dot City Gaming for the Madden Championship Series. He was a husband and father and West Virginia Mountaineers fan who, like Trueboy Clayton, had played football in high school. SpotMe was also winner of the Madden 17 Classic and was known for his offensive plays. His EA Sports bio for the Madden 18 season, in which he played the Tennessee Titans, says he “has the skill to completely take over any Madden tournament.” Here is Robertson playing the Titans on an episode of Madden America with Grunfeld: Just the night before Trueboy and SpotMe died, I was debating with a family member about whether video games cause violence—and whether games, in general, were dangerous. Even in the wake of this horror, which touched a community I’m adjacent to and feel deep sympathy for, I still don’t think they are, or that they make a person violent. Nearly every game I’ve played or replayed in 2018 has involved guns. I’ve used a gun to summon or stun demon Pokémon. I’ve used the light bowgun to capture, not kill, Rathalos or to fend off Sentinels and biological horrors. Every night when I sign off from work, one of the first things I consider is whether I want to engage in several hours of cartoonish gunplay via Overwatch or Fortnite, or if I’d just prefer the casual gunplay in Persona 5. I even dabbled in a shoot-’em-up title where I was the gun. Not one of the games I’ve touched in recent years has involved military-style combat or excessive gore. But many of them had guns. And many of them involved using those guns on fictional representations of people. In games, skill, tact, and personality transcend the restrictions of real-life relationships that insecurity and social norms could otherwise hinder. In the aftermath of so many shootings, we’ve discussed the violence in video games. None of the Madden games involve shooting a gun. At its core, the franchise has always been simple: Make a football team. Play the football team. Beat the other football team. (Variety’s Will Partin does a much better job explaining what the past weekend’s tournament series entailed, and how it ties in to Madden’s pro scene at large.) And I’m setting aside the argument about whether football is dangerous because it’s a useless whataboutism in the aftermath. Madden is not about guns, or about killing people, or about fighting terrorists or living out comically dangerous murder fantasies. It is Football: The Video Game. While the stereotype may be that video game players are loners who avoid social interaction, that is far from the reality for many of us. In Madden, as in other games, most pro players know one another. They vouch for each other in the online spaces where players congregate, drum up engagement or hype with fans through offseason matches and one-off tournaments, or make low-key verbal wagers on one another’s success or failure. Even from a distance, it is clear that this collection of (mostly, but not exclusively) young men has formed a kind of family, one that can only be forged through games—where your skill, tact, and personality transcend the restrictions of real-life relationships that insecurity and social norms could otherwise hinder. A long time ago, I found my own game family. We came together by chance in a fantasy roleplaying game (that has guns) as we slowly worked toward in-game goals and triumphs. And once we were in-game comrades, we gradually worked our way into one another’s lives as we individually, but collaboratively, grew and changed. Now we travel together semiannually, talk constantly, and play games together often. The idea that any of us could die doing the one thing we all love, on an occasion when we’d all traveled to be together? I don’t have the words for it. I try, but my throat stops up and I get a little teary-eyed and then I pop into Discord just to make sure they’re all OK, that they’re all still there. I’m not sure when I’ll stop doing that. It’s impossible to say what the murderer was thinking, or what may have motivated him to open fire, but he was known for being very removed from Madden’s more social aspects. It has been reported that his family struggled for years to get him effective mental health care and that he legally acquired two handguns before he left for Florida. In an interview in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Dennis “Evil Ken” Alston, a Madden pro scene mainstay, said that the gunman was a “well-known competitor” who did not play against either Clayton or Robertson during the tournament. Contrary to virulent online rumors that they had been targeted over a loss, he instead lost two matches to another player and Alston himself. He was weird all weekend. He had shades on, he didn’t speak to anybody—even after we played, I beat him and went to shake his hand and tell him good game and he just looked at me, he wouldn’t say anything. … He had on basically the same outfit he had on the day before, so that was kind of weird. Alston, who plays under the username “DoT Tamales,” and Reggie “BoogzTuff” Brown did both play, and defeat, a player with the username “satiricbulb” during the group stage and single one-on-one matches, respectively, over the weekend. While the shooter’s name was on the list of players registered for the weekend tournament, the username is not one that has been publicly linked to him. He had previously used a host of monikers over the years including “Bread,” “mr_sliced_bread,” “RavensChamp,” “raua4848,” “TREXHARTATAK,” and “DatWazRuffDog.” Authorities are continuing the investigation into the shooter’s motive. Madden player Justin “Swizzy” Saline has started a $100,000 GoFundMe campaign specifically for the families of Trueboy and SpotMe that had raised over $26,000 by early Tuesday afternoon. A second GoFundMe page endorsed by GLHF Game Bar on Twitter has been posted “to cover funeral costs, medical costs, counselling and other costs incurred from this horrendous tragedy.” As of Tuesday, it had raised more than $20,000 of its $250,000 target goal. Developing a friendship over online gaming—knowing some of the deepest, most private thoughts of people you never or rarely see face to face—can be complex. But the interpersonal web woven with HDMI and Ethernet cables has formed some of the strongest bonds in my life. And as members of the Madden community grieve for their lost and rally behind their injured, I find love in them.",Jacksonville Landing shooting Video Games  Madden NFL 19 Jacksonville Game Esports 2018 Deadly force Shooting,"A memorial to the victims of the shooting at the Jacksonville County Courthouse in Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday.","On Sunday, a 24-year-old white man who had traveled to Jacksonville, Florida, to maybe win money by playing Madden NFL 19 instead used a handgun to shoot people he had known, professionally if not personally, for years.

108,364,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-3d-guns-ruling-20180827-story.html,Judge blocks Texas company from putting plans to make 3D guns online,"A U.S. judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration Monday from allowing a Texas company to post online plans for making untraceable 3D guns, agreeing with 19 states and the District of Columbia that such access to the plastic guns would pose a security risk. The states sued to stop an agreement that the government had reached with Austin, Texas-based Defense Distributed, saying guidelines on how to print undetectable plastic guns could be acquired by felons or terrorists. U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik extended a temporary restraining order, and his new decision will last until the case is resolved. He said Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed, wanted to post the plans online so that citizens can arm themselves without having to deal with licenses, serial numbers and registrations. Wilson has said that ""governments should live in fear of their citizenry."" ""It is the untraceable and undetectable nature of these small firearms that poses a unique danger,"" Lasnik said. ""Promising to detect the undetectable while at the same time removing a significant regulatory hurdle to the proliferation of these weapons — both domestically and internationally — rings hollow and in no way ameliorates, much less avoids, the harms that are likely to befall the states if an injunction is not issued."" The State Department had reached the settlement with the company after the agency removed the 3D gun-making plans from a list of weapons or technical data that cannot be exported overseas. The states argued that the federal agency didn't follow the law when it removed 3D guns from the munitions list. They said the government was supposed to notify Congress and provide a 30-day window before making a change to that list, but it did not. Lasnik criticized the government for switching its position on the threat posed by the 3D gun-making plans. Up until April, the government argued the distribution of the guidelines ""posed a threat to world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States,"" the judge said. Despite those fears, the government decided that it only needed to restrict the international availability of firearms up to .50 caliber. That's when they reached a settlement with the 3D gun company. There was no indication the government evaluated the unique characteristics of the plastic guns when it considered deleting that category of weapons from the prohibited list, the judge said. ""Nor is there any reasoned explanation for its change in position,"" Lasnik said. The federal government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the judge's ruling. A lawyer with the U.S. Justice Department had argued against the injunction, saying possessing 3D plastic guns is already against the law, and the federal government is committed to enforcing that law. But the judge said it wasn't enough. ""While the court appreciates the earnestness with which this commitment was made at oral argument, it is of small comfort to know that, once an undetectable firearm has been used to kill a citizen of Delaware or Rhode Island or Vermont, the federal government will seek to prosecute a weapons charge in federal court while the state pursues a murder conviction in state court,"" Lasnik said. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson praised the ruling. ""Once again, I'm glad we put a stop to this dangerous policy,"" Ferguson said. ""But I have to ask a simple question: why is the Trump administration working so hard to allow these untraceable, undetectable 3D-printed guns to be available to domestic abusers, felons and terrorists?"" The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun control group that has aggressively fought the online release of the gun plans, praised the judge's ruling ""as a tremendous victory for the American public."" Avery Gardiner, co-president of the group, said 3D-printed guns ""represent a supreme threat to our safety and security, and we are grateful that Judge Lasnik recognized it as such.""

Authorities said his ability to fire hundreds of rounds per minute over the course of 10 minutes from his perch in a 32nd-floor hotel suite was a major factor in the high casualty count. While machine guns are outlawed in the United States, bump stocks are not. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in March the Justice Department was proposing a rule that would effectively ban the devices. In February, Trump had signed a memorandum directing the department to make the regulatory change. The change required a public comment period before taking effect.

No further details were provided. ADVERTISEMENT High school students have been some of the most vocal advocates for new gun laws in response to last Wednesday’s shooting, which left 17 students and staff dead. Emma Gonzalez, a student from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the shooting took place, called out Trump during an impassioned speech at a pro-gun control rally Saturday in Fort Lauderdale, roughly 40 miles from where the president is spending the holiday weekend. “If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should never have happened, and maintain telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,” Gonzalez said. “I already know — $30 million.” Trump visited injured victims and their families on Friday at a nearby hospital and also met with first responders and law enforcement officers to thank them, but he made no mention of new gun laws during his visit. The president criticized former President Obama and Democrats for not tightening the nation’s gun laws when they were in power. “Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration.

330,10685,https://us.cnn.com/2018/03/12/politics/donald-trump-guns-plan-immigration-parkland/index.html,Trump not so tough on guns,"(CNN) Donald Trump billed himself as a leader of bravura and defiance armed with supernatural political skills that could rewrite the script of crippled Washington. ""Nobody knows the system better than me, which is why I alone can fix it,"" Trump famously said in accepting the GOP nomination in 2016. Yet that fearlessness was missing in action Monday when the White House blamed the deadlock of that same system for the paucity of his ambition as it rolled out its response to the Florida high school massacre. ""The President as you know doesn't have the ability to create federal law,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said, offering a lesson in the Constitution for reporters and insisting the President was not backing away from more significant steps. ""You can't just decide that you want laws to pass and it happens,"" Sanders said, arguing that there was simply not sufficient support in the Republican-led Congress for significant gun control measures. In effect, Sanders was arguing that Trump wanted to do more, but can't. Yet just a few weeks ago, at a staggering televised meeting at the White House, Trump mocked Republican senators for being scared of the National Rifle Association, passionately pushed his plan to raise the legal age requirement for buying long guns, and suggested a big, comprehensive guns bill. He even seemed open talking about a Democratic push for an assault weapons ban and said police should be able to take away guns from mentally ill people even without due process, causing his GOP colleagues to blanch. ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified,"" Trump said, before telling his flabbergasted guests: ""I'd rather have you come down on the strong side instead of the weak side."" It now appears that meeting was just for show. For one thing, none of the measures that Trump proposed on Monday are strongly opposed by the NRA. The new Trump plan calls for training teachers to carry firearms, modest fixes to the background check system, and reforms of mental health care. But he kicked his call to raise the age requirement for certain firearms to 21 into the long grass of a commission chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, despite decrying such panels on Saturday as just ""talk, talk, talk."" Sanders rejected the idea that Trump's plan was modest, meek and hardly the bold action of a man who had vowed to be a leader like no other. ""You guys continue to misunderstand and misrepresent the comments that I'm making,"" Sanders complained to reporters, before offering a remarkably orthodox Washington explanation of the actions of a president who is usually prides himself on rejecting the tropes of establishment politics. ""I'm saying that the President is pushing forward on things that we know have broad-based support and that we can immediately get done, while, at the same time, we're looking at the best way forward to push these other things through,"" Sanders said. When she was challenged on the fact that a majority of the public supports Trump's proposal on raising age requirements, Sanders sniffed at opinion surveys and metaphorically threw up her hands. ""He's talking about Congress, who actually has the ability to make law, not online polls,"" she said. It was significant, however, that the gun announcements were made in a press release on Sunday night and relayed at the press secretary's briefing and did not merit the heft of a personal presidential appearance that is standard for major policy proposals. In some ways, Sanders was making a valid political point. Given Republican majorities in Congress and the midterm election sensitivities of Senate Democrats running in red states, the time is hardly ripe for a major gun bill -- or a less ambitious one that would tinker with age requirements. But she also implicitly offered the answer to the question that has hung in the air ever since the extraordinary outpouring of emotion and activism by surviving students of the massacre : Would the President wager a little of the political capital he enjoys with his political base to give cover to Republican lawmakers who worry about tough votes on gun control? Taking the heat The limited scope of the Trump school safety plan and the President's unwillingness to challenge the difficult math in Congress also undercut his complaints that he was far better at shaking congressional paralysis than his predecessors. ""You went through a lot of Presidents and you didn't get it done. You have a different President,"" Trump said in his meeting with lawmakers. ""It's time that a President stepped up, and we haven't had them."" The gap between expectations and delivery on the guns meeting mirrored another surreal reality show style-even t that the President staged on immigration, when he came close to proposing the kind of ""comprehensive"" immigration bill that would outrage the conservative grass roots. ""I'll take the heat, I don't care,"" Trump said. But the evidence since both meetings suggests that far from sticking his neck out to pass legislation that requires him to put some political skin in the game, his first reaction when faced with a political roadblock is to step back. After all, major legislation that has passed during his presidency -- like tax reform for instance -- was largely driven from inside Congress, with the President offering support but not dictating the shape of proposed laws. The President who shocked the world by being willing to meet North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, and by demanding tariffs against US allies, doesn't seem to have the same zeal when it comes to arguing and issue that risks angering his own grass roots supporters. That might make Washington more skeptical of the freewheeling, unscripted headline grabbing reality-show style television spectaculars that Trump seems to relish -- but have now twice been proven not to shape policy.",Donald Trump Dianne Feinstein Democratic Party Republican Party The White House United States Senate Politics Gun control President of the United States United States Department of Justice,President Trump speaking to reporters on Monday at the White House.,"(CNN) Donald Trump billed himself as a leader of bravura and defiance armed with supernatural political skills that could rewrite the script of crippled Washington.

674,110337,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/gun-control-mental-health-care-debate-mass-shootings/story?id=59294750,Gun control vs. mental health care: debate after mass shootings obscures murky reality,"Gun control vs. mental health care: debate after mass shootings obscures murky reality Experts say that blaming the violence on the mentally ill is inaccurate. This story is from Kaiser Health News After the recent mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., in which 11 people were killed at a country music bar, President Donald Trump struck a familiar refrain: “It’s a mental health problem,” he said of the gunman, Ian David Long. “He was a very sick puppy.” Similarly, after a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 students and staff members in February, Trump tweeted that there were “so many signs that the shooter was mentally disturbed.” Public health and mental health experts counter that blaming the violence on the mentally ill is unfair and inaccurate, pointing instead to lax gun laws. “Most violence is not committed by people who are mentally ill,” said Dr. Renée Binder, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California-San Francisco and a past president of the American Psychiatric Association. “Even if you took everyone who had any kind of mental illness and locked them up and gave them meds, it would hardly make a dent on the problem of violence.” Post-shooting debates typically are painted in black and white — but research suggests that the truth is less clear-cut. The “stigma-busting advocates,” who insist that mental illness has no connection to violence, and the “fearmongers,” who assert that “the mentally ill are a dangerous menace and should be locked up,” are both wrong, said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University who has studied patterns of violence in major U.S. cities. While it is true that mental illness plays only a small role in most forms of violence, including individual homicides, its role is larger in mass shootings. About 60 percent of mass shooters have a history of serious mental disorders and two-thirds had never been seen by a mental health professional, said Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, who has spent years studying mass public shootings. While that suggests a greater need for treatment, the one-third who did get help “carried out an attack anyway,” he said. “So, even getting mental health care is not the panacea people make it out to be.” For instance, James Holmes, who killed 12 people in an Aurora, Colo., theater in 2012, had been treated by a psychiatrist and spoken of homicidal thoughts. But he was not reported to authorities because he voiced no concrete plan. Seung-Hui Cho, whose mental problems dated to childhood, repeatedly talked to campus counselors two years before he killed 32 people and wounded 17 others at Virginia Tech University in 2007. Diagnosed with a mood disorder after threatening to harm himself in 2005, he was hospitalized overnight and ordered by a judge to receive outpatient treatment. But, mysteriously, he was not assessed or treated. Often, shooters’ propensity for violence is easier to see in hindsight. Six months before the shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, police responded to a 911 call about yelling and banging coming from inside the house where Long, the alleged shooter, was living with his mother. They found an “irate” young man acting “irrationally” and called in a mental health crisis team. The social workers on that team evaluated and concluded there were no grounds to place him under a psychiatric hold. It is unclear whether the officers were told of his history as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, which after the shooting led to speculation he might have had post-traumatic stress disorder. Only later did it emerge that Long had allegedly assaulted a track coach in high school. California allows authorities to place people on a 72-hour hold to evaluate their mental states — a practice similar to that in many states. But the standard for such holds, known in California as a “5150,” is quite high, said Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency physician who heads the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center at UC-Davis. To be held, a person must pose a serious imminent threat to themselves or others or be so gravely disabled that they can’t take care of themselves, he said. The law does not take substance abuse into account, Wintemute said. “A 5150 involves taking a person into custody sometimes against their will,” Wintemute said. “That’s not something that’s done lightly.” Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, the psychiatrist who founded the Treatment Advocacy Center 20 years ago, long has argued that society needs to be more forceful in getting care for the severely disturbed — and requiring it when necessary — to prevent suicide, mass shootings and other violence. His goal is to get more state legislatures to pass bills like Kendra’s Law in New York and Laura’s Law in California that allow judges to order mentally ill people into outpatient treatment. His organization helped draft both those bills and has helped win passage of similar laws in at least 16 states. In California and some other states, however, the reach of the law is limited by whether counties decide to implement the approach. Duwe takes no position on the idea of mandated treatment but said that doing so to prevent events that happen only a few times a year makes little sense. “Mass public shootings are more commonplace than they ought to be, but they are still too infrequent to design policies based on addressing such rare events,” he said. Gun laws that exclusively target people with mental health histories also make little sense, said Drs. James Knoll and George Annas, psychiatry professors at SUNY Upstate Medical Center, in a 2016 article in Psychiatry Online. They “will be extremely low yield, ineffective, and wasteful of scarce resources,” they wrote. Wintemute argued that other strategic interventions may work better. He advocates fixing problems in the nationwide system of background checks, which requires firearm dealers to verify with the FBI that a purchaser isn’t a felon, fugitive, domestic abuser or dangerously mentally ill. He said flaws in the law include the fact that private sales, including those at gun shows, are exempt; only federal, but not state, agencies are required to submit data to the background-check database; and thousands of cases of violence by military service members — including that of a shooter who killed 26 people in a Texas church in 2017 — are not reported. Wintemute also helped draft a California law that took effect in 2016 that allows family members or law enforcement officials to seek a temporary restraining order barring a potentially violent person from purchasing guns and removing any already in their possession. These so-called gun violence restraining orders don’t involve a mental health assessment, Wintemute said, but are designed to let family members temporarily get guns away from a relative at risk of doing harm, including suicides. The order can last up to three weeks and can be extended for up to a year after a hearing, in which the gun owner can ask a judge to return the weapon. In California, 190 orders were issued through the end of last year, Wintemute said, results he described as disappointing. Numbers for this year have not yet been compiled, but Wintemute said they are growing. So far, 13 states have passed similar laws, beginning with Connecticut in 1999. Eight, including Florida, approved them in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, and Florida has already issued 450 such orders, Wintemute said. Physicians can play a key role by asking patients and family members if they own guns and encouraging the family to seek a gun order if they’re worried, Wintemute added. “If physicians are willing to see this as ‘If you see something, say something,’ and bring it to families’ attention, we could decrease rates of suicide and possibly mass shootings,” he said.

The NRA and its lobbying arm spent $30 million in the 2016 election to support Trump. A spokesman for the gun rights group declined to comment to Politico about the FEC probe.

While the FEC declined to confirm to Politico that it had opened a preliminary probe, it reportedly sent confirmation to ADLF treasurer Brad Woodhouse. In its current stage, the investigation will likely require the NRA to provide the FEC with its campaign finance records from 2016 onwards.

18,10693,https://www.yahoo.com/news/wanted-shooting-suspect-forcibly-committed-2016-033336896.html,Some wanted shooting suspect forcibly committed in 2016,"MIAMI (AP) -- Documents show some officials were so concerned about the mental stability of the student accused of last month's Florida high school rampage that they decided he should be forcibly committed. But the recommendation was never acted upon. Cruz is accused of the shooting rampage that killed 14 students and three school employees at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14. In addition, 17 people were wounded. A commitment under the law would have made it more difficult if not impossible for Nikolas Cruz to obtain a gun legally. The documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz, which were obtained by The Associated Press, show school officials and a sheriff's deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation. The documents are part of Cruz's criminal case in the shooting. They also show that he had written the word ""kill"" in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up. Calls had even been made to the FBI about the possibility of Cruz using a gun at school. The documents were provided by a psychological assessment service initiated by Cruz's mother called Henderson Behavioral Health. The documents show a high school resource officer who was also a sheriff's deputy and two school counselors recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be committed for mental evaluation under Florida's Baker Act. That law allows for involuntary commitment for mental health examination for at least three days. Such an involuntary commitment would also have been a high obstacle if not a complete barrier to legally obtaining a firearm, such as the AR-15 type rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre on Feb. 14, authorities say. There is no evidence Cruz was ever committed. Coincidentally, the school resource officer who recommended that Cruz be ""Baker Acted"" was Scot Peterson — the same Broward Sheriff's Office deputy who resigned amid accusations he failed to respond to the shooting by staying outside the building where the killings occurred. Story continues David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said that an involuntary commitment would have been a huge red flag had Cruz attempted to buy a firearm legally. ""If he had lied, hopefully the verification of the form would have pulled up the commitment paperwork,"" Weinstein said. The documents do not say why Cruz was not committed under the Baker Act or whether he may not have qualified for other reasons. The law allows a law enforcement officer such as Peterson to initiate commitment under the Baker Act. An attorney for Peterson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Sunday. Cruz, 19, is charged in a 34-count indictment with killing 17 people and wounding 17 others in the attack. He faces the death penalty if convicted, but his public defender Melisa McNeill has said he would plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence. In the Henderson Behavioral Health documents, Cruz's mother Lynda is quoted as saying she had fresh concerns about her son's mental state after he punched holes in a wall at their home in Parkland. The clinicians at Henderson came to the home for interviews and said Cruz admitted punching the wall but said he did so because he was upset at a breakup with his girlfriend. Cruz also admitted cutting his arm with a pencil sharpener. After a Sept. 28, 2016 interview, the documents say Cruz ""reports that he cut his arms 3-4 weeks ago and states that this is the only time he has ever cut. (Cruz) states that he cut because he was lonely, states that he had broken up with his girlfriend and reports that his grades had fallen. (Cruz) states that he is better now, reports that he is no longer lonely and states that his grades have gone back up."" He also told the clinician he owned only a pellet gun and was not capable of doing ""serious harm"" to anyone. The documents show that Cruz was very much on the radar screen of mental health professionals and the Broward County school system, yet very little appears to have been done other than these evaluations. Other red flags have also surfaced, including calls to the FBI about Cruz's potential to become a school shooter and numerous visits by county law enforcement officials to his home - both before his mother died in November and after, when he lived briefly with a family friend in Palm Beach County. Again, very little was done. It's not clear from the documents who the recommendation was forwarded to or why it was not followed up. ___ Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt",Stoneman Douglas High School shooting  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School School shooting 2018 United States gun violence protests Shooting Student Gun Gun violence Gun control,"A student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14, the day after a gunman killed 14 students and a school employees.",MIAMI (AP) -- Documents show some officials were so concerned about the mental stability of the student accused of last month's Florida high school rampage that they decided he should be forcibly committed.

Reflecting upon the myriad of school shootings that have taken place over the past several years, Gonzalez couldn’t hide her raw emotions as she shared her own experiences with the effects of gun violence, before calling upon audience members to use their public platforms to take a stand for gun regulation. Eight months after surviving the school shooting, Gonzalez said she can still feel the pain she experienced that day as if it’s happening right now. “Nothing made sense in those days except for the fact that there was nothing to stop this from happening to anyone in a country with practically no gun safety laws,” she said. Soon after, Gonzalez became a representative for the March for Our Lives organization, fighting for gun control legislation across America — a battle that Gonzalez said left her and her friends feeling “as though we are holding the country on our still-developing shoulders.” Gonzalez also highlighted the presence of gun violence outside of the school environment, pointing to the numerous shootings at nightclubs, concerts, airports, and more. “Gun violence isn’t picky,” Gonzalez said. Gonzalez went on to express gratitude that the voices of young people are finally being heard. “Before our voices were scoffed at and talked over. Now I’m an 18-year-old girl who’s here today,” Gonzalez said to claps from the audience. However, she also recognized that the people in the audience had the power to carry their voices further. Gonzalez listed off the numerous victims of gun violence she met during her 64-day tour across America, including the victims of the Las Vegas and Charlottesville shootings, whose stories brought her to tears as she spoke. Gonzalez then discussed some of the misconceptions surrounding March for Our Lives, making it clear that the organization is not trying to take away guns, before calling on audience members to use their own platforms to encourage more people to vote. Story continues “Everybody in this room is in a unique position, because you are here, you have proven to hold power,” Gonzalez said. “To each of you powerful women I say this, you know that you are forces to be reckoned with, you can and have inspired peace and understanding and, most importantly, right now you can inspire your audience to vote. Now more than ever women need to continue to rise up.” Related stories Tiffany Haddish Accepts Variety Power of Women Honor: 'I'm Not Sorry' I'm So Honest Regina King Celebrates the 'All-Inclusive Sisterhood That's Happening Right Now' George Clooney Warns Against Fear, Hatred From Trump Administration in Stirring Power of Women Speech Subscribe to Variety Newsletters and Email Alerts!",Emma Gonzalez Violin  Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Musician 2018 Viola Cello,"Emma Gonzalez, who was a member of March for Our Lives, spoke at the March for Our Lives event.","Emma Gonzalez was brought to tears during her speech at Variety’s Power of Women event, presented by Lifetime.

ADVERTISEMENT “We will fight this unlawful proposal to spend taxpayer dollars on guns for our kids’ classrooms every step of the way,” he added. The plan to allow states to allocate federal funding for firearms, which was reported earlier this week, would break a longstanding federal government precedent of not paying for weapons in schools. “We knew Betsy DeVos wanted to gut and privatize public education, but her decision to consider turning the federal government into an arms dealer for schools goes far beyond the recklessness we thought she was capable of. Flooding schools with guns will make kids and teachers less, not more, safe,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said. “Secretary DeVos’s proposal is not only flatly absurd, but is likely illegal.

The accused shooter was identified as 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school, who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons. Cruz allegedly carried out the shooting with an AR-15, an assault-style rifle that, according to law enforcement, he had purchased legally from a dealer in nearby Coral Springs roughly a year ago. The attack reignited a national debate over gun control and access to assault-style weapons. Stoneman Douglas students have emerged as some of the most vocal advocates of tighter gun restrictions. The protest at the Capitol on Wednesday is one among several student demonstrations calling for new gun control laws.

Then Pittsburgh Donald Trump speaks at the Future Farmers of America convention in Indianapolis. Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images More After a gunman killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue, Donald Trump condemned the attack and expressed shock at “unimaginable” violence against Jewish people. “This was an antisemitic act,” said the president, whose daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner are Jewish. “You wouldn’t think this would be possible in this day and age, but we just don’t seem to learn from the past.” The president’s words were well received but his comments about whether the attack could have been prevented and his decision to proceed with scheduled political events on Saturday did not go down as well. Adam Schiff, a Democratic congressman from California, told CNN’s State of the Union: “The problem is not how he’s handling the aftermath, although I certainly don’t agree with his suggestion that this could have been avoided or mitigated if they’d had someone armed in the synagogue. That’s not the answer. “The broader issue is what kind of climate are we creating in the country.” The Pittsburgh attack came a day after a man in Florida was arrested and charged with mailing bombs to more than a dozen of the president’s prominent critics, and three days after a gunman in Kentucky tried and failed to get inside a black church, then killed two black shoppers in a nearby grocery store. A witness told a local newspaper the gunman told him: “Whites don’t shoot whites.” The tone that he sets is one of division, often one of hatred, sometimes one of incitement of violence Adam Schiff Schiff, who is Jewish, said Trump’s public remarks, appearances at rallies and use of Twitter meant “the tone that he sets is one of division, often one of hatred, sometimes one of incitement of violence against journalists. There’s no escaping the tone that he sets for the country.” Later on Sunday, Trump duly used Twitter to call the billionaire Tom Steyer, who campaigns for Trump’s impeachment, “a crazed and stumbling lunatic”. On Saturday, Trump’s response to the attack evolved throughout the day. He tweeted, spoke to reporters and included prefaced remarks to an event in Indiana with a pre-written statement. The president said he would not cancel a planned rally in Illinois because “you can’t let these evil people change your life, change your schedules, change anything”. He also said his choice to continue was inspired by the reopening of the New York stock exchange after the September 11 terrorist attacks, which he said repeatedly happened the day after the attacks. In fact, it did not. In his address to a meeting of young farmers in Indianapolis, Trump joked about perhaps cancelling events because he was having a bad hair day – not because of the Pittsburgh attack. In a brief conversation with reporters after he landed in Murphysboro, Illinois, Trump said he would “have a very much different tone tonight”. At the rally, he duly joked about the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren and listened as the crowd greeted mention of Hillary Clinton with a chant of: “Lock her up!” “Honestly,” Schiff said on Sunday, “I think this president’s whole modus operandi is to divide us. He gets up in the morning with new and inventive ways to divide us. It’s not enough that on the day of a tragedy he says the right words if every other day of the year he’s saying things to bring us into conflict with each other.” The Anti-Defamation League said the Pittsburgh shooting was probably the “deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States”. On Sunday its chief executive, Jonathan Greenblatt, told NBC’s Meet the Press that Trump had been wrong to say the attack should not have been thought possible. “We are living in a moment where antisemitism is almost becoming normalized,” Greenblatt said. “And that should shock and move all of us to act.” The Pittsburgh attack came 14 months after white supremacists marched through Charlottesville, Virginia, carrying torches and chanting “Jews will not replace us”.

A business dispute over the release of doves at a funeral has led to a California man's arrest on suspicion of making criminal threats and the seizure of more than 50 guns and Nazi paraphernalia from his home, authorities said. Mitchell Todd, 51, was arrested at his home in Huntington Beach after he allegedly threatened a man who hired him to release white doves at his son's funeral, Sgt. Jim Cota of the Laguna Beach Police Department told ABC News on Wednesday. In a voicemail to the victim, Todd allegedly said, ""I think it's time for you to go where your son went,"" according to Cota. When police officers executed a search warrant on Todd's home on Tuesday, they seized more than 50 guns, numerous rounds of ammunition, flags bearing the Nazi swastika, a Confederate flag and a picture of Adolf Hitler, Cota said. Weapons cache seized at a home in Laguna Beach, Calif., Nov. 27, 2018. Laguna Beach Police Department Detectives also found more than 200 doves at Todd's home that were being cared for by a relative.

A sweeping tax bill with the fuel exemption stripped out by the Republicans passed the GOP-controlled House and Senate by wide margins, just days after Delta reacted to the school massacre in Florida by announcing it would no longer offer discount fares to NRA members. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal criticized the Delta controversy as an ""unbecoming squabble"" but said he would sign the broader tax measure in whatever form it passed. Delta, which is based in Atlanta and has 33,000 employees in Georgia, would have been the prime beneficiary of the tax break, estimated to be worth at least $38 million a year to airlines. The political battle at the Georgia Capitol was the latest in the debate over gun control and school safety that flared after the Feb. 14 shooting rampage in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 students and educators dead. Delta did not immediately return messages seeking comment. NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen had no immediate comment. The state Senate's presiding officer, Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, set up the showdown between gun-rights supporters and one of Georgia's biggest private employers when he vowed Monday to stop any tax break that would benefit Delta. ""Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,"" he tweeted. The dispute stirred fears of damage to Georgia's business-friendly reputation, and politicians in several other states seized on the furor in recent days, urging Delta to move its headquarters. ""Hey @delta — Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You're welcome here any time,"" Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, tweeted. The Delta provision barely came up Thursday in either legislative chamber during debate on the underlying tax bill, designed in part to give back to Georgia taxpayers $5.2 billion in extra state revenue expected over the next five years because of the recent federal tax overhaul. Story continues Cagle took a softer tone in celebrating victory Thursday. ""Obviously the political environment does sometimes get a little testy, but in the end, it's all about the product,"" said Cagle, who is running this year to succeed the term-limited governor. ""And the product we have today is something that all of us can be very proud of."" The Senate passed the tax measure 44-10, with Democrats accounting for all of the no votes. The House — which had passed an earlier version with the jet fuel exemption intact before the Delta-NRA controversy erupted — followed with a 135-24 vote. ""It's been strenuous,"" said GOP Sen. Michael Williams, another candidate for governor. ""We've been attacked by the media, we've been attacked by the left. Big corporate has gone after us. And we've stayed strong. We've even stayed strong against our own governor."" House Speaker David Ralston, a Republican, bemoaned the combative tone some had taken toward Delta. But he put some of the blame on the airline, noting the jet fuel exemption wasn't controversial before Delta crossed the NRA. ""I hope they are better at flying airplanes than timing P.R. announcements,"" Ralston said. Among Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift action on guns after the Florida tragedy. She said Delta's decision to end its NRA discounts led her to support the jet fuel tax break. ""The small steps that Delta and Dick's Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,"" Williams said. ""We're the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing."" Dick's Sporting Goods has said it will no longer sell assault-style weapons like the one used in the Florida attack. Critics of the GOP effort to retaliate against Delta have warned it could backfire by harming Georgia's ability to lure businesses — including Amazon, which recently named Atlanta a finalist in its search for a second headquarters. ""It definitely could have an effect when an outside company looks at something that happens this quickly around election time to one of the largest employers in the state,"" said William Hatcher, a professor at Augusta University who studies economic development. ""But will it be the dominant factor? I don't think so."" Delta has helped make Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport the busiest airport in the world.

What's going on? For the first time in at least 20 years, Reuters reported, the anti-gun crowd has outspent pro-gun advocates for federal races. The most recent FEC filings for the midterms reveal that gun control advocates have outspent pro-Second Amendment groups by more than 40 percent. The data show that gun control groups have shelled out $20.2 million, which dwarfs the $14.1 million spent by pro-gun groups. Liberal billionaire, rabid anti-gun activist, and possible 2020 presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is leading the charge, according to Reuters. Bloomberg is the sugar daddy behind many anti-gun causes, including Everytown for Gun Safety, which has spent $3.6 million on the 2018 federal election. According to Reuters, the rest of the group's $20 million budget has been spent on state races. The anti-gun group Giffords, which was founded by shooting survivor and former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords during the 2014 election cycle, has spent $16.3 million so far for the 2018 midterms, FEC records show. Pro-gun spending could still catch up, Reuters noted. The NRA has provided about 85 percent of the spending so far, with much of the money backing Republicans. As of the most recent FEC report, the NRA's Political Victory Fund still had $8.9 million on hand. What's the history? As Reuters noted, for at least the last 20 years, pro-gun organizations have far outspent gun control groups in federal elections. In 2016, pro-gun groups spent $73.25 million, compared to $180,000 by anti-gun groups. Here's how the spending has compared since the 1998 federal election cycles, according to Reuters: 2018 (so far) ● Gun control groups: $20.2 million ● Gun rights groups: $14.1 million 2016 ● Gun control groups: $180,000 ● Gun rights groups: $73.25 million 2014 ● Gun control groups: $340,000 ● Gun rights groups: $54.8 million 2012 ● Gun control groups: $180,000 ● Gun rights groups: $26.15 million 2010 ● Gun control groups: $10,000 ● Gun rights groups: $16.06 million 2008 ● Gun control groups: $250,000 ● Gun rights groups: $17.87 million 2006 ● Gun control groups: $80,000 ● Gun rights groups: $11.95 million 2004 ● Gun control groups: $170,000 ● Gun rights groups: $14.39 million 2002 ● Gun control groups: $260,000 ● Gun rights groups: $11.85 million 2000 ● Gun control groups: $1.66 million ● Gun rights groups: $19.35 million 1998 ● Gun control groups: $180,000 ● Gun rights groups: $9.25 million",2018 United States gun violence protests Stoneman Douglas High School shooting March for Our Lives Gun control Firearm Gun violence Brady Campaign Gun Everytown for Gun Safety National Rifle Association,A sign in support of gun control advocates at a campaign event in San Diego in 2016.,"Gun control groups are significantly outspending gun rights groups on the 2018 midterm elections so far, according to FEC data compiled by Reuters.

The Spanish-language ad criticizes Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum’s agenda, saying it will result in “abusive taxes,” “excessive government,” “choking bureaucracy and parents losing control over the education of their children.” Several photos of Gillum are used throughout the 30-second ad, but one in particular caused the ire of a survivor of the mass shooting attack on the Orlando Pulse nightclub in 2016 that left 49 people dead. In the photo, Gillum is looking down at a commemorative ribbon for those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the attack, told those on a press call organized by Democrats he’s “sick of Republicans using Pulse as some political prop after they turned their back on that community for so long,” the Tampa Bay Times reported. “I am really sick of desperate political serpents like [GOP nominee] Ron DeSantis who will quite literally say anything and do anything to win elections,” Wolf said. “I am really really sick of the memory of 49 lives constantly being trampled on.” COLORADO SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIM’S FATHER ACCUSES GIFFORDS SUPER PAC AD OF ‘POLITICIZING’ DAUGHTER’S DEATH Geoff Burgan, an advisor to Gillum’s campaign, tweeted the Florida Republican Party “sunk to a new low” with the ad. By Tuesday afternoon, the ad was amended and a different photo of Gillum was used. “There was no intention to be insensitive in anyway,” Meredith Beatrice, a Florida GOP spokeswoman, told the Tampa Bay Times. “However, we stand by the message of the ad.” Last month, a pro-gun control super PAC agreed to change an ad after the father of a Colorado school shooting victim complained it was “politicizing” the death of his daughter. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS The ad from the Giffords PAC criticized Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican up for re-election, for his ties to the National Rifle Association. It featured text messages from “Emily” informing her mother a shooter was in her school. “I’m so scared. I love u. Tell Dad I love him,” the texts in the ad read. John-Michael Keyes said the ad was “problematic” because it seemed to mirror the tragedy his family endured. His daughter, Emily Keyes, was fatally shot in 2006 after a 53-year-old man took several female students hostage at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, and sexually assaulted them. She was 16 years old. Before her death, Keyes texted her family, “I love you guys” and “I love u guys, k?” The super PAC agreed to amend the ad to make it “clear that it is not connected to any one incident.” The Florida gubernatorial election is ranked a tossup by Fox News.

361,10876,http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-trump-nra-gun-control-20180313-story.html,The biggest outrage about America's gun violence is Congress' failure to do anything about it,"On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman used a device known as a bump stock to convert his semiautomatic rifles into de facto machine guns, killing 58 people and wounding 441 more at an outdoor Las Vegas Strip concert venue. The widespread outrage over that massacre fueled calls for a federal ban on bump stocks and related devices, which have no purpose whatsoever other than to circumvent an existing federal ban on most automatic weapons. That political moment passed quickly, though. A month later, a former U.S. airman killed 26 people in a church in Sutherland Hills, Texas, using firearms that his criminal past should have barred him from owning — the Air Force had failed to submit his domestic violence conviction to the federal database used in background checks for gun purchases. Again, there were calls for reform, but no real action beyond the introduction of a modest bill to incentivize better reporting. The grip of the gun lobby evidently matters far more in Washington than the voice of ordinary Americans. Then last month came the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, which left another 17 bodies in its wake. The rage and frustration felt by students who survived the massacre has turned into organizing, resulting in a nationwide school walkout planned for Wednesday as a sign of disgust and solidarity in demanding gun reform. Advertisement So finally, might there be some action? Sort of. Citing the need for students to be safe in schools, President Trump — who had been securely in the NRA’s holster — initially put his weight behind some limited changes in gun laws. But by Monday he had backed away from most of them, opting instead for a Federal Commission on School Safety, just the kind of commission he disparaged at a political rally Saturday. He also suggested using federal money to help train local teachers and other school employees who volunteer to have a weapon at work, and said he would “support the transition of military veterans and retired law enforcement into new careers in education,” all in an effort to “harden” schools “just like our airports, stadiums and government buildings.” So the answer to school shootings — which, as awful as they are, occur rarely — is to make every school in the country a mini-fortress, with armed school personnel ready to open fire should something happen? It doesn’t take much of an imagination to see looming disasters, from teachers making lethally wrong decisions to police rushing in and shooting the wrong armed person, and from students getting hold of the firearms to school employees themselves committing acts of violence. Adding firearms to schools seems like an extraordinarily shortsighted plan. Trump has embraced a couple of considerably better ideas. He said states should adopt laws that make it easier for law enforcement to take firearms from people deemed at risk of violence, as California has already done. And not long after the Las Vegas shooting, he directed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to find a way to ban bump stocks and similar devices. They should be outlawed, but unfortunately, the ATF previously determined that federal law does not give it the authority to do so, so a new ban by the same agency would likely face a legal challenge from the NRA. Congress needs to solve this problem itself. But, well, that isn’t about to happen, even on so flagrant a circumvention of the law as bump stocks. Advertisement That’s the real outrage. Again. Although the conscience of the nation is shocked by these repeated scenes of slaughter, Congress is apparently unmoved. The grip of the gun lobby — led by the National Rifle Assn. — evidently matters far more in Washington than the voice of ordinary Americans, who have expressed overwhelming support for universal background checks and for bans on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines that enable more people to be murdered faster. And if Congress fails to act, polls suggest voters would hold Republicans most responsible. So even facing that political landscape, the party that controls both houses of Congress and the White House can’t see it’s way clear to take solid steps to resolve one of the nation’s most pressing public safety issues. Is it cowardice? Some blind loyalty to an out-of-the-mainstream vision of gun culture — only about one in three U.S. households owns a gun — concocted by the gun lobby? It’s hard to say, and in the end the reason doesn’t really matter. It’s the failure that counts, and voters needs to make sure those who have failed are held to account.

Joe Manchin (D) released a new ad Monday that shows him shooting at the Obamacare lawsuit backed by his Republican challenger, Patrick Morrisey. The ad plays on Manchin's 2010 ad that showed him shooting at a climate change bill. Manchin has taken up the 20-state GOP lawsuit against Obamacare as a weapon against Morrisey, the state attorney general. Morrisey has said he would like to see the Affordable Care Act declared unconstitutional and overturned. A judge in Fort Worth, Texas, began hearing oral arguments in the Republican-led lawsuit against Obamacare last week. Manchin's ad begins with a flashback to his popular 2010 ad. ""Hey, I haven't changed. I might be a few years older but I'll still take on anyone who messes with West Virginia,"" Manchin said in the ad. ""Now, the threat is Patrick Morrisey's lawsuit to take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions."" ""He is just dead wrong and that ain't gonna happen,"" he continued. What did Morrisey say? Morrisey's campaign stated in a news release that the senator's new ad was an effort to cover up Manchin's ""liberal record of failing to protect the Second Amendment."" ""West Virginia has been hurt by lying liberal Joe Manchin putting the interest of Washington liberals ahead of the health care and gun rights of West Virginians,"" Nathan Brand, Morrisey campaign spokesman, said in a news release. ""Joe Manchin has a 'D' rating from the NRA, and voted against President Trump's efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare. Lying liberal Joe has been wrong for West Virginia."" The National Rifle Association recently released an ad that emphasized Manchin's D-rating with the organization.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. The gunman who opened fire on a yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida, killing two and wounding several others, had a history of complaints of harassing young women, police said Saturday. Scott Beierle, 40, turned the gun on himself after the rampage at the Hot Yoga studio in Florida’s capital, which occurred at around 5:37 p.m., police said, and a motive is still unknown. A doctor and college student were killed. ""Scott Beierle entered the business posing as a customer and began shooting patrons with a handgun without warning,"" Tallahassee police said in a statement. ""Patrons fought the assailant to prevent him from harming themselves and others."" Florida yoga studio gunman Scott Beierle is seen in this mugshot from 2016. Leon County Sheriff's Office Beierle, of Deltona, a city near Florida’s Atlantic coast around 200 miles from Tallahassee, had been staying at a local hotel. Police said “he has been the subject of prior calls for service in the Tallahassee area related to harassment of young women” but did not elaborate. The Tallahassee Democrat newspaper, citing Leon County records, reported that Beierle was arrested in 2012 for misdemeanor battery for allegedly grabbing the buttocks of two women on the Florida State University campus. Police reports released Saturday by Tallahassee police show Beierle was arrested in June of 2016 for battery for allegedly slapping and grabbing the rear end of a woman sunbathing in the pool area of an apartment complex where he lived.

Four other people were shot, and a man was pistol-whipped by the gunman, police said. Police said that investigators are still trying to determine a motive in the shooting, and whether Beierle had any connection with the victims or business.

Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare said Vessem was a member of its medical staff and offered thoughts and prayers to the families of Vessem and Binkley and all the victims and their families.

Two of the victims who survived the shooting were in stable condition at a hospital, and three others were treated at hospitals and released, police said. Melissa Hutchinson, a bartender who was at a nearby bar when the shooting occurred, said people ran in to seek safety, including one woman who said there was an active shooter and to lock the doors. Hutchinson, who is CPR-certified and first-aid trained, helped them, some of whom had been shot. Maura Binkley via Facebook ""They were very emotional. They just saw people get shot,"" Hutchinson said. “They were able to talk, and they were able to cry ... everybody was just very shaken,"" she said. One of those who sought refuge was a man who tried to fight off the attacker and who was pistol-whipped by the gunman, she said. ""They said that he came in and he had a black bag and he pulled it out and as [the gunman] went to go load it, all the yoga studio, the instructor and everybody started pounding on the windows and on the walls to let people know,"" Hutchinson said.

It is highly unlikely this lack of focus was due to weariness. “You’ve got to wonder,” Kelly said in a phone interview, whether the president would have had a more intense reaction if the news reports suggested “the shooter was of a different ethnicity.” True that. During his government-shutdown-immigration rants, Trump kept pointing out that the man who killed eight people with a truck in Manhattan had come to the country through a visa lottery system. That happened on Oct. 31. Since that time, 73 people have been killed in mass shootings in this country. But about gun regulation we have not heard a presidential peep. The unusual thing about that terrible Manhattan tragedy is that it was not committed with a gun. Depending on how you count them, we’ve had around 30 acts of terrorism since 9/11 that involved multiple deaths. More than half were committed by right-wing extremists (think Charleston church shooting). And virtually all of them were gun violence. So, this is the time when we talk about gun regulation. Come on. Energize. We are resigned to the fact that there is nothing, no matter how horrific, that will convince any politician in the thrall of the National Rifle Association to consider even the most modest gun-safety legislation.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. Twenty-two years after the deadliest mass shooting in British history, survivors of the Dunblane Primary School massacre are sharing words of compassion — and caution — to students in Parkland, Florida. ""Never let anyone forget. There will be attempts to deflect you, to divide you and doubtless to intimidate you, but you've already shown great wisdom and strength,"" the survivors and victims' families wrote Tuesday in an open letter published on BuzzFeed UK to mark the anniversary of the March 13, 1996, rampage in Scotland. The mass shooting spurred political action that toughened British gun laws. The survivors' letter comes as students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and thousands of others across the United States are planning a school walkout Wednesday to protest gun violence. They will step out of classes for 17 minutes to honor the Parkland victims — 14 students and three staff members. Another nationwide student-led demonstration known as the March for Our Lives is planned for Washington, D.C., and other U.S. cities on March 24. ""Wherever you march, whenever you protest, however you campaign for a more sensible approach to gun ownership we will be there with you in spirit,"" the Dunblane survivors wrote. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha The small Scottish town became a symbol for gun reform in the wake of the mass shooting. A 43-year-old man carrying four handguns fatally shot a teacher and 16 children — aged 5 and 6 — before killing himself. Related: How a school shooting changed British gun laws In the incident's aftermath, gun reform advocates created the ""Snowdrop Campaign"" — named after the only spring flower in bloom at the time of the massacre. By the following year, British politicians approved a ban on the private ownership of most guns, including semiautomatic firearms. The law is credited for Britain having one of the lowest gun homicide rates in the developed world — at 0.07 deaths per 100,000, compared to 3.85 in the U.S. in 2016, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Random shootings in Hungerford, England, also sparked a 1988 law that banned the ownership of high-powered self-loading rifles.

Stefan Rousseau / PA Wire via AP file Other mass shootings in the United States, including the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, have resulted in the Dunblane community sending messages of support. But the lack of any substantive action by America has puzzled some in the Scottish town. ""We got something done about it, whereas for families in America there is still suffering,"" Alison Ross, whose older sister was among the victims in Dunblane, told NBC's U.K. partner, ITV News, in 2016. The letter in response to Parkland was organized by gun control advocate Mick North, whose daughter, Sophie, was killed in Dunblane. ""Like you we vowed to do something about it,"" the survivors and victims' families wrote. ""We persuaded British lawmakers not to be swayed by the vested interests of the gun lobby, we asked them to put public safety first and to heed what the majority of the British people wanted. Most politicians listened and acted."" In the U.S., Democratic legislators have demanded stricter gun control laws, but face an uphill battle from the Trump administration. The White House on Sunday said it will propose funding firearms training for school personnel and bolster firearm background checks, but steered clear of a previous idea floated by President Donald Trump to raise the minimum legal age to buy semiautomatic weapons from 18 to 21.

827,10872,https://nz.news.yahoo.com/standout-moments-made-cnn-apos-165353400.html,The standout moments that made CNN's gun control town hall feel like a game-changer,"On Wednesday night, a raw, emotional town hall about gun control on CNN emerged as a pivotal moment in the debate over gun control. As a crowd of several thousand cheered and jeered, the survivors and families of the victims of last week's shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, pushed back on Senator Marco Rubio and NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch more than any member of the media has. SEE ALSO: Amy Poehler blasts NRA after they tweeted a 'Parks & Rec' GIF This movement is being led by a group of brave and mature-beyond-their-years teenagers who are unafraid to express their fury at an inactive government and the big money that enables them. And it finally feels like this time, finally, something is different. That it was all broadcast on a national platform like CNN was even more crucial, and it provided a stark contrast to the usual empty talking points that are circulated by six-pundit panels on cable news. While such town halls are often devoid of substance, the students and their tenacity not only broke the cycle of these pointless made-for-TV debates, but also changed the conversation in the process. Students like Emma Gonzalez and Cameron Kasky have given voice to the anger and grief we've collectively felt too many times. They've channeled their outrage and exasperation in a way that, though sometimes uncomfortable, refused to let apathy sink in, cracking the shiny facade of cable news and pushing the gun debate forward. Emma Gonzalez, Sheriff Israel refuse to let Dana Loesch off the hook Emma Gonzalez has already gained notice for her passionate speech in the wake of the shooting, and on Wednesday night she was one of many students bravely stood their ground against those in power — including NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch. Loesch has caused controversy in the past with her pro-gun statements for the NRA, but that didn't rattle Gonzalez, who not only didn't blink in the face of one of America's most (in)famous gun advocates, but wouldn't let Loesch get away with ducking the question, proving herself to be a tougher questioner than so many reporters have in the past. And Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel followed up on Gonzalez's questioning, refusing to let Loesch off easy for her stance, telling her, ""You're not standing up for [the students] until you say 'I want less weapons.'"" The one-two combo of a student survivor and a respected law enforcement official — whose jurisdiction includes the school where the shooting occurred — was an undeniable show of unity against an organization that has sunk countless millions into making sure guns like the one used in this (and other) mass shootings remain obtainable. Cameron Kasky and Fred Guttenberg corner Senator Marco Rubio When given the chance to directly confront an elected official that is supposed to represent the people, it's reasonable to think that the heat of your argument might dim a little because of the weight of the moment. But not in the case of Cameron Kasky. Another student survivor of the shooting, Kasky called Rubio out on his acceptance of NRA campaign contributions and challenged him to start turning them down as cheers from attendees rained down. The debate around the NRA's lobbying efforts is another milestone in the familiar cycle of mass shootings. Those lawmakers that accept the NRA's money are called out, time and again. Yet few of them have had to face down survivors of a mass shooting like Rubio did on Wednesday night in front of a national television audience. SEE ALSO: Powerful New York Times ad calls out lawmakers funded by the NRA Kasky wasn't the only one who pressed Rubio hard. Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the shooting, told Rubio point blank that statements made by him and by President Trump in the wake of the shooting were ""pathetically weak."" Rubio was forced to look into the eyes of a parent who'd lost his child and address his views. The in-person audience hurled boos at Rubio while an anguished parent lambasted him in a way he's not used to. It was raw and riveting and beyond any television CNN or its competitors have produced in a long time. It was also probably the toughest questioning Rubio has ever faced — on CNN or any other news channel. And that it came from a high school student and a grieving parent shouldn't be lost on us. A new bar for holding politicians accountable has been set.

The suit, filed Monday in Seattle, asks a judge to block the federal government’s late-June settlement with Defense Distributed, which allowed the company to make the plans available online. Officials say that 1,000 people have already downloaded blueprints for AR-15 rifles. “I have a question for the Trump Administration: Why are you allowing dangerous criminals easy access to weapons?” Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, said in a statement Monday. “These downloadable guns are unregistered and very difficult to detect, even with metal detectors, and will be available to anyone regardless of age, mental health or criminal history.” Joining the suit were Democratic attorneys general in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Maryland, New York and the District of Columbia. Separately, attorneys general in 21 states urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Monday to withdraw from the settlement with Defense Distributed, saying it “creates an imminent risk to public safety.” People can use the blueprints to manufacture a plastic gun using a 3D printer. But gun industry experts have expressed doubt that criminals would go to the trouble, since the printers needed to make the guns are very expensive, the guns themselves tend to disintegrate quickly and traditional firearms are easy to come by. Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distributed, first published downloadable designs for a 3D-printed firearm in 2013. It was downloaded about 100,000 times until the State Department ordered him to cease, contending it violated federal export laws since some of the blueprints were downloaded by people outside the United States. Story continues The State Department reversed course in late June, agreeing to allow Wilson to resume posting the blueprints. The files were published on Friday. The company filed its own suit in Texas on Sunday, asserting that it’s the victim of an “ideologically-fueled program of intimidation and harassment” that violates the company’s First Amendment rights. The company’s attorney, Josh Blackman, called it an “easy case.” States are free to enact gun control measures, but “what they can’t do is censor the speech of another citizen in another state, and they can’t regulate the commerce of another citizen in another state when that commerce is authorized by a federal government license,” Blackman said in an interview Monday. “It’s a violation of the First Amendment, it’s unconscionable and we’re going to fight it to the very end.” Defense Distributed agreed to temporarily block Pennsylvania residents from downloading the plans after state officials went to federal court in Philadelphia on Sunday seeking an emergency order. The company said it has also blocked access to users in New Jersey and Los Angeles.",3D printed firearms Gun 3D printing Ghost gun Gun control Firearm Printing AR-15 style rifle Assault rifle Rifle,A 3-D-printed gun with a 3D-printed gun.,"Eight states are filing suit against the Trump administration over its decision to allow a Texas company to publish downloadable blueprints for a 3D-printed gun, contending the hard-to-trace plastic weapons are a boon to terrorists and criminals and threaten public safety.

966,10248,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trump-said-mental-illness-leads-to-gun-violence-heres-why-doctors-disagree,Trump said mental illness leads to gun violence. Here’s why doctors disagree,"Frustration is mounting in the medical community as the Trump administration again points to mental illness in response to yet another mass shooting. “The concept that mental illness is a precursor to violent behavior is nonsense,” said Dr. Louis Kraus, forensic psychiatry chief at Chicago’s Rush University Medical College. “The vast majority of gun violence is not attributable to mental illness.” Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old charged with killing 17 people on Valentine’s Day at his former high school in Parkland, Florida has been described by students as a loner with troubling behavior who had been kicked out of school. His mother recently died and Cruz had been staying with family friends. “The vast majority of gun violence is not attributable to mental illness.” Since the shooting, his mental health has been the focus of President Donald Trump’s comments. And on a Thursday call with reporters, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the administration is committed to addressing serious mental illness and that his agency “will be laser-focused on this issue in the days, weeks, and months to come.” Mental health professionals welcome more resources and attention, but they say the administration is ignoring the real problem — easy access to guns, particularly the kind of high-powered highly lethal assault weapons used in many of the most recent mass shootings. “Even for those who manage to survive gun violence involving these weapons, the severity and lasting impact of their wounds, disabilities and treatment leads to devastating consequences,” American Medical Association President David Barbe wrote in an online column after the shooting. “We are not talking about Second Amendment rights or restricting your ability to own a firearm. We are talking about a public health crisis that our Congress has failed to address. This must end,” Barbe wrote. Better access to mental health care, including for those who might be prone to violence, is important, but “to blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient,” he said in an interview Friday. The AMA has supported efforts to boost gun violence research, ban assault weapons and to restrict access to automatic weapons. Barbe wrote in his column that federally funded research is crucial to address an “urgent health crisis.” Under gun industry pressure, U.S. government research on firearm violence has been limited for decades. Under gun industry pressure, U.S. government research on firearm violence has been limited for decades. The American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and four other medical associations issued a joint statement Friday urging comprehensive action by Trump and Congress, including labeling gun violence a national public health epidemic. The groups’ recommendations include limits on high-powered, rapid-fire weapons designed to kill and funding gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC, there were about 38,000 U.S. gun deaths in 2016, slightly more than the number of people who died in car crashes. “The families of the victims in Parkland and all those whose lives have been impacted by daily acts of gun violence deserve more than our thoughts and prayers. They need action from the highest levels of our government to stop this epidemic of gun violence now,” the groups said in a statement. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Osteopathic Association contributed to the statement. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Sunday that Trump is working with senators on a bill designed to improve criminal background checks. “While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the President is supportive of efforts to improve the Federal background check system,” she said. Florida’s Republican governor, Rick Scott, a Trump ally, said he had discussed with Trump and GOP leaders how to restrict gun access to the mentally ill. Federal and state laws already attempt to do this, in many cases with a ban on gun ownership for people who have been treated in mental institutions. Kraus noted that a year ago Trump rolled back an Obama-era law that aimed to prevent certain mentally ill people from buying guns. But he suggested that is beside the point. “There’s a great naivete to what the president and the governor are proposing,” Kraus said. A history of violent behavior, alcohol and substance use, and previous criminal behavior are all more pertinent factors to consider. Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of a violence prevention research program at the University of California, Davis, said gun violence restraining order laws in California and Washington are “a much more focused approach.” The laws allow courts to keep guns out of the hands of people who pose threats to themselves or others. “Florida has no such mechanism.

Planned walkouts for the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting were canceled for the school district shortly after news of the incident spread. A school resource officer at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida, first heard what he believed to be a loud “bang” sound at 8:39 a.m., Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods told reporters in a briefing Friday. Nearly three minutes later, the officer located the shooter and was able to take him or her into custody. Woods did not say how the shooter was neutralized, though he added that the shooter offered little resistance. The officer also found a 17-year-old student shot in the ankle. Woods added that the victim’s injuries were non-life-threatening. There were no other injuries reported in this morning’s incident. LIVE Press Conference on Forest High School Shooting Posted by Marion County Sheriff's Office on Friday, April 20, 2018 Woods didn’t offer many additional details about the suspect, but did say it was a 19-year-old non-student. He did not say whether the shooter was a former student of the school, but said the shooting appeared to be “intentional.” The sheriff declined to identify the weapon used in the shooting. “Although we have come to a safe conclusion, it is still an investigation, and there’s a lot of details that we don’t know,” Woods said. In an initial update on Facebook, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that the suspect was in custody and that the wounded student was being treated by medics.

The Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program does not specifically prohibit weapons purchases and would allow DeVos to decide which states or school districts could use the funding for guns and training, sources told The New York Times on Wednesday. The $1 billion student support program is intended to fund the country’s poorest schools, the newspaper noted, adding that funds are typically allocated toward improving education curriculum, school conditions or technology for digital literacy. ADVERTISEMENT The Education Department would likely approve the gun purchases under the goal of improving school conditions, the sources told the Times. Schools that would reportedly receive fund would be encouraged to increase mental health counseling, create dropout prevention programs and help students acclimate from the juvenile justice system. “The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,” Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, told the newspaper. “The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” The move would be a historic break of precedent from the longstanding federal government policy of not to paying for weapons inside schools, the newspaper noted. Congress passed a bipartisan school safety bill earlier this year that created a new grant program to help educate students and teachers about warning signs for gun violence. School safety became a national talking point after the school shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Santa Fe, Texas earlier this year.

""If they go into a school, a gun-free zone is like target practice for these guys. They see that and that's what they want. Gun-free zones are very dangerous,” Trump said in February. Trump established the White House school safety commission in March to “study and make recommendations” on several topics, such as age restrictions for certain gun purchases. DeVos, who leads the panel, said after that the commission would not look into the role firearms play in gun violence at schools.

1,10073,https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-shooter-troubled-loner-white-supremacist-ties-213321497.html,Florida shooter a troubled loner with white supremacist ties,"Parkland (Etats-Unis) (AFP) - Nikolas Cruz was expelled from school, threatened fellow students and posted ""very disturbing"" messages on social media, along with pictures of his favorite guns. But despite broad signs suggesting he was a deeply troubled young man, Cruz was able to return to his Parkland, Florida high school Wednesday with an assault rifle and open fire, killing 17 students and adults. A mugshot of Cruz, released after his arrest, depicts a young man seemingly little different from any other 19-year-old -- cleanly-cut chestnut hair, hazel eyes, his face speckled with freckles. But the information emerging since his attack suggests there were red flags that should have set off danger alerts. Fellow students knew he posted violent messages on line. And someone using the same name had published a comment on YouTube last year saying: ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" That was reported to the FBI, but they never traced it back to Cruz. Cruz had also joined the white supremacist group Republic of Florida, participating in their paramilitary training exercises, a member of the group told US media. And Broward County Mayor Beam Furr said he had been treated for a time at a mental health clinic, though he had not been back for over a year. - 'A lot of problems' - Cruz arrived Wednesday afternoon at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in a sprawling Florida suburb north of Miami just before school let out, opening fire with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle originally designed for combat. Before he was expelled last year, he had a reputation among the 3,000-strong student body as ""weird"" and ""threatening,"" according to students and teachers. ""I met him last year, he was in my class at the beginning of the year and when I first met him I knew that something was off about him and he was kind of weird,"" Manolo Alvarez, 17, told AFP. ""People would bully him once in a while and spread rumors about him, like he was planning a school shooting, and nobody believed it. We thought it was just rumors until sadly it actually happened,"" Alvarez said. Story continues Dakota Mutchler, 17, told the Washington Post he began selling knives in school out of his lunchbox, and posted on Instagram about his guns and about killing animals. His interest in guns wouldn't have been extraordinary. He had been a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, a government high school program that provides preparatory training for the military, including marksmanship. But his behavior eventually gave rise to strong concerns from the school administration. According to another pupil, Nicholas Coke, Cruz had ""a lot of problems,"" recalling an incident during middle school when Cruz kicked out a window. - 'They didn't see this coming ' - Jim Gard, a math teacher who had taught Cruz for a semester in 2016, told the Miami Herald that teachers were notified he had been expelled, and could not be permitted back on school grounds with a backpack. ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus."" He clearly had a difficult childhood. Cruz was given up for adoption at birth in September 1998, along with a brother. The adoptive parents were a couple in their 50s, according to the Sun Sentinel, the local newspaper. His father died when he was still young, while his mother passed away last November, leaving the boys in the care of a family friend, according to the Sentinel. Neighbors said he got in trouble repeatedly for minor incidents as he grew up, and that police were called a number of times, the Sentinel reported. One said he was seen shooting another neighbor's chickens. When he moved in with another family after his mother died, they kept his legally owned AR-15 locked in a cabinet, though Cruz had a key, according to Jim Lewis, the family's attorney. ""The family is devastated, they didn't see this coming,"" Lewis said, according to the Sentinel. ""He was a little quirky and he was depressed about his mom's death, but who wouldn't be?""",Nikolas Cruz Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School School shooting Shooting Murder Mass shooting AR-15 style rifle Suspect Student,"A photograph of the suspect, Nikolas Cruz.","Parkland (Etats-Unis) (AFP) - Nikolas Cruz was expelled from school, threatened fellow students and posted ""very disturbing"" messages on social media, along with pictures of his favorite guns.","nikolas cruz was expelled from school after being expelled from high school for a year. despite broad signs suggesting he was a troubled young man, he was able to return to his parkland, florida high school with an assault rifle and open fire. the information emerging since his attack suggests there were red flags that should have set off danger alerts, fellow students knew he posted violent messages",1,1,4,6,1,0,1,0.0,7,0

The measure increases the age limit to buy a pistol or semi-automatic assault rifle from 18 to 21, imposes a 10-day waiting period for purchases, and increases background checks. According to CBS affiliate KIRO-TV, Initiative 1639 passed with 60 percent approval. In addition to the change in purchase age, the initiative prohibits anyone who is not a Washington resident from buying a semi-automatic assault rifle in the state. In addition, it holds gun owners responsible for safely storing their firearms. Supporters said the goal is to make schools and communities safer by putting checks in place to keep weapons out of dangerous hands. One of the initiative's supporters is Paul Kramer, whose son was wounded in a shooting at a party in Mukilteo, Washington, in 2016. The gunman legally purchased the weapon used in the shooting when he was 19. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox ""If Initiative 1639 had been in place in 2016, he would not have been able to purchase the semi-automatic assault rifle that allowed him to seriously injure my son and kill three of his close friends,"" Kramer said in September. Opponents argued the law puts people at risk by restricting access to guns for self-defense. Another measure that won approval in Washington is Initiative 940, which makes it easier to prosecute police for negligent shootings. It aims to improve police training in de-escalation tactics and eliminates a requirement that prosecutors prove officers acted with malice to get a conviction in negligent shootings.

""They have great power over you people,"" Trump said on Feb. 28, referring to the NRA while addressing a group of lawmakers at the White House. ""They have less power over me."" But now Trump has retreated, putting forward a modest package of gun-safety measures this week that has none of the provisions opposed by the NRA that he seemed to back days earlier. The shift provides another example of the strong influence wielded by the NRA both at the White House and on Capitol Hill, where most lawmakers remain opposed to significant policy changes in the wake of the shooting massacre that killed 17 at a Parkland, Florida, high school last month. ""I think we could all see it coming. I wish the president had televised the meeting with the NRA like he televised the meeting with us,"" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Monday, referring to a March 1 huddle between Trump and top officials at the gun rights group. ""Clearly, the NRA was more persuasive than I was."" In the face of such criticism, Trump defended his plan in a series of tweets Monday morning. ""Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House. Legislation moving forward. Bump Stocks will soon be out. Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law. Armed guards OK, deterrent!"" Trump wrote in one Twitter message. White House officials said Trump's official gun plan was drafted within the confines of what Congress will allow - a notable contrast to Trump's ""I alone can fix it"" image as someone who could single-handedly cut through Washington gridlock. Administration officials also disputed that Trump's plan amounts to a reversal of his positions since that February meeting, when the president surprised lawmakers of both parties by appearing to back proposals to raise the purchase age for AR-15s and similar types of rifles and to expand background checks. He also declared at that meeting that law enforcement officials should ""take the guns first, go through due process second"" for those suspected of mental illness. ""He hasn't backed away from these things at all,"" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during a contentious back-and-forth with reporters Monday. ""But he can't make them happen with a broad stroke of the pen. You have to have some congressional component to do some of these things, and without that support, it's not as possible."" Publicly, Republican senators had dismissed Trump's embrace of Democratic-friendly gun measures as the negotiating tactic of a businessman who wanted to hear from all sides before coming to a decision. His defenders on Capitol Hill said much the same Monday, arguing that Trump's plan was crafted in political reality, considering the composition of Congress. ""I've called the meeting we had at the White House on TV really more of a brainstorming session. It was not a legislative strategy session,"" Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texs, said Monday. ""I think as the president and the White House has talked to Congress, they found out what is achievable and what's not."" Yet Vice President Mike Pence spoke with a number of Senate Republicans who privately raised serious concerns about what Trump said at the gun summit, according to one White House official who was not authorized to talk on the record and so spoke on the condition of anonymity. Montana's Sen. Steve Daines was among the GOP lawmakers who reached out to the administration with worries about what was said, conveying his concerns to the White House's legislative staff. ""We really reengaged and reemphasized the points I made to the president in that meeting: First thing we need to do to make kids safe is to make our schools safe,"" Daines said Monday. ""I'm pleased to see that he's moved away from a focus on gun control and now focused on stopping people who have a homicidal intent."" At a meeting on March 1, NRA lobbyist Chris Cox told Trump that some of his ideas, particularly raising the age limit to buy a semiautomatic rifle from 18 to 21, wouldn't pass and that raising the age wouldn't stop crimes, according to people briefed on the meeting. Cox also said the background check legislation being supported by the White House would go too far, these people said. Trump saw the arguments as convincing, said two people who later spoke to him. The meeting was warm, these people said, with the president telling Cox that he valued the NRA and wanted to be on the same page. Cox and NRA President Wayne LaPierre, who met with Trump earlier, made clear to the president that the NRA supported him and did not want to be at odds. The president was also taken aback by how many GOP lawmakers told him that his proposals were unlikely to pass, two senior administration officials said. He later told others in the White House that he wanted to support only legislation that could pass. One senior administration official said Trump was never determined to pass everything he proposed or seemed to suggest in the bipartisan summit but likes to publicly gauge what others are thinking. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows, R-N.C., told Trump that broad gun laws were not going to pass, according to a senior administration official. A number of senior aides also told the president that there were not enough votes on the Hill to raise the purchase age for some guns, the official said. ""At first, he really wanted to do it . . . everyone was telling him, embrace this moment,"" one Trump adviser said. But now ""he is telling people how supportive the NRA has been to him. He knows they are an important ally."" Another senior administration official said that Trump ""does things on the fly"" in sessions like the one on guns and that they aren't real promises or formal positions. His team was already drafting legislative proposals that mirrored what eventually came out, this official said. Now, the Trump administration is focused on two main pieces of legislation: a bill to improve the federal background check database and a measure to shore up safety at schools, including grants to fund violence-prevention training for teachers and students. Both are broadly popular on Capitol Hill, although a handful of Republican senators are objecting to speedy passage of the background check bill. The White House also wants states to pass bills for ""risk-protection orders,"" which allow law enforcement to take guns away from people considered a public threat, and it is establishing a Federal Commission on School Safety, to be chaired by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, that will explore possible solutions. Trump's plan does not include an endorsement of a bipartisan measure written by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., to expand background checks to firearms sales at gun shows and online purchases, confusing key lawmakers who believed that Trump would get on board with the bill. ""Why did he talk about it so favorably in the public meeting?"" Manchin asked of Trump and his bill. ""I don't think the president seemed to be concerned about that, but I'm sure some of the more politically astute staff may be."" Despite the White House's comments that it was working within the realm of the possible, some proposals in Trump's plan aren't politically achievable in Congress. One of the most controversial would give ""rigorous firearms training"" to some teachers to protect students - an idea that would struggle mightily to pass. ""I don't think there's a lot of support for that,"" Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a reliable ally of the White House, said Monday. ""I just don't think that there's a move to arm teachers. I'm not particularly opposed to that, but there would have to be tremendous training and tremendous effort to make that work.""

Joaquin Oliver was a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a former student allegedly opened fire Wednesday. It's the deadliest school shooting in the U.S. since the 2012 rampage at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26. Oliver was born in Venezuela and became a proud U.S. citizen in January 2017, according to ABC affiliate WPLG. He was an avid fan of Venezuala's national soccer team, American football, basketball, Florida State University and R&B artist Frank Ocean. His last social media post was dedicated to his girlfriend Victoria Gonzalez. ""Thank you lord for putting a greater blessing than I could ever imagine into my life this past year,"" he wrote. ""I love you with all my heart."" Gonzalez, in an interview with ""Good Morning America"" remembered him as ""the most incredible soul ever."" ""His heart was so big; all he did was love everyone,"" she said. ""He told me all the time that what he wanted in life was to make everyone else feel loved. ""He was everyone's hero."" Most of the mourners who came out to pay their respects to Oliver's funeral on Saturday afternoon, according to ABC News affiliate WPLG, wore sports jerseys as a tribute to the youth they nicknamed ""Guac."" Funeral services have already been held for some of the other victims. The service for Alyssa Alhadeff, 14, who played soccer, was held in North Lauderdale on Friday morning. The funeral for Meadow Pollack, 18, a college-bound senior, took place in Parkland on Friday afternoon. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump made a series of phone calls to offer his personal condolences and support and also get updates from his Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. He spoke to Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky, Broward County Commissioner Michael Udine, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Principal Ty Thompson. Joaquin Oliver is seen here in this undated file photo. Instagram Since the mass shooting, there have been multiple community vigils and religious services in Broward County in the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting. Life Fellowship Church in Coral Springs organized a prayer and peace walk around the community Saturday morning. Alexander-Levitt Funerals and Cremations in Tamarac will host a candlelight vigil Saturday evening. First United Methodist Church in Coral Springs will hold prayer services Sunday morning. And, Tomorrow's Rainbow, a non-profit in Coconut Creek, is hosting candlelight vigils and offering bereavement counselors every night through March 10 from 6 to 7:30 p.m. ET.

Joe Skipper/Reuters Investigators believe approximately 150 shots were fired during Wednesday's attack, a law enforcement source told ABC News. In addition to the 17 killed, more than a dozen people were injured. As of Saturday, the hospitals have one patient in critical condition and four patients in fair condition. The Broward Education Foundation, which raises money for the public school system, has set up an official page on crowdfunding site GoFundMe for those wanting to make monetary donations to the affected individuals and families. There are other pages set up for specific victims and their loved ones. GoFundMe spokesman Bobby Whithorne said they have removed campaigns with no direct connection to the victims in the shooting or their families. ""We guarantee the money raised by those campaigns will be transferred to the right person,"" Whithorne told ABC News. ""We will continue to monitor the platform and will stay in close touch with Florida officials.""

Rhona Wise/AFP/Getty Images The alleged gunman in Wednesday's rampage, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, has been arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. He is being held in a Broward County jail without bond. His public defender Howard Finkelstein told ABC News' Adrienne Bankert that his teenage client is willing to plead guilty to avoid a costly, time-consuming trial in return to spare him of the death penalty, and wants the accused mass murderer to serve a life sentence instead. ""If it were my kid, I can't tell you that I wouldn't want to kill him personally,"" Finkelstein said. ""But this isn't a matter of trying to get to a place of perfect justice. ""I'm trying to get to a place where there can be closure and we can move forward, and I think that it's in the best interest of both the defendant, the community, the victims, the prosecution -- everybody -- to end this thing. End it quickly, rebuild the community and then change it and protect it. That's my hope."" The idea here is that the harm has been done, and whether Cruz is locked up for the rest of his life or put to death by the state, ""it won't make one more student safe."" Finkelstein also explained that none of the facts are in question and that Cruz’s alleged shooting spree occurred after he was crying out on social media and apparently a series of breakdowns various lines of defense to prevent the bloodshed specifically calling out what he considered to be Cruz's desperate cries for help before he went on the rampage. “This kid, in his own way, was screaming out in every way the mind knows how to scream out. He did everything including saying ‘I want to go and shoot people in school.’ I don’t know what you can do more than that to get somebodies attention,” Finkelstein said. “I don’t know how much more clear it can get than somebody gutting animals with a cache of weapons with hate speech and posting I want to become a professional school shooter.” Beyond Cruz's mental state and shirking meds Finkelstein blames himself for having blind spots and allowing for lapses in law enforcement, social services and education to not be able to thwart what he dubbed Broward County's 9/11 and ""the worst crime I've ever seen."" ""We all failed here,"" he said, noting the sheriffs and social workers and feds aren't bad, but the system needs to be fixed. ""The reason this worked is we don't have a system. The whole thing is made up of words to make it sound like we have a system, we have wrap-around services."" Earlier today more than 100 protesters stood outside the National Rifle Association headquarters in Fairfax, Virginia, on Friday night, demanding action on gun control following the school shooting in Florida. Among the crowd of demonstrators were friends of some of the students and faculty members who were killed at Marjory Stoneman, as well as Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., and relatives of those fatally shot at Virginia Tech in 2007. ""Children are dead because of you,"" Connolly said of the NRA, according to ABC affiliate WJLA.

She's anti-gun violence. While volunteering at San Francisco General Hospital in the 1990s London helped a family whose daughter had fatally shot herself in the stomach. The patient, who was no older than 16, wasn't trying to kill herself; she was in a fight with a boyfriend and was trying to get his attention. ""I remember this girl on the gurney, sitting up screaming, 'Help me,'"" London, who now is a primary care physician in rural Maine, said in an interview with CBS News on Monday. ""It's not an injury you could get from any weapon besides a gun."" That moment, plus other experiences like it, pushed London to join scores of other doctors in a Twitter brawl that erupted over the weekend, pitting members of the medical community against the National Rifle Association. The physicians strongly pushed back after the gun lobby publicly told doctors to ""stay in your lane"" when it comes to gun research.

The tweet came just hours before the mass shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, which claimed 12 lives and once more refocused national attention on the gun debate. Many in the medical community jumped on the tweet, using the hashtag #ThisIsOurLane. ""Do you have any idea how many bullets I pull out of corpses weekly? This isn't just my lane. It's my f**king highway,"" wrote Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist, in a tweet that went viral. Melinek, who regularly appears as an expert witness in homicide cases involving guns, estimates she's autopsied about 300 bodies that were victims of firearm violence. Judy Melinek, M.D. CEO, PathologyExpert, Inc. Judy Melinek ""That's the absurdity of some of the criticism, we know exactly what damage they do to the human body,"" Melinek said in a telephone interview with CBS News on Monday. London, who herself owns two handguns and two shotguns, aimed her Twitter ire at Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator known for provocative opinions. ""Emergency room doctors pull cue balls, vines & gummy bears out of human orifices every week,"" Coulter wrote. ""That doesn't make them experts on pool, horticulture or chewy candy."" ""We do examine a**holes all day so it does make us an expert on them. You qualify,"" London fired back in a tweet. Whether doctors should be conducting research on gun violence has been the subject of intense debate between the medical community and pro-gun groups like the NRA for years. Such work has been limited by the Dickey Amendment, a provision in the 1996 omnibus federal spending bill which instructed that ""none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" Many public health advocates, including London, view the bill as effectively a gag order on gun-violence research. ""It's the most reprehensible piece of legislative ever written,"" London said. ""It's disgusting and needs to go away."" Because of the legislation limiting federal funding, most research on gun violence occurs on a smaller scale. In its full critique of the American College of Physicians, the NRA points to the policy statement's reliance on studies with small sample sizes as a reason why the findings are not conclusive. ""The authors acknowledge evidence is limited but cite their own belief there is 'enough evidence' or simply argue the policy should be enacted anyway,"" wrote the NRA. ""Inconclusive evidence is not 'enough evidence.'"" Many in the medical community, including Melinek, feel it's their responsibility to address the what they believe is an epidemic of gun violence. She points out how research conducted by physicians on the automotive and cigarette industries helped inform public opinion and prompt regulations that ultimately saved countless lives. ""If you're muzzling doctors, then you can't do that research,"" Melinek said. ""How are we suppose to solve this problem?"" The NRA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. While the Dickey Amendment hasn't been repealed in full, a change of language introduced earlier this year did allow for a CDC study on gun deaths published on Friday. The study found that after a decade of decline, homicides by gun were on the rise and firearm suicides have steadily increased since the financial meltdown of 2007 and 2008, despite the economic rebound.

REUTERS/Dana Feldman Thomson Reuters By Dana Feldman THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (Reuters) - Mourners returned on Monday to the scene of a shooting rampage at a bar in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks, where a Chicago-area carpenter erected wooden crosses dedicated to each of the 12 victims. Greg Zanis, who has been building crosses to remember shooting victims for more than two decades, said he arrived in Thousand Oaks, 40 miles northwest of Los Angeles, early on Sunday morning to meet the families and put up the crosses. ""I'm working for the families. I always bring a double set. I sand them, I paint them, I put hearts on them and I put their names on them. I also put their photo on there in black and white as a ghost. It's the most personal gift a carpenter can give to a grieving family,"" Zanis, 67, told Reuters. A former U.S. Marine combat veteran opened fire last week in the Borderline Bar and Grill bar, which was packed with line-dancing college students, killing 12 people in a mass shooting that stunned Thousand Oaks, a bucolic Southern California community with a reputation for safety. The gunman, identified by police as 28-year-old Ian David Long, was found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound following the massacre. Zanis said he had returned from Pittsburgh, where he had delivered 11 Stars of David in remembrance of the worshippers shot dead on Oct. 27 at the Tree of Life synagogue, before setting out for Thousand Oaks in his truck filled with crosses. The master carpenter said he began his one-man mission in 1996 when he found the body of his father-in-law, who had been shot to death. In 1999, he erected 13 crosses in Colorado in honor of the victims of the shooting rampage at Columbine High School, where 12 students and a teacher were killed. Zanis makes the crosses by hand and drives to each site in his truck, making a 4,000-mile round trip for the Thousand Oaks shooting. He accepts only small donations to help pay for gas. He said he would stop in Las Vegas on the way home to deliver a cross to the brother of shooting victim Justin Meeks before starting on a series of crosses to memorialize victims of the California wildfires. ""I'm going to go home and start making as many as I can. I'm going to need a trailer to carry that many on my next trip,"" he said.

He added that he would allocate federal funding to training said educators. “I want my schools protected just like I want my banks protected,” the president said. Trump first floated the armed-teachers idea — which is backed by the National Rifle Association — on Wednesday during an emotional listening session with survivors and parents of the Florida shooting as well as other students, teacher and families affected by gun violence in schools. Trump has also voiced support for raising the minimum age for buying certain guns from 18 to 21, and enhanced background checks for people purchasing firearms — but said Thursday that he disapproved of schools holding active shooter drills to prepare students and staff for the worst. “Active shooter drills is a very negative thing,” Trump said after Pam Stewart, the Florida Department of Education commissioner, brought up the drills. “I don’t like it. I’d much rather have a hardened school.” Trump added that active shooter drills were “crazy,” and “very hard on children.” Trump also tweeted this morning that he wants to give “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience,” which he estimated is 20 percent of teachers. I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC.

Alan Gottlieb of the Bellevue, Wash.-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, said opponents will sue to block I-1639. “A handful of billionaires put in millions of dollars to buy votes and we were outspent,” he said. “But while they were able to buy votes, our hope is they won’t be able to buy judges.” “A handful of billionaires put in millions of dollars to buy votes and we were outspent.

The push for change quickened over the weekend as powerful cries for gun law reform from the kids who escaped the rampage rang in the nation's ears. Delta Air Lines, United and Avis Budget Group joined a growing list of powerful firms that severed ties with the National Rifle Association. And a CNN/SSRS poll showed 70% of Americans want tougher regulation of firearms. But as soon as Washington got back in the game Monday, it looked a lot more like business as usual , as a push for new regulation and significantly strengthened background checks appeared to lose political momentum. As lawmakers filtered back to the Senate and the House, to what many appeared to view as an unwelcome new debate about guns, it became clear that political realities on the Second Amendment were as locked in as ever. There is plenty of talk about serious action, notably from President Donald Trump, who promised to ""turn our grief into action."" But there was even more evidence that the political constraints that have frozen the gun debate remain as strong as ever. And experience shows that however deep the pain and the shock of a mass shooting, the more time that passes without serious action, the less likely a significant change in gun laws becomes. Trump vows there will be action Still, Trump promised that if the Congress did not act, he would, pledging to outlaw bump fire stocks , the devices that can make semiautomatic weapons replicate the rapid firing rate of machine guns. The move would have done nothing to stop the school tragedy -- though bump stocks were used by the shooter in the Las Vegas massacre last year. Trump called for steps to ""harden"" US schools to protect them from shooters, and he backed ""strong"" background checks to stop a ""sicko"" getting a gun. He seemed to be ready to fight the NRA. But he also revealed he had lunch with NRA chief Wayne LaPierre on Sunday, who launched a diatribe last week accusing those who want gun control of plotting a socialist takeover. A GOP source close to the White House told CNN's Pamela Brown that Trump was ""extremely anxious"" to get something done and expected to see some action in the next few weeks. The White House is looking at expanding background checks to sales at gun shows and at making them more ""efficient,"" and is also looking to include private transactions, the source said. If Trump can get that done he would win credit even from gun control advocates who want more done. But there must be extreme skepticism that any such move could make it through Congress, where pro-Second Amendment Republicans dominate. The source also said it would be much longer before there is action on another idea Trump raised last week but has since stopped talking about in public: raising the age that someone can buy a long gun from 18 to 21. A key GOP congressional source told CNN's Jim Acosta on Monday night that the President was ""moving back"" from upping the age requirement. Given the paucity of details from Trump and the sometimes contradictory nature of his remarks, it did not immediately appear that he was about to offer the crusading style of leadership that would be needed to grant his fellow Republicans political cover to jolt Congress into significant action. In fact, he distracted from the debate when he predicted that he, unlike one sheriff's deputy in Broward County, would have run into the school even without a gun to rescue kids. And he repeatedly called for the return of mental institutions so authorities could ""nab somebody"" who might carry out a mass shooting, an idea that enjoys little political support on Capitol Hill. Congress signals more of the same gridlock Still, the White House did announce that Trump would meet lawmakers on Wednesday to try to forge a way forward. Meetings of Republican caucus members on Tuesday will be closely watched to see whether there is any change in the weather on guns. But early evidence on Capitol Hill suggests it will be tough to pass anything much stronger than a bill known as Fix NICS, which would require states and agencies to do more to include records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Even an attempt to bring up that bill with dispatch failed when Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, blocked a bid by GOP leadership to pass it without debate. That measure is far short of the call for ""universal"" background checks on gun purchases demanded by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Anything less than that bill, the New York Democrat said, would be an ""abject failure and dereliction of duty"" in the wake of the Florida killings. But top Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas suggested that universal background checks would not be legislatively possible. ""I'm for doing what's achievable,"" he said. ""If they want to get bogged down again and do nothing, to me that's unacceptable."" Although Schumer is calling for more action, he gave no sign Monday that he is ready to expose his corps of the 10 senators in Trump-won states up for re-election this year to tough votes on measures that would ban assault-style weapons, a plan backed by some more liberal members of the Senate. Some Republicans signaled, meanwhile, that hopes of rising the required age for purchasing long guns and even banning bump stocks probably will not fly. ""I'm not very enthused about those,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he was not minded to deprive 18-, 19- or 20-year-olds of their constitutional rights to bear arms unless they were convicted felons or mentally ill. ""I don't think we need more gun control,"" he said. ""I think we need better idiot control."" But Sens. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican, and Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, tried to forge a way forward for their bill on universal background checks that failed to pass in 2013, after the Sandy Hook school massacre. Manchin expressed hope that the fact that a Republican now lived in the White House could reassure some GOP lawmakers. ""The reason we were not able to get the support we needed was because they were afraid President Obama would go further. Well, they're not having that fear with President Trump,"" Manchin said. ""It's really up to him.""",Donald Trump Barack Obama Brett Kavanaugh John McCain Republican Party United States Senate United States Congress Journalist Democratic Party Election,"Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, on Capitol Hill on Sunday.","(CNN) For 12 grief soaked days, it felt like something was different this time, that the massacre of 17 people at a Florida school and the activism of teenagers who survived it would force a rethinking of America's relationship with guns.

But the tragic shooting at a country festival in Las Vegas, which left 59 people dead, has prompted Tim McGraw and Faith Hill to speak out about gun control. In an interview with Billboard conducted less than two weeks after the shooting, McGraw and Hill said they support ""common sense"" gun control laws, and don't want military-grade weapons in the hands of civilians. (Shooter Stephen Paddock reportedly had AR-15-style assault rifles in his hotel room, plus ""bump stock"" devices that let a semi-automatic weapon fire like a fully automatic one.) McGraw explains that his stance doesn't mean he doesn't support Americans' right to bear arms. ""Look, I'm a bird hunter-I love to wing-shoot. However, there is some common sense that's necessary when it comes to gun control,"" McGraw said. ""They want to make it about the Second Amendment every time it's brought up. It's not about the Second Amendment."" Hill adds that she, along with other members of the country music community, felt especially close to the Las Vegas attack, and for her, it clarified the type of gun control she supports: making it harder for everyday people to buy military-grade guns. ""In reference to the tragedy in Las Vegas, we knew a lot of people there. The doctors that [treated] the wounded, they saw wounds like you'd see in war. That's not right,"" Hill said. ""Military weapons should not be in the hands of civilians. It's everyone's responsibility, including the government and the National Rifle Association, to tell the truth.

The day before, North had repeated that phrase, almost verbatim, while discussing the Iran nuclear deal on “Fox & Friends” in the hours before Trump announced America’s withdrawal from the accord. “The Iranians have been lying. Every time their lips move, they’re lying,” North said, suggesting that Iran had not abandoned its nuclear ambitions despite the agreement. He added that Trump should sanction anyone who does business with Iran going forward. “If we sanction [Iran] again, we ought to sanction anybody else who does business with them,” North said. “That’ll stop the Euros from helping to bail them out while they cheat on this program.” U.S. allies France, Germany and Britain have not withdrawn from the deal. On Wednesday, France’s foreign secretary, Jean-Yves Le Drian, described Trump’s decision to leave the accord as “isolationist, protectionist and unilateral.” North, who was announced as the NRA’s president on Monday, has a controversial history with Iran. While serving on the National Security Council during the Reagan administration, North played a key role in spearheading the clandestine sale of weapons to Iran in a bid to secure the release of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon and then using the proceeds from the weapon sales to fund the anti-revolutionary Contra rebels in Nicaragua ― even though Congress had banned such support. Story continues North was later found guilty of lying to Congress about the affair, shredding government documents and receiving an illegal gratuity. His convictions were overturned on appeal in 1991. During his interview of North on Wednesday, Hannity appeared to allude to the NRA president’s murky past while discussing the release this week of three American hostages from North Korea. “You know a thing or two about the release of hostages,” the host said. “Boy,” North responded, appearing to concur.

But in California, which already enforces some of the nation’s most restrictive gun laws, there is a movement underway against the unfettered sale of bullets. Gun control advocates here have pushed to limit internet sales, ban large-capacity magazines, require sellers to have licenses, raise taxes on bullets, and mandate serial numbers or other traceable markings on ammunition so that the police can more easily track them. Such regulations, several of which have been enacted and take effect this year and next, are inspired by the view that the best way to limit gun violence is to approach it as a “bullet control” problem. As Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York, told the Senate 25 years ago, when he introduced legislation that would have imposed a 10,000-percent tax on hollow-tip ammunition, “guns don’t kill people; bullets do.” Across the country, bullets remain subject to far fewer federal restrictions than the weapons that fire them. Purchasing ammunition typically requires no form of identification, is handed over with no questions asked and, in most of the country, can be ordered online and delivered to doorsteps. In contrast, gun dealers have to keep detailed sales records of firearms and generally have to be licensed. If someone buys more than one handgun, the purchase is reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Gun buyers usually have to pass background checks.",Bullet Gun Ammunition Rifle Gun violence Caliber Firearm Guns & Ammo Gun control M&J Gun Trade,"A gun shop in Oakland, Calif.","SACRAMENTO — Sold from vending machines in Pennsylvania, feed depots in Nevada, pharmacies in Georgia and jewelry stores in Texas, ammunition is in many states easier to buy than cold medicine.

(Photo: Boston Globe via Getty Images) Members of the Trump administration are visiting a school in Arkansas on Wednesday where at least two school administrators are trained to use and carry guns on campus, according to Arkansas outlet The Sentinel-Record. The visit is part of the administration’s monthslong effort to learn more about ways of keeping schools safe in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Secretary of Education Mick Zais will be visiting Lake Hamilton High School. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos was initially scheduled to attend as well but canceled, according to the Sentinel-Record. Sessions is making the stop as part of the Federal Commission on School Safety, which was created in March and is chaired by DeVos. The commission is tasked with making recommendations for school violence prevention. Throughout the spring and summer, members have visited schools and met with education stakeholders for input. Lake Hamilton School District has an unusual approach to school safety. For decades the school has trained a few select school administrators as security and kept guns on campus for them to use in case of an emergency, according to an Associated Press article from 2013. The practice got the district in legal trouble in 2013, with state leaders saying Lake Hamilton and school districts were misinterpreting state rules that banned guns on school campuses except for private security companies. The law eventually changed and Lake Hamilton continued the practice. Today, two of the school’s administrators have access to the firearms, which are kept in a secret location, Lake Hamilton Superintendent Steve Anderson told The Sentinel-Record. In addition, the district employs two armed officers. “Right now we have a mechanism in place that has worked and has worked under your guidelines for 20 years without any problem,” Anderson said in 2013, per the AP. School district officials declined to comment or provide further details to HuffPost on the school’s safety plan prior to the visit. The visit comes amid questions over how the commission will address the role of guns in school shootings. While a March announcement from the Trump administration said the commission will look at and make recommendations regarding “age restrictions for certain firearm purchases,” months later, DeVos told a Senate subcommittee that the commission will not look at the role firearms play in school shootings. Previously, Trump has suggested schools should arm teachers. The idea has been widely panned by education advocates, including school law enforcement officers. Other groups have emphasized the importance of focusing on counseling and mental health support for students. Instead of acting as school security guards, “educators should educate,” said Noelle Ellerson Ng, associate executive director for policy and advocacy at The School Superintendents Association. The group will “always defer to state and local education leaders making the decision right for their district,” Ng says, but it does not support the idea of arming teachers, especially if it is prioritized over investments in social-emotional supports. Local activists plan to protest Sessions’ visit to the school. Ashley Hurst of Arkansas, who organized the protest, said she is concerned the state’s local school safety commission has not focused on gun control and she is worried they will recommend the arming of teachers. “You start to lose the battle when you put guns in schools,” Hurst said.

The shooting was carried out by O’Neal’s ex-fiancé, Juan Lopez, whom she broke off an engagement with in September. Witnesses reported seeing the two arguing before Lopez shot O’Neal several times and then ran into the hospital and continued shooting. Another two victims were fatally shot inside, a pharmacy first-year resident and a Chicago police officer. The shooting of O’Neal, in the hospital where she worked, is particularly painful for the medical community, falling in the midst of a moment when doctors are actively galvanizing against the National Rifle Association with the hashtag #ThisIsOurLane. For many, the timing was impossible not to mention. “Are you really still asking if @ThisIsOurLane,” tweeted Joseph Sakran, a trauma surgeon at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “It isn’t the first time this kind of violence was brought, literally, to our doorstep, claiming one of our own,” tweeted Michael Gonzalez, MD. “Shouldn’t it be the last?” I’m with @darakass.

The attorney who represented a woman who was harassed by alleged Maryland newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos from 2009 to 2011 described him as a ""dangerous person."" Nearly seven years ago, Ramos pleaded guilty to a criminal harassment charge, court documents filed in the District Court of Maryland in Anne Arundel County show. Ramos, now 38, had befriended the woman on Facebook in 2009 and used information he gathered from the social media platform to attack her, Brennan McCarthy told ABC News. ""He would tell her to do things like hang herself,"" McCarthy said. ""He wrote a letter to her [employer] stating that they should fire her because she's a 'bipolar drunkard.' He did terrible things to this woman."" On Thursday, Ramos allegedly entered 888 Bestgate Road, the building that houses the newsroom for the Capital Gazette, and opened fire on employees for the local newspaper, killing five people, according to the Anne Arundel Police Department. The 888 Bestgate Road building is seen after police received reports of multiple people being shot at The Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Md., June 28, 2018. Jose Luis Magana/AP In 2012, Ramos had filed a defamation lawsuit against the Capital Gazette following a story about the harassment case, former editor and publisher Tom Marquardt told ABC News. The article, which was written in 2011, stated that Ramos had reached out to a former high school classmate on Facebook, asking for help because he was having some issues. The woman, who was not named in the story, tried to help and suggested that he seek counseling. ""That sparked months of emails in which Ramos alternately asked for help, called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself,"" the article said. Jarrod Ramos, 38, of Laurel, Maryland, is seen in this undated mug shot. Anne Arundel Police A judge placed Ramos on 18 months of supervised probation and ordered him to continue therapy and refrain from any further contact with the woman or her family, the court documents show. Ramos claimed he was defamed in the lawsuit against the Capital Gazette, which named Marquardt as well as the reporter who wrote it. A few months later, Ramos filed another complaint that added a charge of invasion of privacy. The case was ultimately dismissed. Marquardt had once received a death threat from Ramos and alerted authorities, but there was not enough evidence to file charges against him, he said. McCarthy described Ramos as ""incredibly angry."" ""The malice dripped off this man in court,"" he said. McCarthy was so affected by Ramos that he began to fear for his own life as well. Brennan McCarthy, the attorney who represented a woman who Maryland shooting suspect Jarrod Ramos had stalked from 2009 to 2011, described him to ABC News as a ""dangerous person."" ABC News After McCarthy got a second protective order for his client and agreed to accept all pleadings and correspondence on her behalf, Ramos allegedly began to harass him too. ""He then started stalking me, my Facebook feed, my own personal things,"" he said. ""...I have no doubt that he was on my street, and it was a very scary situation."" Each morning when he wakes up, McCarthy says se looks out the window to make sure Ramos isn't near his home. He still does it to this day, as does the woman he stalked, he said. ""He left that sort of impression on me,"" he said. ""This is a very dangerous person."" Steve Schuh, county executive of Anne Arundel County, holds a copy of The Capital Gazette near the scene of a shooting at the newspaper's office, June 29, 2018, in Annapolis, Md. Patrick Semansky/AP McCarthy also said that Ramos was ""smart enough to walk the edge so that he did not quite violate the law."" ""He would say things, like, for instance, 'Mr. McCarthy, wouldn't it be so sad if you were to be run over today and die bleeding in your own driveway, and if, perhaps, I might have been in the truck?' It's not a direct threat. It's a referential threat.'"" The woman whom Ramos stalked was so frightened by him that when she left the state, she didn't leave a forwarding address, and she alerted the local sheriff's office to Ramos in case he went looking for her, McCarthy said. ""She still has her gun,"" he said. ""...She's still scared."" Police stand watch outside the Robert F. Sweeney District Court in Annapolis, Maryland, on June 29, 2018, where suspected shooter Jarrod Ramos is expected to appear for a bond hearing. Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images As soon as McCarthy heard the news about the shooting at the Capital Gazette, he ""knew immediately that it was Jarrod Ramos,"" he said.

Phil Bredesen in his run for a U.S. Senate seat referred to “white male” gun owners as ""Murican gun nuts"" in response to a Facebook post asking people to identify “the biggest terrorist organization on the planet,” according to a report. Mark Brown, communications director for Tennessee Victory 2018, a group backing Bredesen's run against Republican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn for the Senate seat occupied by retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker, posted the comment in 2015, the Washington Free Beacon reported. Brown's comment attracted zero likes, according to the report. It was not the first time Brown made incendiary comments about Republicans. TOP TENNESSEE DEM PARTY OFFICIAL SNUBS ‘REACHING OUT’ TO TRUMP VOTERS, CALLS THEM ‘IDIOTS’ In a July 31, 2017 post, Brown allegedly wrote, “Exactly, f--- “reaching out” to Trump voters. The idiots aren’t listening.” In other posts, he has referred to President Trump as “Putin’s b---h,” “racist,” a “f---stik,” an “insane f---,” and a “F---ing moron.” Brown’s brazen approach is at odds with Bredesen, who has painted himself as a moderate willing to reach across the aisle. Bredesen broke with his party during the controversy surrounding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault during his Senate confirmation hearings. In a TV interview, Bredesen said he would have supported Kavanaugh’s nomination if he were a senator because the allegations lacked sufficient evidence. TAYLOR SWIFT SUPPORTS DEMOCRAT WHO BROKE FROM PARTY ON KAVANAUGH IN RARE POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT Those comments lost him the support of two prominent Democratic groups, MoveOn and Priorities USA. But Bredesen has attracted the support of pop singer Taylor Swift, who sharply criticized the GOP's Blackburn in an online post that preceded a sharp rise in voter registrations in the state. However, a new New York Times poll on Friday showed Blackburn leading Bredesen by 14 points. In a recent campaign ad, the former governor referred to himself as a “lifelong gun owner” and a supporter of Second Amendment gun rights. “As governor, I had an A rating from the NRA,” Bredesen said. But the National Rifle Association called Bredesen’s ad “false” and “misleading.” “Phil Bredesen is a ‘D’ rated candidate, and he will not protect our constitutional rights in Washington, D.C.,” said Chris W. Cox, chairman of the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, in a statement. Bredesen has not publicly addressed Brown’s comments. In recent weeks the Senate candidate appeared at fundraiser that headlined ex-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a staunch supporter of gun control. Earlier in the campaign, Bredesen denounced Vice President Mike Pence’s “name-calling” because he endorsed Blackburn, and called him a “liberal.” On Wednesday, Bredesen and Blackburn exchanged barbs in their second and final debate ahead of the November midterms. The outcome of the competitive red-state has attracted nationwide attention due to a 51-49 Republican majority at stake.

465,100080,http://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-armed-guard-synagogue-003810111.html,"Trump Offers Call for Unity After Shooting, Pivots to Rally Mode","""Trump Says Armed Guard in Synagogue May Have Changed Outcome (Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump condemned 'all forms of evil,' including anti-Semitism, after a mass shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh left 11 people dead in what’s being investigated as a hate crime. 'We mourn for the unthinkable loss of life that took place today,' the president told a gathering of young farmers in Indianapolis, pledging the full resources of his administration to investigate the crime. 'Our nation and the world are shocked.' Trump pressed ahead with a campaign rally in southern Illinois Saturday night, where his roughly 70-minute remarks were more sotto voce than usual. He veered little from his usual script, though, of attacking Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Maxine Waters of California. 'If you don’t mind, I’m going to tone it down a little bit, do you mind?' Trump asked the crowd assembled at an airport hanger at Southern Illinois Airport. It’s time, said Trump, to 'renew the bonds of love and loyalty that sustain us as Americans.' Barnstorming in an effort to hold on to Republican majorities in Congress in the Nov. 6 midterms, the president has eight or more rallies planned, from Florida to Montana, over the next week. He said Saturday he would also go to Pittsburgh in the wake of the shooting. Earlier, before boarding Air Force One, Trump said the Pittsburgh incident may have ended differently had there been armed personnel inside the synagogue. The comment could reopen a bitter debate over gun-control laws and the political influence of the National Rifle Association, less than two weeks from midterm elections. 'If they had some kind of a protection inside the temple maybe it could have been a very much different situation,' Trump said, adding that the U.S. should 'stiffen up' its death penalty laws. Earlier, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the Department of Justice will file hate crimes and other charges against the defendant, including ones that could lead to the death penalty. History of Shootings 'We believe this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States,' the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights group, said in a statement. Trump joined his daughter Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism upon her marriage, and Vice President Mike Pence in condemning anti-Semitism. He told reporters on Air Force One that he’d spoken to the mayor of Pittsburgh, to Tom Wolf, Pennsylvania’s governor, and to his daughter and her husband Jared Kushner about the shooting. Places of worship, from churches to a Sikh temple, have been common sites of fatal shootings in the U.S. That includes the 2017 shooting at First Baptist Sutherland Springs in Texas that left 26 dead, and the murder of nine parishioners, all black, at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Colombia, South Carolina, in 2015. Meanwhile, a movement to arm teachers took root earlier this year after the massacre of 17 students and staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. 'It hurts every time I see these headlines and then the political inaction,' David Hogg, a Stoneman student who’s become a gun-control advocate, said on Twitter. 'Squirrel Hill my heart is with you. We will fight for you every single day.' The president is receiving regular updates on the shooting and its aftermath from Mike Burnett, senior director for counter-terrorism, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. A suspect, Robert Bowers, 46, surrendered and was in custody. Bowers entered the synagogue armed with a high-powered rifle and at least three handguns, Bob Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh field office, said at a press briefing. ‘I’m Going In’ The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights legal advocacy group, produced a Twitter message from an account with the name Robert Bowers blaming HIAS, a Jewish nonprofit agency that helps resettle refugees, for bringing 'invaders in that kill our people,' adding, 'Screw your optics. I’m going in.' Officials haven’t yet said whether or not there was armed security at the Tree of Life Congregation, located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from downtown. Many Jewish houses of worship and community centers in the U.S. have boosted security in recent years in response to attacks or threats. Jones, who’s been with the Bureau since 1996, termed the crime scene the worst he’d seen. The FBI will be taking the lead as the investigation continues. U.S. and foreign leaders decried the shooting. Israeli Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video message that he 'was heartbroken and appalled.' Officials from Netanyahu’s administration are headed to Pittsburgh. Former President Barack Obama, who spent eight years as griever-in-chief through a string of grisly mass shootings, said on Twitter that the U.S. needs to both fight the rise of anti-Semitism and consider new actions on guns. 'There is no place in our society for violence against innocent people, especially violence motivated by race, religion, or sex,' Norm Coleman, a former U.S. senator from Minnesota who chairs the Republican Jewish Coalition, said in a statement. 'The level of hate in this country is out of control.' The Simon Wiesenthal Center called on Trump to show leadership in fighting extremism in the U.S. 'We urge President Trump to immediately convene an emergency meeting of religious leaders to help stop the slide to extremism in American Society,' Rabbi Marvin Hier and Abraham Cooper, dean and associate dean, said in a statement released Saturday night in Vienna. With U.S. elections looming on Nov. 6, Saturday’s incident comes a day after a Florida man was arrested and charged in connection with mailing at least 13 suspected explosive devices that targeted high-profile Democrats including Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Jewish billionaire-philanthropist George Soros, and the cable network CNN. --With assistance from Jenny Leonard.

That may have prevented a school shooting,"(CNN) Koeberle Bull got on Facebook and saw several racist, cruel messages that used the N-word and wished death on her three African-American children. She didn't know the white man who had messaged her -- she lives in New Jersey, and he appeared to live in Kentucky -- but he had a gun in his profile photo, so she decided to call police in Kentucky and report him. ""I was in shock, I was disgusted, I was angry and hurt,"" Bull said. Little did Bull know that her call, and a follow-up police investigation, prevented what police say could have been a mass tragedy. On Thursday, after speaking with Bull, Kentucky State Police went to interview Dylan Jarrell, the Lawrenceburg man who allegedly messaged her. Police say they found him backing out of the driveway with a firearm, a collection of ammo, a Kevlar vest and a detailed plan to attack local schools. ""This young man had it in his mind to go to schools and create havoc,"" state Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said. ""He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary, and the only thing that stood between him and evil -- between him in a school doing evil -- was law enforcement."" These harassing messages led Koeberle Bull to call police. Jarrell, 21, was arrested and charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications, police said. His public defender, Amy Robertson, would not comment on the specifics of the allegations. ""These cases are very complex and often have many sides to them. It is not uncommon for it to take a long time for all the facts to come out,"" Robertson said. ""I ask that you not jump to any conclusions and give me time to do my job."" Questioned over alleged threats to a school Police said they found evidence of a ""credible and imminent threat"" to nearby Shelby and Anderson County schools. Authorities said they obtained a search warrant for Jarrell's home and electronic devices. Jarrell's internet history included a search for how to carry out a school shooting, police said, and the FBI questioned him in May over social media threats to a school in Tennessee. Kentucky State Police said Jarrell had more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a 100-round high capacity magazine and a detailed plan of attack. There may be additional charges, Sanders said. Court records indicate Jarrell was arraigned Monday and entered a not guilty plea with Robertson. His bond was set at $50,000. Jarrell is being held at the Shelby County Detention Center and has a preliminary hearing in Anderson County scheduled for November 1, according to court records. 'I didn't know what he was capable of' Police say Dylan Jarrell had a weapon, ammo and a detailed plan to attack Kentucky schools. Before she called police, Bull posted a screen grab of the racist message on Facebook. ""Anyone who thinks racism doesn't exist, this is what I woke up to in my inbox this morning,"" she said in her post. ""Let's share this and make this guy famous please."" She tried to message Jarrell but he had blocked her, she said. With help from her friends she was able to find him and call police -- first in her hometown and then in Kentucky. Now, days later, Bull's Facebook page is full of messages of praise, thanking her for preventing what could have been a tragedy. ""People are reaching out and calling me a hero and calling me a guardian angel, but I was just being a mom,"" she said. ""I was just being a mom who wanted to protect her kids."" As a precautionary measure, Anderson County Schools were closed on October 19, and Shelby County Public Schools suspended activities at Shelby County High School, too. On the Anderson County Schools website , officials thanked security officials and first responders ""who eliminated a threat to AC students and staff, worked countless, tireless hours to ensure our safety and humbly take no credit for their heroic actions."" At a press conference, Sanders thanked Trooper Josh Satterly, a ""humble, dedicated trooper"" who took Bull's report and followed up with other agencies to investigate. Bull said she is grateful that Satterly validated her concerns, despite her suspicion that her call would lead nowhere. ""I thought, 'they're not gonna care about my three black kids from New Jersey,' and this community genuinely did care about my kids,"" she said. ""If you see something, say something -- I never took that as seriously as I do now, and now I know that it matters,"" she said.

Now a Los Angeles councilman is trying to make it a misdemeanor to download those blueprints. Under a proposal introduced Friday by Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch Englander, Angelenos could be barred from possessing or transferring the blueprints for a 3-D-printed gun, as well as the weapons themselves. Englander also wants L.A. to prod the state to make possessing such guns or blueprints a felony across California. Englander told reporters he was worried that as 3-D printing technology evolves and becomes more widely accessible, “you can go to the store tomorrow, buy a 3-D printer, and have a gun printed at home today — no waiting period, no serial number. Advertisement “That’s very dangerous to society,” the councilman said. Critics fear that access to such blueprints will ease the way for people to make firearms that lack serial numbers, skirting licensing requirements and making them untraceable to police. Such guns are typically made of hard plastic, raising concerns that they could be carried through metal detectors and onto planes. Some gun rights advocates have countered that citizens should have the freedom to access the blueprints. “Why wouldn’t the Second Amendment protect the right of a law-abiding citizen to make his or her own weapons?” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said in a statement earlier this week. Gun rights groups have also stressed that undetectable weapons already are targeted by existing laws. Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Assn. Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement Tuesday that “regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years.” Advertisement Englander said that people have gotten around a California law requiring a stainless steel component in such guns by making the metal piece a removable, “non-essential” component. He argued that by targeting the digital files to make such guns, his proposal would give law enforcement a new tool to try to prevent their spread. The debate has been thrust into the headlines by a legal battle involving Austin, Texas, resident Cody Wilson, founder of digital firearm blueprint developer Defense Distributed, who reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department allowing him to put the blueprints online. Earlier this week, a federal judge issued an order to temporarily stop the public from accessing the files, in reaction to a lawsuit from the attorneys general of multiple states. California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra announced Thursday that the state was joining that suit, led by Washington state, to block the release of the files. “Why would anyone increase the burden on law enforcement and sabotage its ability to keep American communities safe?” Becerra said in a statement. Advertisement It is already possible to construct a gun at home, even without an expensive 3-D printer. Los Angeles authorities say that as it becomes harder to get firearms, gangs increasingly are turning to homemade guns built from parts purchased over the internet, dubbed “ghost guns” because they lack serial numbers. Becerra cautioned Californians this week that if they make their own guns, they must be eligible to legally own or possess a firearm, include design features required under state law, and apply to the California Department of Justice for a unique firearm serial number and place it on the weapon. Englander said Friday that while it already is possible to make a gun at home, he was concerned that as technology makes it easier, “people may just do it to see if it works,” regardless of their age, criminal history or mental health — and without following those state rules. Chuck Michel, president and general counsel of the California Rifle & Pistol Assn., derided that idea. Advertisement “An incredible amount of disinformation is being used to justify this kind of hysterical overreaction,” Michel said in an email reacting to the new proposal. Guns made of printed parts are “crude, unreliable, and short-lived. Bad guys are better off continuing to steal guns, or make equally crude firearms with parts from Home Depot.” The Los Angeles City Council has backed gun control measures in the past, including requiring Angelenos to lock up or disable their handguns at home if the guns aren’t close at hand. In March, Councilman Mitch O’Farrell said he wanted the city to cut ties with companies that are linked to the NRA, a proposal that has yet to move forward.

This decision would allow individuals with dangerous histories to access online blueprints, evade state and federal gun laws and print an untraceable weapon without even obtaining a background check. Many of these downloadable guns would circumvent the federal law banning plastic guns and can be printed entirely in plastic. As a former Chief of U.S. Capitol Police and Senate Sergeant at Arms, I know that a failure to permanently stop downloadable guns will increase the challenges of protecting the security of members of Congress, their staff and visitors to the Capitol. To enter a building on the Capitol complex, visitors and staff must pass through a screening checkpoint run by Capitol Police. Any kind of deadly weapon — including guns — is prohibited in the complex to ensure that members can conduct their official business without the threat of violence from those who might wish to do them harm. Unfortunately, even the most technologically advanced security cannot neutralize all possible threats Rising threat level from plastic guns Last week, the Capitol community paused in a moment of silence to recognize the lives of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut, who were killed by a deranged gunman in 1998. That shooting changed security at the Capitol forever, but it hasn’t stopped the threats to members and visitors. Last month, we recognized the one-year mark of the congressional baseball practice shooting in Alexandria, Virginia, where members, staff, and friends were shot and injured. Two years ago, another individual brandished a BB gun in the Capitol Visitor Center full of tourists. The Capitol Police is constantly re-evaluating the threats facing the Capitol and the people it protects. But it’s difficult to imagine how much worse these threats would be if plastic firearms were readily available. More:De(ja)Vos: Education chief's decision to ignore guns' role in shootings echoes Bush debacle Would the Founders want our kids to die in school shootings like Santa Fe? I doubt it. On guns, we're as paralyzed as I was the day my nephew was shot: Montana governor Last weekend, because of special treatment from the State Department, a Texas company made downloadable instructions for 3D printing firearms readily available online. Anyone with access to a computer, an internet connection, and a capable 3D printer — including terrorists, felons, and others with dangerous histories — was able to make a variety of untraceable handguns, rifles, and assault weapons. This type of capability increases the challenges for law enforcement, especially at the Capitol. We already have a wealth of intelligence that shows terrorists want to inflict at least symbolic damage to the Capitol because it represents freedom and American democracy. Just last year, an Islamic State propaganda magazine stressed the use of easily available guns in the U.S. to commit terrorist acts. With widely available downloadable instructions, the ingenuity of potential offenders who wish to do harm at the Capitol will challenge the technology of detection and defense, even in a secure facility protected by Capitol Police. 3D guns are a unique threat to our leaders While I strongly support the Second Amendment and appreciate the fundamental right of American citizens to keep and bear arms, our elected leaders must recognize the unique threat downloadable firearms pose to public safety. Protecting visitors, staff, and members in the Capitol from harm is an obligation not just for Capitol Police, but it is a responsibility for all of our elected officials. On Tuesday night, a federal court in Washington State issued a nationwide order that temporarily stopped the company’s publication of the blueprints online. But this injunction only lasts until Aug. 10. We can sit by and wait for Aug. 11 to end up in the same place as we were before the courts rightfully stepped in. Or, our leaders can permanently stop downloadable guns before tragedy strikes. President Trump’s State Department must reverse the temporary modification to the United States Munitions List and withdraw the special exemption granted to the company immediately. And as the State Department finalizes a proposed rule about exporting guns that have already been built by manufacturers, it must keep gun schematics on the U.S. Munitions List and continue prohibiting the posting of these blueprints online. Congress does not need to wait for the State Department and should pass legislation that will stop downloadable guns from being available online. Protecting the Capitol is not a partisan issue and I urge all members to support common sense proposals that will keep us safe. Inaction on this important issue of public safety and national security is unacceptable.

Jason Dearen, Allen Breed and Tamara Lush Associated Press Florida's child welfare agency investigated the suspect in a school shooting that killed 17 people after he cut himself in a video but found him stable, according to state records. The Miami Herald obtained records from Florida's Department of Children and Families and reported Saturday that Nikolas Cruz posted a video on the social media network Snapchat showing him cutting his arms in 2016. The agency was called to investigate. Cruz, then 18, was listed as an ""alleged victim"" of medical neglect and inadequate supervision; his adoptive mother, then-68-year-old Lynda Cruz, the ""alleged perpetrator."" ""Mr. Cruz was on Snapchat cutting both of his arms,"" the Florida DCF abuse hotline was told in August 2016. ""Mr. Cruz has fresh cuts on both his arms. Mr. Cruz stated he plans to go out and buy a gun."" According to the paper, DCF's investigation was completed that Nov. 12. The agency concluded that Cruz had not been mistreated by his mother, was receiving adequate care from a mental health counselor and was attending school. ""Henderson came out and assessed the (victim and) found him to be stable enough not to be hospitalized,"" the DCF report said. Cruz had been diagnosed with autism, a neurological disorder that often leads to social awkwardness and isolation, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. The documents provide further evidence that Cruz was a troubled teen before being charged with 17 counts of murder in the Wednesday attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School . On Friday, President Donald Trump visited Broward Health North Hospital, where he saw two victims and praised the doctors and nurses for their ""incredible"" job. With first lady Melania Trump, he also paid his respects to law enforcement officials in Fort Lauderdale, telling officers he hoped they were ""getting the credit"" they deserved. Asked if he'd talked with victims, Trump added: ""I did, indeed, and it's very sad something like that could happen."" Trump is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, about 40 miles (65 kilometers) from the shooting scene. Also Friday, an activist and teacher who wants gun control laws was removed from a Miami-area GOP fundraiser after confronting House Speaker Paul Ryan about this week's mass shooting. The Miami Herald reports that Maria Thorne, a Key Biscayne fifth-grade teacher, said she and a friend dropped in on the fundraiser at the Ritz Hotel after she noticed motorcade traffic clogging up her commute home. Thorne said she shook Ryan's hand and introduced herself but added, ""You're here celebrating the death of 17 children."" She said Ryan told her he ""didn't want to talk politics"" or argue. When Thorne tried to continue, security escorted her out as she chanted ""No more guns!"" The National Republican Congressional Committee lists a 2018 Winter Meeting in Key Biscayne this weekend. Ryan's spokesperson confirmed to the Herald that he attended it. More funerals were scheduled for Saturday. As families buried their dead, authorities questioned whether they could have prevented the attack The FBI said it received a tip last month that Cruz had a ""desire to kill"" and access to guns and could be plotting an attack, but agents failed to investigate. The governor called for the FBI director to resign. A person close to Cruz called the FBI's tip line on Jan. 5 and provided information about Cruz's weapons and his erratic behavior, including his disturbing social media posts. The caller was concerned that Cruz could attack a school. In a statement, the agency acknowledged that the tip should have been shared with the FBI's Miami office and investigated, but it was not. The startling admission came as the agency was already facing criticism for its treatment of a tip about a YouTube comment posted last year. The comment posted by a ""Nikolas Cruz"" said, ""Im going to be a professional school shooter."" The FBI investigated the remark but did not determine who made it. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the shooting that killed 17 people Wednesday was a ""tragic consequence"" of the FBI's missteps and ordered a review of the Justice Department's processes. He said it's now clear that the nation's premier law enforcement agency missed warning signs.

What restraining order? After a Seattle judge told Defense Distributed to stop publishing the schematic files for 3D-printed firearms, gun rights activists simply started distributing the files from another website. Nobody should be surprised about this. It’s happened before, and it’s impossible to stop. Rewind to 2013, when Defense Distributed’s Cody Wilson first showed off his 3D-printed weapon. The State Department quickly shut him down, on the basis that he was violating arms export controls—this is the stance the government abandoned in a settlement that allowed Wilson to resume publication of the files on Wednesday, prompting the temporary restraining order. When the State Department originally clamped down, Wilson stopped publishing the files, but other sites—The Pirate Bay and other file-sharing services—immediately stepped in to keep the distribution flowing. So, over the subsequent five years, the files have never been out of circulation (even if the products they create are incredibly dangerous for the shooter, as well as those around them, due to materials quality issues). That fact isn’t stopping the furious legal battle we’re seeing today, though, because for both sides this is about making a stand. “I am thankful and relieved Judge Lasnik put a nationwide stop to the Trump Administration’s dangerous decision to allow downloadable, 3D-printed ghost guns to be distributed online,” Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson said Tuesday, when he won the temporary restraining order. “These ghost guns are untraceable, virtually undetectable and, without today’s victory, available to any felon, domestic abuser or terrorist.” For the other side, the fight is about upholding a First-and-Second-Amendments sandwich. “Our Constitution’s First Amendment secures the right of all people to engage in truthful speech, including by sharing information contained in books, paintings, and files. Indeed, freedom of speech is a bedrock principle of our United States and a cornerstone of our democratic Republic,” the activists wrote on their new site, which we’re not linking to here, even though you can easily find it. Story continues “Through [site name redacted], we intend to encourage people to consider new and different aspects of our nation’s marketplace of ideas—even if some government officials disagree with our views or dislike our content—because information is code, code is free speech, and free speech is freedom.” The question of whether code equates to speech is a complex one that’s never been decided by the Supreme Court. The idea has been promoted in the past by big tech companies, with some success—Google has managed to get courts to say that its search rankings enjoy free-speech protections, and Apple defended itself against the FBI’s demand that it create a special, law-enforcement-accessible version of its iPhone firmware by arguing this was a free-speech violation. It is certainly true that speech transmitted over digital media is necessarily encoded and decoded, making speech code. However, just because a square is a rectangle, that doesn’t mean all rectangles are squares. The problem with saying that all code is speech is that any virtual object, and any computer file for creating a physical thing, is based on code. In an increasingly digitized world, equating code with speech means it becomes effectively impossible to regulate things, or actions, or decisions in any way. For libertarians, this may be an optimal outcome; for people of a different philosophical and political persuasion, not so much. It is impossible to entirely stop code from being transmitted, as has been repeatedly proven with Defense Distributed’s gun files. However, there are plenty of digital files and activities that we rightly ban or regulate even though they cannot be 100% eliminated—child sexual abuse material, for example, or malicious hacking. The Seattle court will hold another hearing on the Defense Distributed case on August 10, to consider whether the temporary restraining order will be converted into a preliminary injunction. It will be interesting to see to what extent the judge takes into account the viability of enforcing such a measure effectively.",3D printed firearms 3D printing Defense Distributed Gun Firearm Printing Ghost gun Liberator Gun control AR-15 style rifle,A 3D-print gun used by the group Defense Districting.,"Restraining order?

Michigan Attorney General and GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Schuette signaled support for Trump’s recent calls to arm some teachers and other school officials with firearms as a way to deter possible mass shooters in the wake of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. “That is an option that ought to be considered,” Schuette said in an interview with ABC News last week, “If we have to work on having security officers in schools and or teachers that are specially trained, specially equipped, that's an option we ought to review.” Attorney General Bill Schuette announces an open and ongoing investigation into the systemic issues with sexual misconduct at Michigan State University that began in 2017, Jan. 27, 2018, at the G. Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich. Jake May/The Flint Journal-MLive.com via AP But support over this stance could depend on where in Michigan a voter lives. Data provided by the Michigan State Police showed that Michigan had 621,327 active concealed carry permits as of February 1, 2018, which amounts to roughly 8 percent of the state's adult population, according to an analysis by the local news outlet Michigan Live. In more rural counties in the northern part of the state, the percentage of the adult population with a hunting license is higher than 20 percent. In contrast the state's more urban areas like Detroit, a city that since 2006 has only seen one year where non-fatal shooting totaled below 1,000 according to data from the Detroit Police Department, see a much lower rate of concealed carry permits and hunting licenses. A supporter of Michigan's Open Carry law attends a rally and march, April 27, 2014, in Romulus, Mich. Bill Pugliano/Getty Images Just 2 percent of the adult population in Wayne County, which includes the city of Detroit, has a registered hunting license. In Ontonagon County, tucked in the far northwest corner of the state, 28 percent of the adult population has a registered hunting license. ""Michigan is a pretty diverse state in terms of comparing the Upper Peninsula to metro Detroit,"" Jennifer Carlson, a professor at the University of Arizona who has done extensive research on gun politics in Michigan and is the author of ""Citizen-Protectors: The Everyday Politics of Guns in an Age of Decline"" told ABC News in a phone interview. ""What is really fascinating about Michigan is that gun politics really comes down to the people that own guns and see guns as a meaningful part of their lives."" The deep divide in gun ownership in Michigan reflects a nation still deeply divided on a way forward to decrease mass shooting and gun violence. While some gun owners in the state may support laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill, there is still often a divide on how to actually implement policies to achieve that goal. ""In my conversations with gun carriers, overwhelmingly people support keeping guns out of the hands the ‘wrong hands,"" Carlson said, ""But that raises a whole different debate in terms of how do you decide who is a good guy with a gun versus a bad guy with a gun. That’s something that I think is really interesting about Michigan and I would argue is actually indicative about how Americans feel about guns."" Schuette's Republican opponents, Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley and state senator Patrick Colbeck, have both positioned themselves as strong defenders of the Second Amendment, with Colbeck supporting some trained officials to carry concealed weapons in schools. ""Laws restricting guns serve to empower people with criminal intent,"" Colbeck's Communications Director AnneMarie Schieber Dykstra wrote in an e-mail to ABC News, ""He believes a better approach is to protect students. He supports concealed pistol license holders to carry guns in schools and empowering school boards to build infrastructure to protect students such as safe rooms, security guards and metal detectors.""

Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley highlights the defense industry and its importance to Michigan's economy in a roundtable discussion at Genesee Packaging, Oct. 7, 2016 in Flint, Mich. Jake May/The Flint Journal-MLive.com via AP On the Democratic side, all of the major candidates have called for strengthening the background check system for gun purchases, and banning ""assault weapons"" like the firearm used in the Parkland shooting. ""A weapon of war does not belong in the hands of civilians,"" Shri Thandear, one of the candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, wrote in a statement provided to ABC News. Gretchen Whitmer, a former Democratic leader in the Michigan state Senate who is the front-runner in the Democratic primary, opposed a bill passed by the Michigan legislature that allows people to carry concealed guns in schools, bars, preschools, churches and other places, and spoke about a need to ""pass common sense gun laws"" to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. Whitmer has also spoken about the need to reform the mental health system in America if progress is going to be made in curtailing gun violence. ""It means addressing mental illness in this country so that anyone who is struggling can get help, and when someone's friends or family notice something is going on and they report it, we recognize those warning signs and we have the tools to take action,"" Whitmer said in a speech last December at a remembrance vigil for the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Michigan Senate Democratic Leader Gretchen Whitmer, foreground, addresses the media following a town hall meeting in Detroit, Oct. 12, 2014. Jose Juarez/AP Jenna Bednar, a political science professor at the University of Michigan, said that both parties are cognizant of the pitfalls of making guns a central issue in a state where the issue is so divisive. ""The Republicans, led by Schuette, have laid out a steady history of removing barriers to firearm purchase and use, so it would be difficult at this juncture for any candidate to pivot and support gun control,"" Bednar told ABC News, but cautioned that while Republicans may avoid the issue, the eventual Democratic nominee cannot alienate voters heading into the general election in November. ""Should [Whitmer] make it to the general, she'll need to attract the support of moderate Republican women,"" Bednar said, ""Support of moderate gun control, framed as school safety, could be a winning position for her; probably necessary in the primaries, and a useful way to distinguish herself from Schuette in the general election."" Schuette, who was endorsed by President Trump in a tweet last September, said that increased security at schools, a greater focus on reforming the mental health system in America, and a discussion on the “coarsening of society” all need to be part of the national conversation on gun control. “Too many video games with violence instead of having a conversation about our culture,” Schuette said, “Our airports are secure, why can't we do something to protect and enhance the security of our schools?” Alabama state Republican Senator Luther Strange, left, walks to embrace President Donald Trump during the senator's rally at the Von Braun Civic Center September 22, 2017 in Huntsville, Ala.

Speaking to a group of reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Trump referred to existing gun laws as “having little to do” with the shooting, in a video shared by CNN. “If there was an armed guard inside the temple, they would have been able to stop [the shooter].” The wounded includes four armed police officers who arrived at the scene. In his statement, Trump did not consider any plans to consider gun control legislation that would drastically reduce the frequency of mass shootings — even proposals that are popular with the public — because “this dispute will always exist.” Earlier, Trump also said in a tweet, “Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought,” adding later to reporters that it was a “terrible, terrible thing.” He also said that the crime “appears” to be a hate crime. “We're learning a lot about it. It looks definitely like it's an anti-Semitic crime,” he said. He then expressed incredulity that hate crimes and mass shootings still occur, saying, “That is something you wouldn't believe could still be going on.” Trump also promised to address the shooting further at an event in Indianapolis, Illinois, later this evening. Reporter: ""Mr. President, do you think you need to revisit gun laws?"" President Donald Trump: ""This has little to do with it ... If they had protection inside, the results would've been far better"" https://t.co/wHoucPm9ly pic.twitter.com/R5F8fgIDrU — CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 27, 2018 Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf parted ways with the president’s apparent reluctance to consider strengthening gun laws in the wake of the latest mass shooting. “We must all pray and hope for no more loss of life,” he said, reported the Associated Press. “But we have been saying ‘this one is too many’ for far too long. Dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm’s way.” Story continues Parkland shooting survivor and activist David Hogg also expressed his regret at inertia regarding gun control legislation, but also his willingness to continue the “fight.” In a tweet, he wrote: “It hurts every time I see these headlines and then the political inaction... but we have the power to change it. Squirrel Hill my heart is with you. We will fight for you every single day.” Trump has previously declined to push for any gun legislation and has floated the idea of arming teachers in schools as a means of defecse. After the Las Vegas mass shooting in 2017, which killed 58 people and injured over 600 more, Trump endorsed legislation banning the sale of bump stocks [an attachment that enables a semiautomatic rifle to fire faster], and stated that such action is “coming soon.” Like what you see?

The gun-rights organization said it may soon have to stop producing its magazines and its video streaming service, NRAtv, because of actions by the state of New York, which the NRA accused of running a ""blacklisting campaign."" The campaign appears to be part of a national campaign calling for companies to cut ties with the group in the aftermath of several high profile shootings, most notably with the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The gun lobbying group claims in its lawsuit, which targets Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Department of Financial Services and Maria Vullo, which heads the department, that the state has caused ""irrecoverable loss and irreparable harm"" to the organization. But, of course, the organization is making these claims in a lawsuit, which it hopes to win. The Rolling Stone first obtained the lawsuit and published the 45-page complaint online Friday. Over several months, the NRA has taken aim at the state of New York and its financial regulators after the state ruled the NRA's insurance, ""Carry Guard,"" was illegal because it gave liability protection to gun owners for acts where there was ""intentional wrongdoing."" The NRA claims in its lawsuit that it has lost its insurance coverage, something it claims its carrier wouldn't renew for ""any price.""

""Defendants seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional rights advocates. If their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed."" For years, the NRA has boasted about its large membership, which it claims to be about 5 million, though actual figures have never been released. The organization in its yearly tax filings shows it rakes in an average total of about $128 million. The Washington Post notes that number has varied over the years from a $72 million in 2006 to $228 million the following year. The newspaper notes the number of members appear to spike after a mass shooting. If true, one would think the back-to-back shootings in Florida, Texas, Nevada and Tennessee would have helped bolster the organization's finances. More:Feds: Russian operative tried to infiltrate National Rifle Association, other groups More:NRA draws fire from backers, foes for gun ban at event with Vice President Pence The organization is one of the largest lobbying groups. During the 2016 election cycle, the group spent $61 million to back current members of Congress, most of which benefitted Republicans. President Donald Trump received an additional $31 million in advertising during his campaign from the gun-rights group. But, Rolling Stone reported all that spending might have spelled some trouble for the group as the NRA overspent by $46 million in 2016. Students, who turned into gun-control advocates after the Parkland, Fla. shooting in February, applauded the news. The NRA has been their biggest target in the #NeverAgain movement, which reached a climax with the massive March for Our Lives rally in Washington. David Hogg, one of the leaders of the student-led movement, said the news is evidence ""the young people are winning."" Others offered the NRA ""thoughts and prayers,"" a common offering by politicians that's been criticized after mass shootings. Some said they didn't believe the NRA's claims and think the group is merely attempting to bolster its membership count and increase donations. Comedian Chelsea Handler posted on Twitter: ""Thoughts and prayers to the NRA who is saying they’re in a deep financial crisis and may be unable to exist.""

County sweep,"Law enforcement officials have seized 111 firearms and more than 27,000 rounds of ammunition from Californians under a new effort to confiscate weapons from people who have been barred from owning them, authorities announced Tuesday. Operation Dual Force, a partnership between the California Department of Justice and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, has so far closed 227 cases in the Armed and Prohibited Persons System — a list that identifies those who legally purchased guns but were later convicted of a felony or otherwise disqualified from holding firearms. Launched in June, the operation has resulted in 35 arrests. It is expected to end this December. Among the cache of weapons authorities confiscated were 56 handguns, 21 shotguns and 24 rifles, as well as 50 high-capacity magazines, California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra told reporters Tuesday morning. “Why California is the only state that does this, I don’t get it,” Becerra said as L.A. County Sheriff Jim McDonnell stood by his side. “For the buck, you get real value.” Advertisement In 2006, California became the first state in the nation to create a database that cross-references firearms purchasers against a list of people convicted of crimes, or who are subject to mental health judgments or domestic violence restraining orders that prohibit them from possessing guns. The list of prohibited people grew in its early years — faster than the understaffed state Department of Justice could seize guns in door-to-door searches, officials said. In January, about 10,226 people were still on the list of Californians who legally purchased guns but were later disqualified from possessing them. A surge in gun sales and a reduction in funding for the program had stymied efforts by the state Department of Justice to eliminate the backlog. “The number of people who are added to the APPS database continues to grow, somewhere between 60 to 100 I’m told per day,” Becerra said. “Keeping up is difficult. We’ve approached the legislature to try to help us tackle this.” Advertisement A change in state law that took effect Jan. 1 is expected to help the state put a big dent in the backlog. A provision of Proposition 63, passed in 2016, requires people convicted of certain crimes to provide proof that they sold or transferred their firearms before the court finalizes their sentence. Failure to comply could affect the case and result in the court sending officers to recover the firearms. Becerra said the number of people in the system has dropped to fewer than 10,000, which he called a “historic low.” “In L.A. County, we are down to approximately 1,600 active prohibited subjects,” said Samuel Richardson, who supervises a team of Department of Justice agents who seize guns in L.A. County. Advertisement That puts the county figures lower than they were three years ago, when the number sat at roughly 4,000, Richardson said. “We are making progress, it’s just extremely slow,” he said. During the press conference, the sheriff detailed the types of cases agents encountered in the field, including one person who was mentally ill and would not surrender his weapons. “Investigators were approached by several neighbors in the area and they all expressed their concern about the subject being unstable and they all feared for their safety,” McDonnell said. Advertisement The neighbors, he said, told authorities that the man regularly abused methamphetamine and that he would challenge people and threaten to shoot them during “drug-induced tirades.” In that case, a team recovered 10 guns and several thousand rounds of ammunition, McDonnell said. In another case, authorities found a man on parole who had a military-style rifle and several hundred rounds of ammunition. The team also found “white supremacist propaganda” at the man’s home. A few days later, McDonnell said, investigators discovered an additional two handguns and more ammunition. The cases will be referred to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office for prosecution.

Bernie Sanders on Sunday blasted Congress after a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, killed 10 students and teachers two days earlier. The Vermont senator blamed lawmakers for failing to act on gun control, saying they are intimidated by the National Rifle Association. When asked on “Meet The Press” if the Senate had done enough to prevent school shootings, Sanders said: “Of course not.” “But it’s like every other issue,” Sanders said, “the American people are united overwhelmingly — gun owners, non-gun owners — on common sense gun safety legislation.

It’s unspeakable.” Sanders put the blame on the NRA for why legislation has never passed, saying, “the NRA, frankly, which once was believe it or not a gun safety organization, teaching kids how to use guns safely, has moved to become part of, to become, a right-wing political organization far beyond guns, as a matter of fact.” Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, has a mixed record on guns, though he has taken a much more firm stance in recent years. Over the course of the 2016 presidential campaign, Democratic rival Hillary Clinton attacked him for being too moderate on the issue throughout his career. He voted multiple times against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in the early 1990s, which aimed to build a background check system and install waiting periods. But Sanders voted multiple times after the deadly mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, to expand background checks for all gun sales and has called for numerous changes to gun laws since then. Some local officials in Texas on Sunday also called for government leaders to take more action in trying to prevent mass shootings like the one that hit their community this week. “People at the state level and the federal level in too many places in our country are not doing anything other than offering prayers,” said Houston police chief Art Acevedo on CBS News.

(Photo: Johanne Rahaman for HuffPost) FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. ― Something powerful is happening in Florida. For the third straight day following a school shooting that left 17 dead and more than a dozen injured, community members gathered to demand gun control. And for those politicians who are in the pocket of the National Rifle Association, the people had another message: Be scared. On Saturday, more than a thousand Floridians swarmed around the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale to make their voices heard, refusing to let the shooting in Parkland fade into memory. Speakers included students, teachers and activists. The rally was sponsored by Moms Demand Action, the Broward Teachers Union, the League of Women Voters and other groups. Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, used to worry about tests. Now she worries about being shot. “My main concerns are funerals, gun control and whether or not I’m going to be shot wherever I go,” Tarr said. “My innocence ― our innocence ― has been taken from us. I’m 17, but in a matter of days have aged decades.” The gunman “slaughtered 17 of my people,” Tarr said. She’s asking for gun control so it doesn’t happen again. “Because of these gun laws, people I love have died,” she said. “Where’s the common sense in that? People are dying every day.” Another Stoneman Douglas High student, Emma Gonzalez, delivered a passionate and heartbreaking message to President Donald Trump. “If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should have never have happened, and maintains telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,” Gonzalez said. After the shooting, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) stuck with offering “thoughts and prayers.” They both have “A+” ratings from the NRA, and have been endorsed by the gun lobby during their campaign runs. Story continues “Vote them out! Vote them out!” Saturday’s crowd chanted at one point in reference to Scott and Rubio. To those politicians who have received money from the @NRA. pic.twitter.com/GhwptHSupU — Sebastian Murdock (@SebastianMurdoc) February 17, 2018 Among the officials speaking to the crowd, Coral Springs Commissioner Dan Daley, a graduate of Stoneman Douglas, said Florida has become the “gunshine state.” “Lives were cut short by one person who had no business to own an assault rifle,” Daley said. The gunman obtained an AR-15 and “used it for death and destruction.” “That’s not OK,” the commissioner said. “That’s insane.” Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said the way to take down gun-loving politicians is simple: vote. “We’ve got to vote,” Runcie told the crowd, to cheers. “We’ve got to vote. We’ve got to vote. If there’s no vote, this is just going to be a bunch of noise.” People gathered at the Fort Lauderdale federal courthouse on Feb. 17, 2018, to call for gun control in the wake of the deadly high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

The 46-year-old faces the death penalty after allegedly unleashing his guns on worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue, killing 11 in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. His online postings on Gab, a social network that bills itself as a champion of free speech, paint a picture of a white supremacist obsessed with far-right conspiracy theories about Jews, singling out a Jewish non-profit that provides aid to refugees as a target in a chilling message posted hours before his attack. ""HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in,"" he wrote. HIAS is the acronym for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. His account has since been suspended but screenshots have been widely circulated by SITE, a US-based extremism monitor, as well as by other media outlets. Other posts on the network referred to the caravan of Central American migrants making its way to the US as ""invaders,"" while he also accused Jews of being responsible for Muslim migration into the United States, writing: ""Open you Eyes! It's the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!!"" But while both migrants and Muslims have been frequent targets of Donald Trump, Bowers was no fan of the US president, whom he derisively dismissed as a ""globalist"" and not a ""nationalist."" Using a slur for Jews, he said, ""There is no #MAGA, as long as there is a k--- infestation."" MAGA refers to Trump's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again. In another post before the shooting, he said he had not voted for Trump. Bowers has been charged with 29 federal crimes and has made statements in custody ""evincing an animus towards people of the Jewish faith,"" according to a criminal complaint filed Saturday night. Story continues ""They're committing genocide to my people. I just want to kill Jews,"" he told a law enforcement officer, the complaint added. - Gun obsessed - Bowers lived in a low-income apartment complex in the Baldwin Borough suburb of Pittsburgh, less than half an hour's drive south of the Tree of Life synagogue. The building was raided by authorities Saturday night, forcing other residents to evacuate amid fears Bower's unit may be rigged with explosives. Chris Hall, a 28-year-old neighbor told AFP he felt ""awful,"" adding: ""I didn't know that type of caliber of person could be living right next door without any clue of what any motive he would have, and who could do something like this."" According to former neighbors from when Bowers lived at a previous address, he had worked as a trucker, kept to himself, and would sometimes stay at home for days at a stretch. Linda Lohr, a retired paralegal, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette she was shocked, saying that although he was quiet, he was also the kind of neighbor who would call to let her know if she left the garage door open. Bowers has no known criminal record, according to the paper, but had on occasion had ""contacts"" with local police over non-criminal issues. He was given a traffic citation in 2015 for operating a vehicle without registration plates, and was subject to a debt claim by Colonial Credit Corporation for $2,065 in 2005. Licensed to carry firearms, he had bought at least six guns since 1996, according to an official CNN spoke with. He also professed his love for his ""family"" of Glock pistols in a post on Gab, where he outlined their technical characteristics. Three Glocks were recovered from Bowers after his attack, as well as an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle favored in other recent mass shootings in the US. Bowers remained hospitalized Sunday, after suffering multiple injuries during a shootout with police. Officials said he had been operated on, and was in a stable condition. ""I'm in shock. I can't believe that happened,"" said Terry Choate, a retired government contractor who told the Post-Gazette he knew Bowers for nearly the suspect's entire life. ""I can't believe he did that. I'd like to know what set him off.""",Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Tree of Life Congregation Suspect Shooting Criminal charge Antisemitism Synagogue Hate crime Crime Jewish people,A screenshot of Robert Bowers’s Facebook page.,"Pittsburgh (AFP) - In the months leading up to Saturday's massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Robert Bowers used a little-known social network to spew hatred toward Jews, calling them the ""Children of Satan"" as he showed off his ""family"" of firearms.

The charges against Robert Bowers, the suspect in what is believed to be the deadliest attack on Jews in the United States, include religious hate crimes, firearms charges and causing injury to police officers. Bowers is due to appear in a second hearing in federal court in Pittsburgh on Thursday. Donald Trump has called for capital punishment to be brought ""back into vogue,"" asking for Mr Bowers to receive the death penalty. Several of the counts carry the possibility of a death sentence, which prosecutors said that they will seek, Reuters reports. An account in Mr Bowers' name on the website ""Gab"" had included antisemetic sentiments. According to an FBI affidavit, Mr Bowers told a SWAT officer that he wanted ""all Jews to die."" Authorities believe the alleged shooter acted alone. A grand jury has now indicted Bowers on all counts. The counts include 11 charges of obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death, as well as 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder. There are also two counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon and resulting in bodily injury; 11 counts of use and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, eight counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon, and resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer; and one count of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving use of a dangerous weapon and resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer. If found guilty of all counts, the suspect faces a chance of the death penalty, or a life sentence without parole followed by 535 years in prison. After the shooting, Mr Trump visited the Tree of Life synagogue where the massacre took place. Protests from the Jewish community erupted, and the mayor of Pittsburgh asked the president not to come. Critics argue that Trump is partially responsible for a divisive culture that inspires hate crimes from the American right. For example, he recently referred to himself as a ""nationalist,"" a term that some say is tied to discrimination. However, he has also denounced the shootings and said that the does not support violence in America. Thousands of supporters came to funerals for the victims on Wednesday and Thursday. Story continues The last post on the Gab account with Mr Bowers' name read: “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.” When police arrived on the scene, officers shot Bowers, who later surrendered. Emergency Medical Services treated victims and Bowers.

Steyer’s NextGen America group is working with Giffords — the group founded by former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, after she was shot in 2011 — and Everytown for Gun Safety, founded by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The effort is kicking off with a $1 million donation from Steyer. Advertisement “In the wake of this shooting in Parkland, what we saw was [that] the difference between this shooting and other shootings is these were older kids, and they had a voice that was incredibly powerful on a topic where elected officials had been paid for years — or decades — to look the other way,” Steyer told POLITICO, referring to surviving students who have spoken out in favor of stricter gun laws. The push will expand the footprint of NextGen America beyond the college campuses where it maintains a significant presence across the country.

The effort, which will include a national voter registration drive, will focus on states and districts represented by incumbent Republican lawmakers who have taken money from the National Rifle Association and voted against gun control measures. The campaign is set to launch on March 25, the day after planned protests for gun safety spurred by the Parkland shooting. “If this Congress won’t act to protect our kids, we must elect one that will,” Giffords said in a statement that the coalition was set to release on Thursday evening. “If the politicians who have benefited from millions of dollars in NRA cash won’t pass laws to make our schools and communities safer, we will vote them out. Today, students from Parkland and across the country are inspiring the country to be better. Come November, many of those young Americans will be making the difference themselves as they cast their votes for the first time.” The effort, which will include digital and mail registration pushes, will also work to pre-register students who are not yet 18 in states where that is allowed. The pledged money is on top of the $30 million Steyer has already committed to trying to flip the House of Representatives from GOP control. He announced that effort in January while revealing that he would not run for office back home in California. Steyer is by far Democrats’ largest donor in recent election cycles, to the tune of nearly $200 million. But his profile has risen in recent months around his push to impeach President Donald Trump. That campaign has cost Steyer at least $20 million, including an investment in straight-to-camera nationwide television ads — spots that sparked speculation that Steyer himself may consider running for president in 2020.",Tom Steyer Democratic Party Politics Efforts to impeach Donald Trump Voting Billionaire Election Impeachment Political campaign Candidate,"Tom Steyer, the hedge fund manager and environmentalist, is leading a push to register high school students to vote around gun issues.","“We’ve always said the millennials are the biggest and least politically represented group in the U.S. This is exactly why we’re doing what we’re doing,” said Tom Steyer, the Democratic billionaire activist. | Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo Tom Steyer, gun safety groups plan voter registration drive for high school students In response to last week’s deadly shooting in Florida, two prominent gun safety groups are joining with Tom Steyer, the Democratic billionaire activist, in a push ahead of the midterm elections to register high school students to vote around gun issues.","cities across the country. politico playbook newsletter sign up to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics email sign up by signing up. brands like tom steyer, gun safety groups are joining with tom steyer, the democratic billionaire activist, in a push ahead of the midterm elections to register high school students to vote around gun issues",1,2,7,3,16,0,0,0.0,0,10

Jones was a grandmother and retired hospital office administrator who lived down the road from the supermarket. Authorities allege that just before 3 p.m on Wednesday, Bush entered a Kroger supermarket and shot and killed his first victim, Maurice Stallard, 69. CNN reported that Stallard was at the store buying poster board with his 12-year-old grandson for a school project. “The murders are not being taken lightly by the United States government,” said US Attorney Russell M. Coleman for the Western District of Kentucky in a statement. Police arrested Gregory Bush, 51, and charged him with two counts of murder for the shooting in the Louisville suburb of Jeffersontown. After the killings, Bush reportedly told a man, “whites don’t shoot whites.” A white man charged with shooting and killing two black people at a Kroger supermarket in Kentucky on Wednesday is being investigated by federal authorities as a possible hate crime. Jones and Stallard are both black. The Western District of Kentucky US Attorney’s Office said it is investigating the shootings as possible federal hate crimes. Prior to the shooting, security footage showed Bush had tried to gain access to the nearby First Baptist Church, a predominately black church, according to Jeffersontown Police Chief Sam Rogers. A church attendee who was in the parking lot told local news station WDRB they saw Bush banging and pulling on the church doors trying to get in. “Loss of life anywhere is pretty tragic, but just to think that an hour and a half earlier we had 70 people in the church,” said church administrator Billy Williams, according to WDRB. “But by the time he came through, all doors were locked, and there were probably 8 or 10 still in the building.” A Louisville resident, Ed Harrell, was at the supermarket with his wife during the shooting. After hearing the shots, he crouched, holding a revolver, behind his car, he told the Courier-Journal. He saw Bush walk out carrying a gun and yelled out to him to ask what was going on. “Don’t shoot me. I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites,” said Bush, according to Harrell, who is white. Bush then fled in a car and was arrested shortly afterward. Court documents seen by WDRB reveal various incidents of domestic violence dating back to 2001 and that Bush was hospitalized twice because of mental health problems. Bush’s parents took out an emergency protective order against their adult son in 2009, after he punched his father in the jaw, grabbed his mother by the neck and shot a telephone to stop them from calling authorities. Another time, his father said that Bush made a racist threat, saying, “Tonight might be black death.” “Federal investigators are supporting local law enforcement and examining this matter from the perspective of federal criminal law, which includes potential civil rights violations such as hate crimes,” said Coleman on Friday.",Maurice Stallard Jeffersontown Kroger shooting  Kroger Shooting Kentucky Hate crime Black people African Americans Pittsburgh synagogue shooting,A police officer at the scene of the shooting.,"The Jeffersontown Police Department said Bush then exited the store, where he shot and killed his second victim, Vickie Jones, 67, in the parking lot.

The NRA said it may no longer be able to produce its magazines, run its video streaming service or hold rallies because the state of New York has caused """" irrecoverable loss and irreparable harm"""" to the organization. According to the suit, obtained by Rolling Stone , the NRA lost its insurance coverage after actions taken by the New York financial regulators to halt an NRA-branded insurance program called Carry Guard, a policy to reimburse NRA members for costs after firing a legal gun. In May, New York ruled that the policy 'unlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for certain acts of intentional wrongdoing' and fined the NRA $7 million. The NRA -- which is not noted for its measured rhetoric -- also said New York has launched a 'discrimination campaign' against it by encouraging insurance agencies, insurers, and banks to terminate business relationships that 'were necessary to the survival of the NRA as a charitable organization.' In the wake of the Parkland school shooting in Florida which left 17 people dead, Cuomo described the NRA as an 'extremist organization' while encouraging companies in New York with ties to the group to 'consider their reputations, and responsibility to the public.' The state Department of Financial Services and its superintendent, Maria Vullo, have also been named as defendants in NRA’s suit along with the Democratic governor. 'Directed by Governor Andrew Cuomo, this campaign involves selective prosecution, backroom exhortations, and public threats with a singular goal—to deprive the NRA and its constituents of their First Amendment rights to speak freely about gun-related issues and defend the Second Amendment,' the suit states. 'If the NRA is unable to collect donations from its members, safeguard the assets endowed to it, apply its funds to cover media buys and other expenses integral to its political speech, and obtain basic corporate insurance coverage, it will be unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission. 'Defendants seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional rights advocates. If their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed.' Responding to the suit, Cuomo said the motion to dismiss argues that the actions were not an attempt at 'blacklisting' and were designed to protect New Yorkers. """"If I could have put the NRA out of business, I would have done it 20 years ago,' Cuomo added in a statement.""",Ohio National Rifle Association Physician Florida Stand-your-ground law Health Gun Health Care,A display of the gun-rights group’s gun control group at the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting in June.,"""The NRA said it may no longer be able to produce its magazines, run its video streaming service or hold rallies because the state of New York has caused """"irrecoverable loss and irreparable harm"""" to the organization.

Everytown, which is largely funded by Michael Bloomberg, has endorsed 196 candidates this year in 36 states, and more than 40 volunteers for Moms Demand Action are running for office. [On the road with the Parkland activists.] One of them is Amber Gustafson, who was the group’s Iowa leader in the run-up to the 2016 election. A gun owner and former Republican, Ms. Gustafson is now challenging the majority leader of the Iowa Senate as a Democrat. (She went from Republican to independent in 2008 and registered as a Democrat in 2016, driven mainly by her views on health care and guns.) She said she discussed gun policy with every voter she visited. “I say, ‘I’m a gun owner’ — and I always put my hand over my heart — ‘and I care about the Second Amendment, but I also want to make sure that guns do not fall into the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,’” she said. She supports universal background checks and red-flag laws, which would allow the temporary removal of guns if a person’s relatives or law enforcement attest that they pose an immediate threat. She emphasizes that her opponent, State Senator Jack Whitver, supported a bill that would have dismantled Iowa’s permitting system for gun purchases.

Andrew Cuomo is pushing governors in other states to target the National Rifle Association, which says it has suffered “tens of millions of dollars in damages” because of financial sanctions imposed in New York. The gun-rights group sued Cuomo and his financial services superintendent in May, saying fines by the state Department of Financial Services were exacting a “political vendetta” by the Democratic governor that was having a chilling effect on its advocacy. Advertisement On Monday, Cuomo urged leaders in other states to take similar actions against the NRA’s Carry Guard insurance program, which covers legal costs stemming from self-defense shootings, something New York argues is unlawful. The Department of Financial Services has also pushed firms not to do business with the NRA, the NRA contends, under threat the firms could lose their license to operate in New York. The effect of these moves and Cuomo’s public statements has been to “coerce insurance agencies, insurers and banks into terminating business relationships with the NRA that were necessary to the survival of the NRA as a charitable organization,” the NRA said in an amended complaint filed July 20. Great, Cuomo replied pithily. “If I could have put the NRA out of business, I would have done it 20 years ago,” the governor said late Friday after Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a motion to dismiss the NRA’s suit. He added on Saturday: “I'm tired of hearing the politicians say, we'll remember them in our thoughts and prayers. If the NRA goes away, I'll remember the NRA in my thoughts and prayers."" Cuomo wrote to other governors on Monday, urging them to “examine your laws and determine whether or not this product is being illegally sold in your state, and I encourage you to follow New York's lead and block the sale of these NRA products if they are illegal, or to outlaw these products if they are not already prohibited.” He took his message to national media outlets, including CNN, MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” and National Public Radio’s “All Things Considered” on Sunday. Cuomo, who is seeking a third term in November and faces a Democratic primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, also released a campaign advertisement. Gun control is popular in New York, especially among Democrats, polls show. In 2013, about a month after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, Cuomo pushed through a multi-pronged gun-control bill called the SAFE Act, NY S2230 (13R). Cuomo, who is positioning himself for a possible 2020 presidential run, has seized on the issue in the wake of subsequent mass shootings, including at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. A July analysis by Quorum found that Cuomo made more public statements about guns than any other governor in 2018. The NRA deferred comment to William Brewer, its lawyer in the suit against Cuomo. Brewer said the NRA stands by its Carry Guard program. “It appears the Governor has launched yet another crusade against the NRA to fuel his political ambitions,” Brewer said in a statement. “The governor’s current campaign against the NRA extends far beyond Carry Guard. His scorched earth tactics are designed to prohibit the NRA from having access to insurance and banking services — simply because he disagrees with the political viewpoint of this law-abiding organization. Suffice it to say, the NRA will continue to vigorously defend itself, advocate for the Second Amendment, and fight to protect the Constitutional freedoms of all Americans.” It’s unclear how much Carry Guard, which was launched in April 2017, contributes to the NRA’s coffers. According to the NRA’s most recently available tax returns, it took in $366.9 million and spent $412.7 million in 2016.

The US attorney based in Pittsburgh has begun the process of seeking the death penalty for Robert Bowers, who made his first appearance in court Monday. The attorney general must ultimately give the OK to pursue the death penalty for the alleged gunman, the Justice Department said. On Monday, Sessions labeled the assault a ""murderous rampage."" ""He'll be subjected to the death penalty perhaps,"" the attorney general said in an address in Boston. ""This was not just an attack on the Jewish faith,"" he said. ""It was attack on all people of faith, and it was an attack on America's values of protecting those of faith. It cannot, it will not, be tolerated."" Suspect appears in court Bowers is accused of killing 11 people and injuring at least six more at Tree of Life synagogue -- the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in US history, according to the Anti-Defamation League. He faces charges in state and federal court. In Monday's brief federal court hearing, Bowers spoke only to answer questions from the judge. He wore a blue shirt and handcuffs, which US marshals removed so he could sign paperwork. Two public defenders appeared with Bowers in court Monday, but counsel who will handle his case going forward has yet to be appointed. He is being held without bond, and is expected back in court for a preliminary hearing Thursday morning. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said he believed the case calls for the federal death penalty. Shapiro said his office is looking into whether Bowers and others used the social media platform Gab to incite violence, based on evidence that Bowers frequently posted anti-Semitic comments on the site. ""There's a difference between heinous bigotry, and a platform being used to incite violence in our community,"" Shapiro told CNN. ""I'm not saying for certain that is what's occurring. I'm saying that's something that we're interested in looking at."" Bowers used anti-Semitic slurs, complained that President Donald Trump was surrounded by too many Jewish people,and blamed Jews for helping migrant caravans in Central America. Minutes before allegedly storming inside the building, he logged onto Gab again and wrote to his followers. ""I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered,"" he wrote. ""Screw your optics, I'm going in."" Gab denied supporting violence and said its mission is ""to defend free expression and individual liberty online."" The company said it has been taken down by hosting providers, app stores and payment processors since the shooting. It blamed a smear campaign by the mainstream media, and said it will be up again once it transitions to a new hosting provider. A community in shock The shooting struck the heart of historically Jewish Squirrel Hill and spurred sadness as the victims' identities were revealed. President Donald Trump condemned the violence and ordered flags flown at half-staff in honor of the victims. ""It's hard to understand how significant these losses are to our community unless you understand the significance and intimacy of Squirrel Hill,"" said Tree of Life congregant Jesse Rabner. ""The community is knit so tight that one life affects thousands. It's a norm to be Jewish in Squirrel Hill, and it's a loving and peaceful community."" Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood following the shoooting. All corners of the Pittsburgh region mourned, including the city's sports teams and athletes. The Pittsburgh Steelers observed a moment of silence on Sunday before their game against the Cleveland Browns. On Monday, Pittsburgh public schools held a moment of silence as students headed back to class and offered counseling services to students and employees.

MUST WATCH Steelers logo altered to honor shooting victims 01:14 Mayor expresses concern over President's visit The massacre capped a week of traumatic events with common roots in hate. The massacre stoked debate over a possible connection between President Trump's criticism of his detractors, including Democrats, the media and prominent members of the American Jewish community, and the recent acts of domestic violence. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders rejected any such ties and suggested the media could improve the tone of discourse by highlighting the President's positive actions. President Trump was scheduled to visit Pittsburgh this week as funerals begin. But the city's Democratic mayor expressed concern that the visit might detract from the funerals. ""We did try to get the message out to the White House that our priority tomorrow is the first funeral,"" Mayor Bill Peduto told Anderson Cooper. ""I do believe that it would be best to put the attention on the families this week and, if he were to visit, choose a different time to be able to do it. Our focus as a city will be on the families and the outreach they will need this week and the support they'll need to get through it."" The state's Democratic attorney general said he hopes the President brings ""words of healing"" to Pennsylania"" and ""speaks with moral clarity."" ""The President has a unique responsibility to rise above the noise and bring down the temperature of our rhetoric, and help our community begin to heal. That's what I want to see from our President,"" he said. ""Sadly he seems to miss the mark every time he opens up his mouth or engages his Twitter feed."" A survivor recounts the shooting Rabbi Hazzan Jeffrey Myers with Tree of Life said this week's focus will be on celebrating the lives of the victims, starting with funerals on Tuesday for brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal. ""It's not a day to show anger, it's not a day to show bitterness, it's a day to celebrate the lives of two wonderful, decent human beings,"" he told CNN.

""I turned back to see if I could help the remaining people in the back of my congregation. At that time I could hear the gunfire getting louder. It was no longer safe to be there. I had to leave them."" He pledged to rebuild the synagogue so it returns ""stronger and better than ever."" Officers leave hospital The suspect was taken into custody after a shootout with police and treated in a hospital. He was released Monday morning. Four law enforcement officers were injured in the shootout; two had been released from the hospital as of Monday. Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert said SWAT officers forced the suspect to surrender while saving the life of a wounded team member. ""As they were doing this, they were also taking care of the officers that were injured. Credit to the team -- they were able to apply a tourniquet to one of the officers, in my opinion and in the opinion of others, saving his life,"" he said. ""What's really special to us are the amount of letters and cards we're getting from the community, especially from children who are just thanking our officers for what they do,"" he said. ""That means a lot with what we're going through now to see that and to see that the community is concerned about us just as much as we're concerned about them."" Investigators are in touch with police in Dormont, a borough in Allegheny County, about prior incidents involving Bowers, a person familiar with the investigation said. Dormont Police Chief Michael Bisignani said there were mostly minor incidents from 1993 to 2004, including a traffic citation.

The guns rights organization made the claim in documents filed in a New York federal court in late July, which were first reported by Rolling Stone. The NRA is suing the New York State Department of Financial Services and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after the state agency encouraged financial services companies in New York not to do business with the gun rights organization after the Florida shooting. The NRA argues in its lawsuit that it's been the victim of a ""discrimination campaign"" and that it has suffered harm to its reputation and marketing damages worth tens of millions of dollars. ""The NRA has suffered tens of millions of dollars in damages,"" the lawsuit read. ""Such damages include, without limitation, damages due to reputational harm, increased development and marketing costs for any potential new NRA-endorsed insurance programs, and lost royalty amounts owed to the NRA, as well as attorneys’ fees, legal expenses, and other costs."" The hardline group also claims that if it cannot use banking services and receive donations from members, then it ""will be unable to exist as a not-for-profit."" ""Simply put, defendants made it clear to banks and insurers that it is bad business in New York to do business with the NRA,"" said the organization in its complaint. Back in April, the state financial services agency issued a memo calling on insurers, banks, and other financial companies to ""review"" their relationships with the NRA and other gun promotional organizations. The memo names the Parkland shooting — where 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14 — as one of the reasons to be careful of public safety.

Two of them said he displayed a gun. A black man who drives a septic truck told Pinellas Sheriff's Detective George Moffett that he parked in the same handicapped-accessible spot three months before McGlockton's July 19 videotaped shooting, the court documents show. The man said Drejka, 48, began yelling at him and said he would shoot him. The driver said he left, but as he pulled away, Drejka shouted racial slurs. The man's boss told Detective Moffett that Drejka later called, telling him ""that he was lucky he didn't blow his employee's head off."" Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox In separate 2012 cases, drivers reported that Drejka waved a gun at them during road rage confrontations. In both cases, officers stopped Drejka and found a gun in his car, but he denied showing it to the other drivers. Michael Drejka Pinellas County Sheriff's Office On Tuesday, a Florida judge kept bond at $100,000 for Drejka, who was charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a 28-year-old McGlockton, a black man who shoved him outside a convenience store in a dispute over parking. Judge Joseph Bulone in the Pinellas County court said that if Drejka posts bail, he must surrender all of his guns to the sheriff, wear an ankle monitor and not leave the county. He said he didn't have the money to hire a private attorney, which means a public defender will be appointed. McGlockton's girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, was seated in the couple's car on July 19 with two of their children, ages 3 years and 4 months, when she said Drejka confronted her for being parked in a handicapped-accessible space. McGlockton had gone into the store with the couple's 5-year-old son, also named Markeis. ""I can tell my kids now that the police got the bad man,"" Jacobs said, following the brief bond hearing. She was one of several family members who attended. ""I'm still answering their questions about when daddy is going to wake up. And all I can tell them is, daddy is resting right now."" Video of the July incident showed McGlockton leaving the store and shoving Drejka to the ground. Seconds later, Drejka pulled a handgun and shot McGlockton as he backed away. McGlockton then ran back into the store clutching his chest. Witnesses said he collapsed in front of young Markeis, who was waiting inside. McGlockton later died at a nearby hospital. ""The charges are only one step in this journey to get justice for the unbelievable killing of Markeis McGlockton in front of his children,"" said Benjamin Crump, the family's attorney. ""They understand when you look at the history of the state of Florida and stand your ground that this doesn't equal a conviction. All of America is watching Clearwater, Florida to see if there will be equal justice for Markeis McGlockton ... If the facts were in reverse, nobody would doubt what the outcome would be."" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri originally declined to charge Drejka, saying one day after the shooting that the man was protected by Florida's stand-your-ground law. The sheriff passed the case to prosecutors for a final decision. The McGlockton family said Monday the manslaughter charge provides them ""with a small measure of comfort in our time of profound mourning.""

950,110274,http://www.yahoo.com/news/southern-california-city-mourns-wake-bar-massacre-070443860.html,Official: Shooter debated sanity online during bar massacre,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- The gunman who killed 12 people at a country music bar in Southern California went on social media during the attack and posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane, a law enforcement official said Friday. Also, one of the possibilities investigators are looking into is whether gunman Ian David Long believed his former girlfriend would be at the bar, the official said. Authorities have not determined a motive for Wednesday night's rampage at the Borderline Bar and Grill. The official was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The official would not give additional details on what the 28-year-old former Marine posted on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. A second law enforcement official said that when Long was inside the bar, he apparently stopped shooting and posted to Instagram, based on the time stamps of the posts. Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian also said he didn't know the content of the posts. Neither Facebook nor Instagram responded to a request for comment Friday. Long's social media accounts have been taken down. Long, a former machine gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire with a handgun during college night at the bar, then apparently killed himself as scores of police officers closed in. As investigators worked to figure out what set him off, President Donald Trump blamed mental illness, describing the gunman as ""a very sick puppy"" who had ""a lot of problems."" Investigators have not commented on whether mental illness played a role in the rampage. But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff's deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed. Story continues Several people who knew Long a decade ago as a high-schooler in the suburb of Thousand Oaks said in interviews that he made them uncomfortable, sometimes through aggressive behavior. At the White House, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on PTSD among veterans. He declined to engage on questions on whether the nation needs stricter gun control laws. The dead in the shooting rampage included sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran gunned down as he entered the bar, and Telemachus Orfanos, 27, who survived last year's massacre in Las Vegas, where a gunman in a high-rise hotel opened killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival. Authorities in Thousand Oaks described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire, authorities said. Instead, when Long shot, he killed. ""Every Marine is trained in urban warfare and indoor gun fighting,"" said Marc Bender, an instructor for emergency responders in Riverside County, California. ""Every Marine is a marksman."" Julie Hanson, who lives next door to the Longs' ranch-style home, described him as ""odd"" and ""disrespectful"" well before he left home a decade ago, got married and enlisted in the Marines. She could often hear him yelling and cursing, but several months ago, unusually loud banging and shouting prompted her husband to call authorities. ""I was concerned because I knew he had been in the military,"" Tom Hanson said. About 18 months ago, Don and Effie MacLeod heard ""an awful argument"" and what he believes was a gunshot from the Longs' property. Don MacLeod said he did not call police but avoided speaking with Ian Long. ""I told my wife, 'Just be polite to him. If he talks, just acknowledge him, don't go into conversation with him,' "" Don MacLeod said. Long made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens. Dominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative. In one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his. ""I literally feared for myself around him,"" Colell said in an interview. ""He was the only athlete that I was scared of."" Colell said she wanted to kick Long off the team but the boy's coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines. She relented when, at the next track meet, Long apologized in front of several coaches and administrators. Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at Newbury Park High School and its school district were unsuccessful. Both were closed because of a destructive wildfire in the area. ___ Balsamo reported from Washington.

The San Francisco bank issued a $40-million line of credit last week to gun manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Co., according to financial filings. That’s on top of the $431 million in debt that Wells Fargo has arranged for gun makers since December 2012, when the Sandy Hook school shooting escalated the gun control debate. No other bank lent more to the industry over that time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The new debt, issued to one of the world’s largest publicly traded gun makers, came as a big surprise to at least one group: nuns who had been talking to Wells Fargo about corporate-responsibility issues. On Sept. 26, the day before the debt agreement was issued, they met with the bank’s business-standards employees in New York. “This is shocking news because we are in sustained dialogue with Wells Fargo,” said Nora Nash, a sister at St. Francis of Philadelphia who was at the meeting as a member of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. “This new business relationship with Sturm Ruger is in direct conflict with ethics, culture and respect for human rights throughout the company.” Advertisement Unlike Wells Fargo, a number of big banks, including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., said they would reduce ties to gun makers after the February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead. Wells Fargo also has a long relationship with the NRA, offering credit and operating its primary bank accounts. Wells Fargo said it continues to work with the Interfaith Center on business standards. “Wells Fargo wants schools and communities to be safe from gun violence, but changes to laws and regulations should be determined through a legislative process that gives the American public an opportunity to participate and not be arbitrarily set by a bank,” the bank said in a statement. Bank of America had extended credit to Ruger until June, when the line expired. After the Parkland shooting, it had specifically said it would stop lending to companies that make assault-style rifles — which the company does. Advertisement The Charlotte, N.C., bank said it doesn’t comment on client matters. A representative for Ruger did not respond to requests for comment. The religious community has been playing a shareholder-activist role on the gun issue. This year, groups introduced shareholder proposals at Ruger and American Outdoor Brands Corp., formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding Corp., that require the companies to produce reports on gun safety. Both proposals passed. The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility is involved in the business-standards review with Wells Fargo. The bank said in its 2018 proxy statement it has agreed to conduct the review and publish the results on its website by year’s end. It’s unknown how Ruger will use the line of credit. During an earnings call in February, President Christopher J. Killoy said the company was closely watching Remington Outdoor Co., a firearms and ammunition juggernaut that went through bankruptcy protection this year. Advertisement The line of credit “gives them the flexibility to use the line or not use it, so is perfect for having the ability to make future acquisitions,” said Rommel Dionisio, a gun-industry analyst with Aegis Capital Corp. Laura Krausa, an investor in Ruger through the nonprofit Catholic Health Initiatives, said the company should use the debt to pay for research into smart guns. “In being optimistic,” she said, “we would really hope that a line of credit this large would be put to good use in really answering that call to have the gun manufacturers be a part of the solution to the increasing problem of gun violence in America.”",Wells Fargo  Bank Loan Mortgage loan Insurance  Finance Financial services Car finance,A Wells Fargo branch in New York.

It's the latest mass action since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that claimed seventeen lives and galvanized young people to act in the long-stalled debate over guns. Some activists are heartened by the attention being paid to the issue but they raise questions about how these students get viewed versus the treatment of their peers in the Black Lives Matter movement. I spoke to one of those activists, Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement. Cullors, a New York Times best selling author, also spoke about gender dynamics as it relates to violence and her connection with another activist, Richard Edmond Vargas, whose work in a California prison is the subject of a CNN documentary called The Feminist on Cellblock Y , now streaming on CNNgo. Our conversation, edited slightly for flow and length, is below: Emma Lacey-Bordeaux: What's missing from this current conversation we're having about the gun violence? Patrisse Cullors: It's been really incredible to witness. The interventions, the narrative interventions that have been made over the last couple of weeks. And the relationship to, which people get to become victims and which people get to become heroes. We've seen black folks be on the front line, fighting for better gun laws and yes, our issues have not been amplified, even though we have been disproportionately impacted by gun violence. While I'm so, so glad the Parkland students had the support that they deserve, we can't deny, uh, that the conversation on gun violence isn't incredibly racialized. Lacey-Bordeaux: How does that make you feel? Cullors: It's frustrating, and it's enraging, and it's clarifying, because it's important as organizers that we're able to articulate why racism permeates every single fight that we're in, especially when we're trying to fight for our lives. Lacey-Bordeaux: Then, given this renewed focus on gun violence, do you expect or hope that there could be a different level of interest or approach to hearing the voices of young people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement? Cullors: I think so. I've been pretty impressed with the Parkland students who've listened to young black students and brown students, mostly poor students who've been saying, you know, ""our issues matter, too."" And many of the Parkland students who've gone to Chicago and then met up with the black youth, to talk about gun violence. Um, one of the young men, was quoted saying, our issues, as in white people's issues, are being amplified over black people's issues, it's just a matter of race, and I thought that was so powerful, because they're listening to the young black and brown students who are saying, you know, we deserve to be a part of this larger media conversation, part of this larger public dialog and outcry to save the lives of young black and brown people too. So that has been so impressive. And I point that out because it's important for us to name our victories and I think that narrative shift has happened because black people have said, ""hey, wait a second, like, let's be a little bit more complicated about how we're talking about this gun violence issue,"" and the Parkland students have heard it and have been amplifying. Lacey-Bordeaux: We, Contessa Gayles and I, read your book with great interest and it was cool to read about Richard Edmond Vargas, the main character in our documentary, in your book -- in that chapter, specifically, you describe how the Black Lives Matter movement was founded, by the acquittal of George Zimmerman. So I wanted to ask you about that framing. Why frame both Richard's story and your part in co-founding the movement in relationship to each other? What's that connection? Cullors: Richie is very important because he becomes one of the first young people that I mentor when I'm a young person. I was 21 when I met him, he was 14 years old. And he quickly becomes like a little brother to me. And when he's convicted it was devastating for all of us. I made a commitment to stay in his life, and staying a part of his life. George Zimmerman killed somebody, literally, I mean, Richie didn't hurt anybody, maybe scared a few people but he didn't physically harm anybody, and I am visiting him, in a jail cell, in a locked-up facility, far away from his family and his loved ones. And, then George Zimmerman killed a young person, a young black boy, gets to go home free, and it just shows this juxtaposition of the banality of a quote ""criminal justice system,"" that has not been run to prioritize black people's health and wellness, and it's sort of amplified in that moment. Lacey-Bordeaux: How involved have you been with any of his anti-patriarchy efforts? Cullors: Oh, it's been amazing. I mean, he knows all about patriarchy, doesn't he? (laughs) You know, I remember talking to him when he first got into county jail and he used to get in a lot of fights at the county jail. Not, not because he wanted to and I remember talking to him on the phone, he called me, and he's like, ""alright I'm about to get in a fight right now,"" and I said, ""OK, listen to me, you get to choose what kind of person you wanna be inside, you could still be an organizer, they didn't take that away from you, you get to organize on the inside,"" and he said, ""OK."" He ended up going to Susanville, 11 hours away, the guards were exceptionally violent, and he was just trying to survive in there. And we were talking about like what does it look like (to) organize inside. Richard's not someone who is quick to be quiet, because he's just like already having conversations about patriarchy and, you know, and, by the time it got so bad is when I think his greatest ideas took root. And, he set up this platform to amplify these conversations about patriarchy and its toxicity and its impact on men and boys, and I was just, it was brilliant, and he's brilliant, and, so impactful, and everything he touches turns to gold, you know, everything he explores and every conversation he has, he feels a sincerity, nothing is inauthentic about Richard Edmond. Lacey-Bordeaux: Somewhat in line with that, how do you see patriarchy as playing a role in Richard ending up in prison? Cullors: I think Richard has a lot of different choices to make and I think the peer pressure of patriarchy won. When he told me why he robbed, he was trying to pay rent and he, you know, he wasn't getting the hours he needed at the preschool. I asked him, ""why didn't you just ask me for money, like, you've lived- you've lived with me before, you've asked me for money, like why didn't you ask me for rent money?"" And he said ""I was ashamed. You know, I was told that like I need to be providing, that, you know, taking money from women ...,"" and so this idea of like who he had to be and what he had to do to get what he needed is chock-full of patriarchy. And that really shaped his decisions and his, you know, decision that was then landing him in prison for all these years. And, you know, I don't know, I think it's interesting, like, I'd love to ask him, like if he would change it, and if he would change what he did, um, I don't know what he would - you know I don't know what his life would be like, I'm not a person who's like ""go to prison and change!"" I'm actually not that person at all, but one thing he's been able to do on the inside for everybody else and for himself is remarkable. Granted we'll see what happens, you know, what life on the outside's gonna be like for him, he's incredibly resilient. He'll be fine, but, the impact of incarceration is a lifelong impact. Lacey-Bordeaux: What's the connection between patriarchy and violence? Cullors: We're seeing it now, like with mass shootings, exclusively by white men (Note: The vast majority of shootings are by men, but the interview was conducted before a shooting by a woman at YouTube headquarters), we're seeing it with the Boston Bomber, we see it with law enforcement, and the police that use violence as a form of control and power. Lacey-Bordeaux: What's the solution? Cullors: Organizing. Organizing, prioritizing the conversations and the dialog that help us undo patriarchy and developing new practices, and, the fact that Richard has his entire group, that is their stage and a group that is talking about patriarchy and its negative impacts on the men who are in that group that they can feel powerful and it's so necessary.

The shooting occurred during the first event of the Madden eSports season. The shooting could prompt a re-evaluation of security measures at the growing number of esports tournaments. The gaming community reacted in shock and sadness on Sunday, after a mass shooting at a Florida esports event left three people dead. The shooting turned what had been a good-natured season-opening event for a league of passionate Madden football players into the latest scene of carnage resulting from a mass shooting in the US. ""It's heartbreaking,"" said esports journalist and consultant Rod ""Slasher"" Breslau. ""It's very hurtful to have these kinds of issues that we see everyday here as Americans, and now it's coming directly home."" The tournament, which was taking place at a bar in the Jacksonville Landing outdoor mall, was hosted by Electronic Arts, the publisher of the Madden video game franchise. The event was the first of four regional qualifiers for the Madden Championship event slated for later this year in Las Vegas. The event featured several professional players as well as dozens of aspiring esports players. While esports has grown into a more than $500 million industry according to Goldman Sachs, the leagues based on real-world sports like football and basketball are generally considered smaller than the leagues for fantasy and first-person-shooter games such as Call of Duty and Dota 2. But news of the tragedy quickly spread across the broader industry of video gamers and esports contestants.

The shooting was captured on camera, with several gunshots heard before the feed was disconnected. ""There were nine victims transported by JFRD (local fire and rescue) to area hospitals. Some of those have gunshot wounds. There were two additional gunshot victims that self-transported themselves to local hospitals”, said Sheriff Mike Williams. Three events have been cancelled by EA so the firm can conduct a ""comprehensive review of safety protocols” amid criticism over the lack of security at the event. EA chief executive Andrew Wilson said in a statement that “this is the first time we’ve had to confront something like this as an organization, and I believe the first time our gaming community has dealt with a tragedy of this nature.” He said he was “filled with shock and grief” over the Florida shooting. Taylor Robertson, 28, and Elijah Clayton, 22, who lost their lives this weekend were ""respected, positive and skilled competitors”, he added. Concerns about security at such events have been ongoing. In 2015, two men drove with weapons from Iowa to the Pokémon World Championship in Boston and posted messages about plans to carry out “another Boston massacre”. In December, the Call of Duty World League tournament held in Dallas was evacuated - twice - due to bomb threats. Competitor Derek Jones of Santa Fe, New Mexico, was sitting outside the venue on Sunday when he heard the gunshots. He said he didn’t notice any security at the venue - something that he has complained about in the past. “I’ve been telling them this for a while that you need to make the players feel safe,” Jones said. Story continues Industry insiders claim security hasn't caught up with the popularity of eSports. The market was valued at $1.5 billion in 2017 and global eSports revenue is expected to grow 26pc by 2020 “Unfortunately, this was a matter of when not if. Esport event security, in general, has been extremely poor over the years, we should’ve stepped it up long ago,' wrote Cristian Tamas, the director of esports programs for Twitch, the platform that broadcasts gamers’ live streams. “I’ve been saying events NEED better security,” Seth Abner, a popular “Call of Duty” player, tweeted. “Such a damn shame that now event coordinators will respond after a tragedy happens. Thoughts are with everyone at the Madden tournament and their families.” BREAKING: Madden Tournament participant Marquis Williams from Chicago tells @FCN2go he was from 50 feet from the shooter. pic.twitter.com/UrDR8c6o5m — Eric Alvarez (@FCNEric) August 26, 2018 The cancelled events were qualifying heats for EA’s Madden Classic gaming tournament. The event, which was due to take place in October, had a prize pot worth $165,000 (£127,000). The Jacksonville, Florida event was held at a venue named Chicago Pizza, which was live-streaming the tournament on Amazon-owned game streaming platform Twitch when at least nine shots were heard. Investigators are examining video clips posted online that appeared to capture the scene right before the shooting began, Sheriff Williams said. Twitch has since removed video clips which showed the moment the shooting began.

History provides moments where real change is possible, and the thousands of students who participated in organized walkouts all throughout the state are seizing the moment and admirably standing up for the safety of their classmates and students across the country. In the last 24 hours, there have been several reports of New York State schools disciplining students and faculty for participating in yesterday’s historic events to stop gun violence. In at least one disturbing incident, it was reported that the school physically blocked the exits to prevent students from demonstrating. These actions send a terrible message to New York’s children and are against constitutional free speech protections. I call on you to use SED’s authority to stop these schools, reverse course and cease any disciplinary actions. Peaceful expression of views on controversial issues that is not disruptive or threatening is a right that all students have in this country, and any attempts to stifle this speech violates the constitutional rights of students and faculty to free speech. Threatening to discipline students for participating in the peaceful demonstrations is not only inappropriate, it is unconstitutional. Reports that schools may also discipline faculty are also highly concerning and would send a terrible message to our students. The students who participated in the walkout are trying to advance laws and actions that would save their lives, and many viewed their participation as necessary to their own safety. The scourge of mass shootings in schools is very real, and these students were taking proactive steps to protect themselves and their classmates. These actions, coupled with the peaceful manner in which the demonstrations were conducted, is something that should be lauded, not punished. Additionally, I call on you to thoroughly investigate any reports of schools that blocked the exits to physically prevent students from leaving during the event. This an egregious safety violation and it is also unlawful. Yesterday’s actions were a testament to the courage and leadership of New York’s students. As I said yesterday, these young people are showing more leadership than the so-called leaders in Washington. To punish or discipline them is inconsistent with the freedom of expression that we cherish. It would say more about the adults imposing discipline than it would about the students who exercised their rights to speak out. Sincerely, Governor Andrew M.

News of the crisis spread quickly throughout the national media and the Twittersphere. By the time officials gave the “all clear,” it became apparent that a planned active shooter training exercise had been mistaken for the real thing. Although actual active shooter events can be devastating, the level of fear associated with this modern-day boogeyman is out of control, leading to countless false alarms: ►An unfounded report of an active shooter inside a California hospital Wednesday prompted a “code black” lockdown of the facility and a massive police response. ►An attempted robbery of a jewelry store on July 28 inside a Texas mall created havoc when the sound of breaking glass was mistaken for an active shooter event, sending terrified shoppers rushing for the exits. ►As fireworks lit up the sky above Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, last July Fourth, word spread through the crowd that there was an active shooter among them, sending thousands running for their lives. However, there was no shooting and no gunman — just folks misinterpreting the sound of firecrackers. Satanic cults, child abductions by strangers, pedophile daycare workers — all were at some point considered threats of some magnitude, albeit small. Yet, in classic moral panic fashion, frightened Americans overstated the risk and embraced overresponse. Of course, anyone who sits in a classroom or at his desk at work, or who visits a shopping mall or restaurant, faces the possibility of confronting an armed assailant. But the likelihood is akin to that of being killed by lightning. How did we get to the point where the term “active shooter,” a relatively recent addition to our lexicon, reflects a menace of intense concern? In recent years, the FBI has produced a series of reports on active shooter events, dispelling a number of common misconceptions. For example, the latest update indicated that, contrary to what many believe, active shooters are generally not driven by serious mental illness. Moreover, they tend to target specific victims as opposed to shooting indiscriminately. Are there really more active shooters? The FBI statistics remain dubious, however, in terms of the reported increase over the past two decades, which has many observers thinking in epidemic terms. According to the FBI database, partially assembled by accessing news archives, the number of active shooters — defined as a gunman “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in populated areas” — grew from one case in 2000 (the massacre of seven employees in Wakefield, Massachusetts) to an average of dozens over the past few years. Is the increase in actual cases or in the ability to locate cases from years gone by, especially when the press was not so vigilant in reporting on armed assailants who, despite their intentions, failed to kill lots of people? It is hard to fathom that in 2000, there was not more than one person in this entire nation who picked up a loaded gun with the desire to kill many people in a public place. Actually, there was, among others, a Pittsburgh man who killed five in a hate-inspired rampage. He just didn't make the FBI database. More:Mom of school shooting hero says she 'would hug' the shooter's parents After Texas school shooting, how can we inoculate ourselves against the next one? Danger in overreacting to Santa Fe school shooting In the four years since the FBI began surveying active shooter events, 27 percent of assailants failed to kill anyone. In the first four years of the FBI database (2000-03), only 9 percent killed no one. Either active shooters of recent vintage are poorer marksmen, or the less serious cases of earlier years were not identified. The other factor driving misperceptions of risk is the over-the-top news coverage. As in the recent episode at YouTube headquarters, as soon as the 911 calls arrive, satellite trucks and helicopters are dispatched to the scene transmitting live images into living rooms across America. Our fear doesn't match the level of risk As a result, the level of fear is well out of proportion with the risk. For example, a recent poll of residents of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, found that two-thirds feared that an active shooter would strike at a local school. Sadly, there was indeed an attack, but instead of striking a school as residents feared, he struck the very newspaper that published the survey results. Although fear can sometimes encourage taking reasonable precautions, in the case of moral panics, the steps are often useless, of questionable value, or even counterproductive. Consider these examples: ►Some schools, despite limited budgets, are purchasing active shooter insurance in case of liability. ►For school teachers, a few hours of training at a shooting range and simulated exercises hardly qualifies them to be prepared sufficiently for the real thing. ►It is debatable whether active shooter drills in schools and workplaces really help, but they certainly can arouse fear. The message is: “We wouldn’t be doing these drills were we not in real danger.” Inadvertently, the drills can also inform a disgruntled student or employee of the best attack strategy. ►In 2016, Michigan established an active shooter alert system patterned after the Amber Alert. Unlike kidnappers, active shooters rarely venture very far or remain active for long. Widely broadcasting an alert could do more to frighten than protect citizens. Overall, the most significant downsides to our hypervigilance are the constant reminder of danger and the possibility of false alarms. Plus, the more we obsess over active shooters, the more we entice angry individuals to seek redress with a gun.

Trump spoke to Senator John Cornyn, a Republican, on Friday about a bipartisan bill that he and Democratic Senator Chris Murphy introduced to improve federal compliance with criminal background checks, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. ""While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the president is supportive of efforts to improve the federal background check system,"" Sanders said in a statement. Students, many using the mantra NeverAgain, are mobilizing around the country in favor of stronger gun laws after the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history took place on Wednesday at Florida's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a former student is accused of murdering 17 people using an assault-style rifle. Previous mass shootings in the United States have also stirred outrage and calls for action to tighten U.S. gun laws, with few results in Congress. Trump, who visited survivors of the shooting and law enforcement officials on Friday night before spending the weekend at his property in Palm Spring, Florida, is a strong supporter of gun rights and won the endorsement of the National Rifle Association, the powerful gun lobby group, for his 2016 presidential campaign. He angered some students by suggesting in a tweet on Saturday that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had missed signs that the school shooter was troubled because it was distracted by its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The FBI has acknowledged it failed to act on a tip flagging concerns about the suspect, Nikolas Cruz. Many Republicans generally oppose measures to tighten gun restrictions, citing the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protection of the right to bear arms. Story continues Former President Barack Obama and many of his fellow Democrats unsuccessfully pushed to pass gun control legislation after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012. Cornyn and Murphy introduced their bill to improve federal background checks last November, days after a gunman killed more than two dozen people in a church in Texas. The bill, called the Fix NICS Act, would ensure that states and federal agencies comply with existing law on reporting criminal history records to the national background check system. Cornyn, of Texas, had complained when introducing the legislation that compliance by agencies was “lousy.” Students are planning a ""March For Our Lives"" in Washington on March 24 to call attention to school safety and ask lawmakers to enact gun control. [nL2N1Q900C] Some students reacted with caution to Trump's support on background checks. “We want to prevent mass shootings from happening and while this could have happened with other types of weapons, NeverAgain believes school safety should be priority right now, not just background checks,"" said Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Kali Clougherty, 18, referring to a campaign for gun control. ""This is about the victims. Don’t forget that; we never will."" Trump is scheduled to host a ""listening session"" with high school students and teachers on Wednesday. Dozens of high school students protested in front of the White House on Monday, chanting “We want safe schools!” and “Hey! Hey! NRA how many kids did you kill today?” Crystal Jordan, a 15-year old from Spotsylvania, Virginia, said it was scary to go to school now. “It’s OK to obtain a gun, like a handgun, but not an assault rifle,” she said, adding that she hoped Trump and Congress would issue laws to strengthen background checks, ban assault rifles and prevent people with mental problems from accessing guns.

""I’m not going to be a Gabby Giffords,"" said Norman, 64, referring to the former congresswoman from Arizona who was shot in the head during a meet-and-greet outside a grocery store in 2011. Giffords was gravely wounded in that attack. She survived and became a prominent gun safety advocate. Both Giffords and her husband, retired Nasa astronaut Mark Kelly, are longtime gun owners. ""Americans are increasingly faced with a stark choice: leaders like Gabby, who work hard together to find solutions to problems, or extremists like the NRA and Congressman Norman, who rely on intimidation tactics and perpetuating fear,"" Kelly said in a statement.

But whoever shoots me better shoot well or I’m shooting back."" Norman’s indelicate reference to Giffords appeared to suggest that her debilitating injury was in some way due to her not being adequately armed.

364,10891,http://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/05/politics/congress-week-ahead-dodd-frank-banking-bill/index.html,This week in Congress: Gun debate takes back seat,"Washington (CNN) The Senate will not formally debate gun legislation this week despite calls to action from lawmakers on both sides in the aftermath of the deadly Parkland, Florida, mass shooting, but informal talks over a possible path are expected to intensify and should be a major focus on Capitol Hill. Despite the broad push to quickly pass gun legislation, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will move to other business while negotiations continue on what if anything can be done on. ""We'd love to do that at some point,"" the Kentucky Republican said about the still undefined gun legislation. ""I'm hoping there is a way forward."" Instead, McConnell is planning a debate and votes on a bill that would provide the most significant changes yet to the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory law , which passed under President Barack Obama after the 2008 financial crisis. The bill includes provisions that would loosen regulations placed on smaller and mid-size banks, easing their ability to lend money. Supporters of the plan believe that smaller community banks should not be confined to the same rules as the mega-banks of Wall Street. The bipartisan bill, authored by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, an Idaho Republican, already has the 60 votes needed to pass in the Senate, but Republican leaders must make sure they won't lose anyone if any changes were to be made to the bill before the vote. Why the gun debate stalled Following the NRA meeting, the President called Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, to reiterate his support for Cornyn's proposal, which would improve federal background checks by incentivizing better reporting to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System -- a bill known as ""Fix NICS."" The plan, which is narrower in scope than other gun-related proposals, may be the one measure under consideration that can pass the House and Senate. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia told CNN on Sunday that he believes Trump would support a more comprehensive bill from him and GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania to expand background checks on gun sales. ""I really believe he would,"" Manchin said on CNN's ""State of the Union. ""In my heart of hearts I believe that."" That measure however is a revival of a bill that failed in 2013, and it's unclear if the Manchin-Toomey plan could garner 60 votes this time. In the House, Democrats are expected to push House Speaker Paul Ryan to take up gun control measures next week, and could try to use procedural tactics on the House floor to keep up the public pressure. But Ryan continued to say he and other GOP leaders will await any action from the Senate on the issue before moving anything. Trump's tariff battle In trade news, Republican senators expressed serious concerns for the President's announcement last week to impose tariffs on steels and aluminum, citing fears of retaliation. Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said in a statement , ""Make no mistake: If the President goes through with this, it will kill American jobs -- that's what every trade war ultimately does. So much losing."" Cornyn echoed concerns about retaliation and ""unintended consequences,"" while Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin called for ""fair and reciprocal trade,"" and reiterated his support of NAFTA, saying it is ""extremely important to us as is keeping globally competitive steel and aluminum products, making those available to our workers."" Trump is expected to make a formal announcement about the tariffs this week. Many of the free-trade Republicans who are concerned about the fallout of the tariffs, are holding out hope Trump changes his mind before that happens. Security clearances The Senate Intelligence Committee will hold an open hearing -- including both industry and Executive Branch officials -- to address ""complexities in the security clearance process for both government and industry."" While the timing of the hearing could raise some eyebrows in light of the security clearance issues that have plagued the White House , sources tell CNN that the hearing has been in the works for months, though questions about White House adviser Jared Kushner's clearance are expected. Other events around the Hill On Monday, former ""Daily Show"" host and First Responder advocate Jon Stewart will hold a news conference on Capitol Hill to ""to call on OMB Director Mick Mulvaney to withdraw his ill-thought out proposal to separate the World Trade Center Health Program from National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health direction."" He will be joined by members of the New York congressional delegation. The House of Representatives is voting on legislation to reauthorize the Federal Communications Commission and could also take up a bill renewing intelligence programs. Members of the President's Cabinet head to the Capitol on Tuesday -- Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta will testify before their respective House Appropriations subcommittees for their departments' annual budget hearings.

On Monday, he sent a letter to U.S. Attorneys, ordering them to meet with the top agent at the local Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives office and coordinate on boosting prosecution of so-called lie-and-try cases. “Criminals and other prohibited persons who attempt to thwart the background check process by lying on the required forms threaten to undermine this important crime prevention tool,” Sessions wrote. “Such conduct cannot be tolerated. “We must vigilantly protect the integrity of the background check system through appropriate prosecution of those who attempt to circumvent the law.” The Justice Department is also offering up to $1 million in emergency grant funding to Broward County and other jurisdictions that responded to the shooting at the high school in Parkland, Florida, last month.

1140,10272,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/florida-stopped-doing-gun-permit-checks-for-more-than-a-year,Florida stopped doing gun permit checks for more than a year,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — For more than a year, Florida failed to do national background checks that could have disqualified people from gaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The lapse, revealed in an internal report that was not widely known about until Friday, occurred during a time period when there was a significant surge in the number of people seeking permission to legally carry a concealed weapon. Florida does not allow the open carry of weapons, but more than 1.9 million have permits to carry guns and weapons in public if they are concealed. The state ultimately revoked 291 permits and fired an employee blamed for the lapse after an inspector general’s report detailing the problem was sent in June 2017 to top officials in the department who oversee the program. The Tampa Bay Times was the first to publish information about the report, which pointed out that the state failed to check the National Instant Criminal Background Check System from February 2016 to March 2017. Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, a Republican running for governor who has touted his efforts to make it easier for people to obtain concealed-weapons permits, said the state did conduct its own criminal background checks on those applying for permits during that time period. Putnam blamed the problem on the negligence of a department employee. “The former employee was both deceitful and negligent, and we immediately launched an investigation and implemented safeguards to ensure this never happens again,” Putnam said in a statement. McKinley Lewis, a spokesman for Republican Gov. Rick Scott, said the governor’s office was never provided a copy of the inspector general’s report. Democrats and gun control advocates quickly criticized Putnam over the incident and said he should resign. Putnam has raised the ire of gun control advocates for his proclamation last year that he was a “proud NRA sellout” who supports the National Rifle Association. He also said that he would not have signed the new gun and school safety law enacted by the Florida Legislature in the aftermath of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. “Career politicians like Mr. Putnam think this is just another bad day at the office — but when you conceal a level of negligence that endangers every resident, and every child, in Florida, you forfeit any moral right to lead,” said former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, one of the Democratic candidates running for governor. The state used the national system to see if there were reasons such as mental illness or drug addictions that should prevent someone from being issued a concealed-weapons permit. But in March 2017 an investigation was triggered after a state employee noted that the state was not getting any correspondence from people whose applications had been rejected due to information gleaned from the national database. The final report issued in June 2017 states that an employee in the Division of Licensing did not run applications through the national system because she couldn’t log into the database. The employee is quoted in the report as saying that she “dropped the ball.” The Times interviewed the employee, Lisa Wilde, who told them she was working in the mailroom when she was given oversight of the database in 2013. “I didn’t understand why I was put in charge of it,” Wilde told the newspaper. Statistics compiled by the department show that from the summer of 2015 to the summer of 2017, the number of new applications for concealed-weapon permits jumped dramatically, to its highest level in 25 years.",Shooting Shooting range Gun Weapon  2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting Aurora Illinois shooting Florida Firearms license Police,A map of the state’s gun department in the state’s top department.,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — For more than a year, Florida failed to do national background checks that could have disqualified people from gaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon.

625,10131,http://thehill.com/regulation/368425-planned-shift-on-gun-exports-kicks-up-storm,Planned shift on gun exports kicks up storm,"The Trump administration’s expected plan to transfer the licensing of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department has Democratic lawmakers and foreign policy advocates readying for a fight. The proposal under review by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has yet to be made public, but experts fear it will lead to less oversight of commercial sales of assault weapons like submachine guns and flame throwers to foreign buyers. ADVERTISEMENT Less oversight, they warn, could make it easier for deadly weapons to end up in the hands of terrorists and drug cartels. “It’s a major change,” said Colby Goodman, director of the Security Assistance Monitor program at the Center for International Policy. “It’s opening up a lot more risk and a lot more opportunity for illegal and illicit trafficking.” The State Department said it is shifting responsibility to Commerce for approving exports of nonmilitary firearms and ammunition that are already commercially available — those under Categories I, II and III on the U.S. Munitions List. The goal is to reduce regulatory burdens on manufacturers and exporters. Under the proposed rules, an administration official told The Hill, firearms and related articles that are uniquely military or that are not otherwise widely available for commercial sale would remain under State Department export licensing controls. In shifting oversight, exporters and manufacturers, including small gunsmiths, would no longer have to register with the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and pay the $2,250 annual registration fee. But experts say if exporters aren’t forced to register with the federal government, there will be no way to track and no one to prosecute when weapons end up in the wrong hands. “There are plenty of cases when in regular processes weapons have been lost,” said Jeff Abramson, a nonresident senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, adding that these are the weapons often used in human rights abuses. Democrats are particularly upset with one potential change in the proposal. Shifting oversight from the State Department to the Commerce Department, they say, would eliminate congressional review that’s now required under the Arms Export Control Act for any commercial sales of lethal weapons worth $1 million or more. “As you are aware, combat firearms and ammunition are uniquely lethal; they are easily spread and easily modified, and are the primary means of injury, death and destruction in civil and military conflicts throughout the world,” Sens.

In an interview with The Hill, Torres said the Commerce Department has a very different role than the State Department, which leads on foreign affairs. “[Commerce’s] interest is selling U.S.-made goods,” she said. “They aren’t looking at things from a public safety point of view.” Torres said the types of weapons being sold could cause a lot of problems in countries where democracy is fragile. “The State Department has more knowledge about what’s happening on the ground,” she said. The administration, however, disagrees. “The Commerce Department is uniquely qualified to handle these rule changes,” the administration official said in an email to The Hill. “In fact, the Department of Commerce has decades of experience in licensing firearms for export under the Export Administration Regulations. This involves the export, re-export, and transfer (in-country) of 12-gauge shotguns, optical sighting devices for firearms, and crime control equipment.” The official said each export license would go through a rigorous interagency review process that includes the Defense and State departments to ensure national security and human rights concerns are addressed. “The proposed changes will allow the Commerce Department to use its expertise and resources through its in-agency law enforcement unit, and its robust end use verification program,” the official said. “This transfer will not create opportunities to put weapons in the hands of bad actors.” Gun manufacturers and former Obama administration officials say the hysteria over the rule is overblown and premature. The rule, after all, has been in the works since 2012 and is expected to mimic an Obama-era proposal that was slated for release, but stalled after 20 children and six adults were killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Kevin Wolf, the former assistant secretary of Commerce for export administration, said gun rights and gun control groups should relax until they’ve seen the actual wording of the rule. “Everybody just chill,” he said. “Anyone who has any concerns should just relax until they see an actual rule to comment on.” Larry Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said he’s been told the current rule isn’t significantly or materially different than the Obama-era proposal. “It is disingenuous for people like Sen. Cardin and other Democrats to now complain about the policy when the rules were over at [the Office of Management and Budget] and within hours of being published” under Obama, he said. A former administration official familiar with the rule discussions said export licenses still would have been required for assault weapons under the Obama-era rule. Licensing requirements would have been eased, however, for the less sensitive gun parts like screws and springs. “The assumption is the Commerce Department is less restrictive, but the difference is less sensitive items can be treated less sensitively, but more lethal items can be treated more aggressively,” the former official said. The push to change the rules is supported by the National Rifle Association, which says many people who never intend to export a firearm or firearm accessories, like gunsmiths and parts manufacturers, are now required to register with the State Department and pay high fees to operate their business. “The NRA supports the Trump administration’s efforts to complete the reforms and transfer law-abiding firearms and ammunition manufacturers from an export system designed for nuclear submarines and ballistic missiles into one designed around lawful commercial products,” said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker. The State Department’s proposed rule was sent to OIRA on Sept. 26 and is marked as pending review. The office has 90 days to review the rule, but that deadline can be extended indefinitely by the head of the rulemaking agency. The Office of Management and Budget, which oversees OIRA, said it has a longstanding policy of not commenting on rules under review.",Firearm Assault rifle Gun Gun violence Machine gun Rifle Airsoft Guns Trigger National Rifle Association DAX MONTHLY HEDGED TR JPY,A gun used by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.,"The Trump administration’s expected plan to transfer the licensing of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department has Democratic lawmakers and foreign policy advocates readying for a fight.

She began smelling and inhaling smoke and gunpowder, and then one of her classmates fell in front of her. ""I then placed myself underneath his lifeless body,"" she will say. She expressed concern about Kavanaugh's nomination and recalled Parkland father Fred Guttenberg's encounter with Kavanaugh earlier this week. Guttenberg accused Kavanaugh of ignoring him as he tried to shake his hand. Sources close to Kavanaugh pushed back saying the nominee had no idea who the man, Fred Guttenberg, was and that security intervened to end the exchange. Eastmond talked about phone calls she made to her own parents. ""I immediately called my mom. I told her my last goodbye, and I told her how much I loved her. I apologized for all the things I might've done in my lifetime to upset her, and the phone hung up. I then called my father, I told him how much I loved him, I told him to tell my brothers I love them, and I said my last goodbyes,"" she testified. She also spoke about emerging from the school and finding a friend and her mom. ""They called the police over, and they began picking body matter from my hair."" Kavanaugh will not be in the hearing room Friday but has testified that violence in schools is something we all ""detest."" Democrats have pushed him on an opinion he wrote in 2011 on gun control. Kavanaugh dissented from a majority opinion of the DC Circuit that upheld a ban that applied to semiautomatic rifles in the District of Columbia. He relied on Supreme Court precedent and wrote that the Court had held that ""handguns -- the vast majority of which today are semi-automatic -- are constitutionally protected because they have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens."" During his testimony he acknowledged that people ""passionately disagree"" with the Supreme Court's precedent. But that as a lower court judge ""I'm following all the precedent."" He said that in his opinion he explained in ""painstaking detail"" why he thought the test he applied in the case was appropriate. And he said that the Supreme Court opinion -- ""allowed a lot of gun regulation, machine guns can be banned"" he said as well as laws prohibiting possession by the people with mental illness and in government buildings and schools. He spoke about growing up in the Washington, DC, area that has been ""plagued by, in the '70s and '80s, plagued by gang and gun, drug violence, and it's known for a while as the murder capital of the world. "" Eastmond advised senators: ""As you make your final decision, think about it as if you had to justify and defend your choice to those who we lost to gun violence.

1293,110432,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/michigan-university-profs-fight-off-195822648.html,Michigan University Profs To Fight Off School Shooters With -- Hockey Pucks?,"Sometimes the only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a ― hockey puck? That’s the theory at Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Michigan, where faculty members are being trained to fight school shooters using, among other things, hockey pucks. OU Police Chief Mark Gordon told local station WDIV-TV, the pucks are being given to teachers and students to throw at school shooters and cause a distraction. Gordon knows something of which he speaks. As a former youth hockey coach, he told the Detroit News he was once hit in the head with a puck. It “caused a fair amount of damage to me,” he said. Hockey pucks are perfect for defense, he said, though he acknowledged he knows of no research on using pucks in active shooter situations. They’re heavy enough to cause damage and compact enough to be carried in backpacks, but aren’t considered weapons by law enforcement. “Anything that you can throw that’s heavy and will cause damage, cause injury is the bottom line of what you’re trying to do,” Gordon said, according to the Detroit Free Press. A hockey puck “was just a thing that was suggested that could possibly work, especially when you have 20 or 30 people in a classroom and they all throw hockey pucks at the same time ― it would be quite the distraction.” Faculty member Garry J. Gilbert admitted he was skeptical about the puck plan. “My first reaction was: You are talking about facing an assault weapon and asking us to fight back with hockey pucks? It sounded silly,” Gilbert told the Detroit News. “Then I went through the training session, and it all made sense. None of us want to face an armed assailant. Students will look to us for leadership in a situation like that.” The training encourages the faculty to flee if possible, and hide if not. “If we have to do that (fight), Chief Gordon has shown us you can surprise or disarm an assailant with an object. Grab anything you’ve got ... a stapler or book ... anything you’ve got and be prepared and charge him,” Gilbert said. “Maybe he can be distracted by having things thrown at him, and you can limit injuries and loss of life. It won me over.” It also won over the university’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which is distributing 2,500 hockey pucks to its members and students, according to WDIV-TV. The union is selling hockey pucks to raise funds to equip all campus classroom doors with locks that can be used without leaving the room in the event of an emergency. The unending wave of mass shootings targeting students also is prompting other ideas that don’t involve firearms. Pennsylvania’s Blue Mountain School District in March equipped all of its classrooms with a five-gallon bucket of rocks. Anyone attempting a school shooting, the superintendent said, “will be stoned.” Meanwhile, sales of bulletproof backpacks reportedly are soaring.

""The Liberator Code Book: An Exercise in the Freedom of Speech,"" appeared on Amazon's website on August 1. The company said it dropped the $20 book on Wednesday because it violated Amazon's content guidelines, but it would not offer further details. ""Code is speech,"" the apparent author, ""CJ Awelow,"" wrote in a brief description on Amazon, echoing the legal argument made by the organization behind the code. ""Proceeds will be used to fight for free speech and the right to bear arms."" The company's decision to drop the 584-page book, while continuing to offer books like The Anarchist's Cookbook and a United States Army field guide to improvised munitions, represents the latest twist in an ongoing legal fight over 3D printed firearms. The issue erupted in 2013, when Cody Wilson, a self-described anarchist who founded the gun-rights organization Defense Distributed, posted the code needed to 3D-print a handgun called the Liberator. The US State Department soon sent Wilson a cease and desist letter, ordering him to remove the instructions from his website. Wilson sued the agency 2015, claiming it was infringing on his First and Second Amendment rights. The government settled the case in June, and Wilson planned to publish the code needed to create a variety of firearms on August 1. A federal judge granted a temporary national injunction on July 31 barring him from doing so. Amazon's ban speaks to a broader issue facing platforms such as Facebook and retailers such as Amazon as they attempt to police the content appearing on their sites. Some critics of Amazon's decision took to social media to note that the company offers a wide range of other controversial books, including Mein Kampf. ""This is one [sic] again a huge blow to our first amendment. If you want change, act now,"" Defense Distributed tweeted Wednesday night. Wilson envisions Defense Distributed as a place for anyone to share or download blueprints for firearms, leading to new types of weapons. ""I don't believe that access to information is ever tremendously negative or a bad thing,"" Wilson told CNN in a recent interview. ""People can use information for bad things.

The suspect -- identified as a 46-year-old Robert Bowers -- reportedly yelled ""All Jews must die"" as he sprayed bullets into the Tree of Life synagogue during Sabbath services on Saturday before exchanging fire with police, in an attack that also wounded six people. He was taken into custody and transferred to hospital before being charged by US prosecutors over the bloodshed, including with 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder and 11 counts of obstructing the exercise of religion resulting in death. President Donald Trump denounced ""a wicked act of mass murder,"" while his daughter Ivanka, a convert to Judaism, declared: ""America is stronger than the acts of a depraved bigot and anti-Semite."" ""This evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us,"" Trump told supporters at an election rally in Illinois where he drew loud cheers as he vowed to fully enforce the death penalty for such crimes. ""We must stand with our Jewish brothers and sisters to defeat anti-Semitism and vanquish the forces of hate."" Trump said he would soon travel to Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, where hundreds held a candlelit vigil late Saturday. The president ordered all flags at the White House and at public grounds, military posts and naval stations to be flown at half-staff through October 31 as a mark of ""solemn respect"" for the victims. - 'Sickening' - Stephen Weiss, a 60-year-old member of the congregation, described hearing dozens of shots coming from the synagogue's front lobby. ""We had services going on in the chapel when we heard a loud noise,"" he told the Tribune-Review newspaper. ""I recognized it as gunshots."" Authorities said Bowers was armed with an assault rifle and at least three handguns when he opened fire shortly before 10:00 am (1400 GMT) Saturday. Story continues Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh's public safety director described the scene after the attack as ""horrific"". ""One of the worst that I've seen. I've been on plane crashes,"" said Hissrich, who confirmed that 11 people were killed, and six injured. No children were among the casualties. ""Hate Has No Home Here,"" read a placard in a simple memorial, next to a heart-shaped US flag -- the same slogan was repeated in Hebrew and Arabic, with candles and bouquets of pink roses and carnations. ""It's sickening. Outside of just the evil factor of it, who wakes up on a Saturday morning to do that?"" said Pittsburgh chef Nathan, 42, who came to pay his respects but refused to give his second name. The United States is witnessing a sharp spike in anti-Semitic incidents, surging 57 percent from 2016 to 2017, to 1,986 from 1,267, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a civil rights group which has tracked anti-Semitism in the United States since the 1970s. The ADL said it believes the Pittsburgh shooting to be the deadliest such attack in US history. ""We are devastated,"" said the group's head Jonathan Greenblatt. ""Our hearts break for the victims, their families, and the entire Jewish community."" Bowers, who the FBI said was not previously known to law enforcement, appeared to be the author of a rash of anti-Semitic online posts, notably on the Gab.com website, where conspiracy theories are common. - 'Toxic place to live' - A quote atop the Bowers page said ""jews are the children of satan,"" according to screenshots of the now-suspended account released by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist movements. Bowers faces a total of 29 charges, which authorities said could carry the death penalty. ""The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes,"" a US prosecutor statement said. Saturday's attack comes at a time of heightened tensions -- a day after a Trump supporter from Florida was arrested for mailing explosive devices to Democrats and liberals, setting the country on edge ahead of close-fought elections on November 6. Trump has been accused of fueling hate with divisive rhetoric. ""I think our president's totally dividing us,"" said Nathan, the chef who came to pay his respects in Pittsburgh. ""If he doesn't take some type of responsibility, shame on him. He's making our place a very toxic place to live."" The attack drew condemnation and messages of solidarity from world leaders, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declaring himself ""heartbroken and appalled."" German Chancellor Angela Merkel slammed an act of ""blind anti-Semitic hatred."" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for a united front ""to roll back the forces of racism, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and other forms of hatred."" The Tree of Life Synagogue, whose congregation was founded more than 150 years ago, is located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood that is historically the heart of Jewish life in greater Pittsburgh. Neighbors in the quiet neighborhood came out of their homes to provide police with coffee to stave off the drizzle as officers manned road blocks, sealing off all approaches to the scene.

Black Security Guard Shot Dead By Police After Subduing and Disarming Gunman,"A police officer responding to a shooting at an Illinois bar shot and killed a black security guard who had managed to disarm and subdue the suspect. Police were called after a gunfight broke out at Manny's Blue Room Bar in Robbins, just south of Chicago, at around 4 a.m. on November 11. Eyewitnesses said that 26-year-old Jemel Roberson managed to apprehend one of the men involved in the fight, take away his gun and force him to the ground. When officers arrived at the scene, Roberson still had the suspect subdued with his knee and licensed gun pressed against his back. According to witness Adam Harris, a Midlothian officer arrived at the scene and fired at Roberson when he saw him holding the suspect to the ground with his weapon. ""Everybody was screaming out, 'Security!' He was a security guard,"" Harris told WGN-TV. ""And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him."" Midlothian police confirmed that an officer had ""encountered a subject with a gun"" and was involved in a shooting. ""The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,"" Chief Daniel Delaney of the Midlothian Police Department said in a statement. Four other people were injured during the incident, including the man believed to have fired the gun before officers arrived, Cook County Sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari told the Associated Press. The suspect, who has not been named, remains in hospital with injuries. The Illinois State Police have since taken over the handling of the investigation. Roberson, a 2010 graduate of Lane Tech High School who played on the school's basketball team, is reported to have been an aspiring police officer himself, according to CBS Chicago. ""Jemel had a big smile and a bigger heart. You will be missed,"" Lane Tech Basketball said in a tribute posted on Twitter. Roberson worked as a gospel musician at several churches. ""We called him choir boy—everybody called him choir boy,"" neighbor John Montgomery told CBS Chicago. A GoFundMe page set up to collect donations for Roberson's family has since gone on to raise more than $27,000. ""Jemel Roberson was a young man who was greatly loved by all who knew him,"" the description page reads. ""He was the light of his mother Beatrice's life, and was a devoted loving son. Jemel was a gifted basketball player and musician, and his love for God and his family were at the forefront of his life. ""Sadly, Jemel's life was tragically and unexpectedly cut short this morning as he tried to save others from senseless violence.

The alleged gunman, Robert Bowers, was a deeply committed far-right anti-Semite, and surrounded himself online with other anti-Semites. He based his reasoning for his murder spree on a conspiracy theory that the migrant caravan currently working its way through Mexico is a Jewish plot intended to destabilize America, a theory that has its own lengthy history. Anti-Semitism is an ancient form of hate, stretching back for millennia and leaving ghettos, pogroms, and mass industrialized murder in its wake. And the language of the anti-Semitism of the Wannsee Conference is being repeated today, on 4chan and by far-right mayoral candidates alike. Bowers posted online that he had lost his faith in President Donald Trump because Trump hadn’t supported white supremacist groups, sharing a post that read in part, “First Trump came for the Charlottesville 4 but I kept supporting Trump because he is better than Hillary Clinton.” But though the Pittsburgh shooter ultimately rejected Trump — and to be clear, Trump’s daughter and son-in-law and their family are practicing Orthodox Jews — Bowers was present in a political moment when prominent figures, from Fox News hosts to Trump surrogates and even Trump himself, have encouraged and even enabled conspiracy theories to flourish, including birtherism, QAnon, and Trump’s accusations about the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) being involved in murdering John F. Kennedy. An environment where conspiracy theories flourish and find new ground is the perfect environment for anti-Semitism itself to flourish and find new acolytes. Anti-Semitism is a distinct form of hate, one deeply rooted in conspiracies about the role Jewish people play in shaping public life. But moreover, anti-Semitism itself is a conspiracy theory. How anti-Semitism is different from other forms of hate Anti-Semitism in America is a form of hate, but its motivations aren’t identical to other forms of prejudice. For example, while anti-black racism or white supremacy revolve around on the (wrong) idea that black people or nonwhites are inferior, anti-Semitism, as practiced by many of its adherents today from a number of political and social backgrounds, is based on the idea that Jewish people have too much power, or even that Jewish people are secretly in charge — of the government, of culture, of the world in its entirety. I spoke with Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project and an expert on far-right white supremacist organizations. “In general, racism against people of color tends to denigrate their abilities or ascribe criminality to them,” Beirich told me. “With Jewish people, it is more often the case that they are seen as nefarious connivers who engage in activities to harm the majority population, meaning white people, by bringing in nonwhite immigrants or refugees.” The idea that Jewish people, or Jews in general, hold secret power over everyone else is widespread among anti-Semites. Nation of Islam’s Louis Farrakhan (himself deeply anti-Semitic) put his views bluntly in February of this year: “The Jews have control over those agencies of government. When you want something in this world, the Jew holds the door.” (Anti-Semitism on the left has its own very worrying history and legacy.) In short, as writer John-Paul Pagano, who has discussed anti-Semitism extensively in his work, put it on Twitter, anti-Semitism is essentially a conspiracy theory. And in our conversation, Beirich agreed, telling me: “The whole anti-Semitic narrative is based on conspiracies. That is the thing that often sets apart anti-Semitism from other forms of hatred.” This is well-intentioned and moving, but wrong. Anti-Semitism is different from most racism in that it ""punches up"" against a perceived oppressor--the Jews, who are cast as a diabolical elite. Anti-Semitism is a conspiracy theory. That's why it leads to salvationist mass murder. https://t.co/RP7bN6afAY — John-Paul Pagano (@johnpaulpagano) October 27, 2018 Kenneth Jacobson, deputy national director for the Anti-Defamation League, told me religious anti-Semitism and racial anti-Semitism have been factors in anti-Semitic language and actions for centuries. (Examples of religious anti-Semitism include blaming Jewish people for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ or accusing Jews of using the blood of Christians in religious rites. In acts of racial anti-Semitism, people sometimes spread fear about Jewish people “contaminating” non-Jewish people’s bloodlines, essentially making a religious group into a race.) Jacobson said that if there’s one thing that differentiates anti-Semitism from racism more broadly, “it’s that racism is largely ‘what you see is what you get,’ but anti-Semitism to a significant degree is not.” A racist sees a nonwhite person and is prejudiced against them. But to anti-Semites, he said, “Jews appear to be normal people but in fact the reality is that there’s something hidden, something powerful, something nefarious. Reality is not what it appears with the Jew.” He added that demagogues the world over have picked up on that theme to argue during crises or turmoil, “what’s really troubling is that the Jew is behind it all.” Anti-Semitism argues not that Jewish people are inferior, but that Jewish people are dangerous. Often those who espouse anti-Semitism use the political interests of any Jewish person, be they left-wing or right-wing, as evidence that their Jewishness is the real basis of their political beliefs and thus, that those beliefs cannot be trusted. The characteristics of far-right anti-Semitism The conspiracy theory that is anti-Semitism has many parts and works in many different ways. For one, the anti-Semitism of the white supremacist far-right argues that Jewish people secretly hate white people — or more generally, “everyday Americans,” generally conservatives — and are attempting to subvert them through politics or through the media, using nonwhite people to do their bidding. Here’s a recent example. In 2016, Trump-supportive musician Ted Nugent a meme posted on Facebook containing photos of prominent Jewish Americans like Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, each with Israeli flags superimposed over their photo and with the tagline, “so who is really behind gun control?” His answer, apparently: Jews. Know these punks. They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us the basic human right to self defense ... Posted by Ted Nugent on Monday, February 8, 2016 Nugent’s point was clear: These people aren’t real Americans interested in gun control for their own personal reasons; rather, they’re trying to rob real Americans of their rights through subversion and lying for selfish purposes — perhaps even doing so on behalf of Israel (as three figures in the meme are explicitly linked to either Israel or “Russian Jews”). As Beirich told me, “Anti-Semites have for centuries accused Jews of being globalists who do not care about the countries that they live in and lack patriotism, instead favoring building up their own worldwide power. In today’s terms, that is called “globalism” and these unpatriotic Jews are seen as driving nations to extinction in favor of their own global power.” “This is the same kind of conspiracy you find in the bogus Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which is read to this day by white supremacists.” The Protocols of the Elders of Zion is a fake document (likely created by Russian secret police in the late 19th century) that purportedly details the secret Jewish plan for world domination. The term “globalism” has been used by self-described “nationalists” — like Trump — and by, say, anti-capitalist protestors, but the false idea of the “rootless” and “globalist” Jewish people who lack real ties to their home countries has a lengthy anti-Semitic history. Anti-Semites view Jewish success as further evidence of the conspiracy theory that Jews are secretly in charge of everything, while arguing that Jewish Americans aren’t “real Americans” and that they are somehow disconnected from traditional American values. These sentiments are hardly new to the American imagination: Henry Ford, the founder of the Ford Motor Company, believed that the “international Jew” had no real statehood and took part in funding wars to profit from them while destroying non-Jewish countries, saying in 1925, “That is what I oppose — a power that has no country and that can order the young men of all countries out to death.” Ford was one of the biggest promulgators of the Protocols, publishing them in his newspaper, the Dearborn Independent, in 1920. (He apologized for doing so seven years later.) American anti-Semitism is based on conspiracy theories that fit the moment As I mentioned above, the conspiracy theory that is anti-Semitism as practiced by the white supremacist far right — the world in which the Pittsburgh shooter was deeply immersed — is racist. Both during the civil rights movement and today, anti-Semites believed that Jewish people controlled nonwhite people and their actions, making them truly “responsible” for what anti-Semitic racists viewed as an effort to encourage miscegenation — “race mixing.” Take the Christian Anti-Jewish Party, founded by J.B. Stoner, a former member of the Ku Klux Klan, in 1945. In its literature, the CAJP held that Jewish people were “behind race mixing,” arguing that Jews were secretly the driving force behind desegregation efforts led by the NAACP. “A Jew, Julius Rosenwald, spent $30 million financing organizations and writers that promote mongrelization. A race once mongrelized is mongrelized forever.” Another racist organization of the 1950s, the National Anti-Jewish Party, argued in its own leaflets that “through inter-mixture of the races the Jews hope to lower the white race to a servile status so as to realize the longed worked for dream of Jewish world domination.” These words were echoed by George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. In April 1966, Rockwell was interviewed by Playboy, and he said that Jews were behind desegregation, arguing that Jews “won’t be mingling like the rest of us. They believe they’re too pure to mix; they think they’re ‘the chosen people’ — chosen to rule the world. But the only world they could rule would be a world of inferior beings. And as long as the white man is pure, they cannot succeed. But when the white man permits himself to be mixed with black men, then the Jews can master him.” On Gab and elsewhere online, from older forums like Stormfront to newer ones like 4chan’s /pol/ board, that language still resonates. Anti-Semites argue that Jews are “using” nonwhite people — like Muslims, or people in the migrant caravan, or even mixed-race couples — to subvert white Americans. On the subject of Muslim immigration, the Pittsburgh shooter shared a posting several weeks ago reading, “Open you Eyes! It’s the filthy EVIL jews Bringing the Filthy EVIL Muslims into the Country!! Stop the kikes then Worry About the Muslims!” To that end, in the mind of anti-Semites who believe that Jewish people are engaged in, as one of the Pittsburgh gunman’s Gab postings put it, a “war against #WhitePeople,” then, taking action against Jewish people through violent means — like killing people in a synagogue — is a defense mechanism. Ironic anti-Semitism is still anti-Semitism But anti-Semitic attitudes that argue Jewish people are secretly in charge of everything haven’t been left to what some might call “serious” anti-Semites — hardened neo-Nazis and white nationalists like the Pittsburgh shooter. In a 2016 interview, far-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos argued that anti-Semitism being voiced by younger people was intended to be “ironic”, saying that the alt-right’s focus on Jews and jokes about “annuda Shoah” — the Shoah is the Holocaust — were intended only to “trigger the libs.” He said, “It’s not because there’s a spontaneous outpouring of anti-Semitism from 22-year-olds in this country. What it is is it’s a mischievous, dissident, trolly generation who do it because it gets a reaction.” But Yiannopoulos then added that while the alt-right might not “care” about Jews, “they may have some prejudice about Jews. Like, ‘The Jews run everything.’ Well, we do. ‘The Jews run all the banks.’ Well, we do. ‘The Jews run the media.’ Well, we do. You know they’re right about all that stuff.” In Milo’s view, the conspiracy theory isn’t a conspiracy theory, because it’s accurate. (It isn’t.) During the 2016 election, Donald Trump gave tacit credence to the memeing “ironic” anti-Semites and their harder-core brethren, both of which sent journalists and others thousands of anti-Semitic tweets and emails and death threats. In 2016, when Trump was asked about anti-Semitic death threats aimed at a writer who had profiled his wife, Melania, Trump responded, “I don’t have a message to the fans” — which neo-Nazis took as an “endorsement.” But whether it be “ironic” anti-Semitism that assumes that jokes about the Holocaust or the death of Jews are humorous because they are offensive, or the violence we witnessed in Pittsburgh believed to be caused by a gunman who wrongly believed Jews were responsible for demographic changes that put him at some sort of risk, these forms of anti-Semitism have mixed and blended online to create an amorphous mass of hate.

Proponents of tighter gun laws, including many survivors of the shooting itself, have begun campaigns to pressure lawmakers and cut support for the National Rifle Association. President Trump, meanwhile, has proposed arming teachers and training them to confront would-be school shooters. To get some perspective on the debate, we turned to those who have been directly affected by gun violence. Our panel included: Austin Eubanks, a survivor of the Columbine school shooting Nicole Hockley, mother of Dylan who killed in the Newtown school shooting, co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise Andy Parker, father of slain journalist Alison Parker, co-founder of the For Alison Foundation Michele Gay, mother of Josephine who was killed in the Newtown school shooting, co-founder of Safe and Sound Schools John Mina, Orlando police chief during the Pulse nightclub shooting, member of the International Association of Chiefs of Police The following is a transcript of the interview with the panel that aired Sunday, Feb. 25, 2018, on ""Face the Nation."" MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to turn now to a group of people whose lives have been impacted directly by gun violence and who have been moved to do something about it. Austin Eubanks was a 17-year-old student at Columbine High School when two of his classmates opened fire in 1999 wounding him and killing 13. He is now the Chief Operating Officer at Foundry Treatment Center and addiction recovery facility out in Colorado. Nicole Hockley's son Dylan was among the 20 children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December of 2012. She co-founded Sandy Hook Promise a group working to protect children from gun violence. Andy Parker's daughter Alison was a reporter for CBS affiliate WDBJ in Roanoke, Virginia when she was shot and killed during a live broadcast in 2015. And he's now an activist and he helped start For Alison an educational foundation named after his daughter. And Michele Gay lost her daughter Josephine in the Sandy Hook massacre. A former teacher she co-founded Safe and Sound Schools following her daughter's death. And joining us now is John Mina from Orlando. He is the chief of police for the Orlando Police Department a job he held back in June 2016 when a gunman entered Pulse Nightclub and killed 49 people. Nicole, I want to start with you. After Sandy Hook people said this has to be different. This was an attack on children. People now are saying that about Parkland. It feels different politically, do you think it is? NICOLE HOCKLEY: I do- I do feel the difference because I think there's a difference between adults advocating for their children versus children advocating for themselves. And these are articulate teenagers sharing their experience and demanding that the adults listen to them. So I think the politicians need to stop their nonsense fighting and instead just kind of shut up and listen a little bit to these kids and listen to what they're demanding because this can't continue we can't keep letting our kids die and feel unsafe in their schools. MARGARET BRENNAN: And you met with a number of these activists in Florida. NICOLE HOCKLEY: I did meet with some of them and their energy and their drive, that energized me because you know I've been in this fight for five years they're at the start of a very long journey. But they have tools in terms of social media and stuff that I didn't really have at my fingertips. They are organizing and mobilizing at an incredibly rapid rate and and they're not listening to what other people are telling them to say they're speaking for themselves. They're being authentic. And I think that has power. MARGARET BRENNAN: Michele do you see that student activism in the same way? MICHELE GAY: I do. And interestingly enough in- in the school safety space when we founded Safe and Sound Schools in the spring following the tragedy, the first and probably most powerful group that we were hearing from was- was students. So we've been working with students now for five years. We just released a youth council program that came out this fall. So we're grateful that a lot of those councils were already established prior to this tragedy and that the kids have this platform to speak in their communities. But I would agree with Nicole. It is- it is different this time because because they are organized because they are speaking up and we want to hear what they have to say. MARGARET BRENNAN: Andy, after your daughter's death you became politically active so did Alison's fiance. Where do you think that this activism should be focused. Is it at the local and state level or is it here in Washington? ANDY PARKER: Margaret, it has to be all of the above. And we have to give law enforcement the tools that they need to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening. And one of them, ironically Marco Rubio brought it up in the town hall last week, is a gun violence restraining order. And you know what a lot of people don't know is that with all the- the alarms and the red flags and the warnings about this shooter in Florida he was never- he was never arrested for anything. So legally law enforcement can't go in and remove weapons. And what the G.V.R.O. or the gun violence restraining order they can. I hope that this changes the equation because Barbara and I testified in front of a Virginia senate committee on this very issue. The chairman of the committee looked at me and said, ""We're sorry for your loss."" And then they voted it down on party lines. Same thing with a- a young woman who survived the Las Vegas shooting was in tears saying, ""Please ban bump stocks."" They did the same thing to her. So you know at this point the Republican Party hopefully there will be a change there but they're the party of the NRA. I mean that's just the fact. MARGARET BRENNAN: Austin, what you lived through happened in the middle of an assault weapons ban, despite it. So when you hear these activists these student activists in particular call for a ban on specifically that, does that speak to you in any way? Do you say that's misguided or how do you think this should be focused? AUSTIN EUBANKS: Well it definitely speaks to me and I'm really inspired by the level of activism that I've seen. The problem that I have is I think that we get so laser focused on either one of two sides it's either gun control or mental health and then nothing ever gets done. So I think that we do have a problem with accessibility to these weapons but specifically I think we have a problem to accessibility to high capacity magazines. We have to bring down the number of shots that somebody can fire before reloading and I think that's exceptionally important. Beyond that we have to look at why this issue is occurring and we have to go all the way back to the way that we're educating and socializing young men. And so what I really advocate for is appointing a non-partisan group of experts who can study this issue comprehensively and in the near term we have to bring down the loss of life. And by doing that we can eliminate high capacity magazines and assault weapons MARGARET BRENNAN: At the federal or local level? AUSTIN EUBANKS: I believe at the federal level. MARGARET BRENNAN: You do. Chief Mina not want to come to you. Quickly before we go to commercial break and then continue our conversation on the other side of it, but Chief it sounds like there were just so many red flags at least 23 calls to local authorities. Flags raised to the FBI in this case and Parkland. How hard is it to actually intervene as law enforcement. I mean is this a matter of just local bureaucracy run amok or is it a failure a dereliction of duty. How do people understand this? CHIEF JOHN MINA: Well it is definitely a failure of all the systems involved. You know at the Orlando Police Department I know many of our law enforcement agencies in central Florida across the nation. There are protocols in place for when we receive social media threats for when we get some of these red flags. And I would tell you that you know we don't stop working until that threat is mitigated until we it you identify the person who made that threat. Go talk to them talk to their parents and go really hands on with them. And in many cases either arrest or commit that person for an involuntary mental examination the issue and some of the problems with that is even if we commit someone under the Baker Act for a mental evaluation they can get their evaluation and probably be released in less than 72 hours and still go in and able to buy a firearm so that- that loophole needs to be closed because many of our law enforcement throughout the country have had many success stories as far as mitigating some of these threats and seeing the red flags and working until the very end putting the person in custody or getting them evaluated and then-- and then that person is still being able to purchase a firearm. MARGARET BRENNAN: Chief, we want to talk to you again on the other side of this break along with the rest of our panel so stay with us please. We'll be back in just a moment. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our panel on gun violence I want to go to Orlando and bring in Chief Mina who was chief in that city during the Pulse Nightclub attack which did involve the shooter using a semi automatic weapon. Chief, I want to ask you this proposal to at the state level have skilled teachers be armed to you. Does that make a difference? CHIEF JOHN MINA: Oh I don't think that's a good idea. Our teachers are already have many responsibilities. It's their job to educate our students and they do a great job of that. Our teachers aren't trained physically or mentally prepared to handle firearms in a stressful situation. Law enforcement throughout the country not only did they get through, you know, hours and months and weeks of training, but they also carry firearms every day and deal and use their firearms. And sometimes in stressful situations and for a teacher to be educating students at one second and then be responsible for responding in a high stress situation with a firearm with not enough training or mental preparation. I don't think it's a good fit. I'm definitely against that. MARGARET BRENNAN: Michele you are a former-former teacher. What do you think about arming educators? MICHELE GAY:I would agree completely. I- I just I understand that it's a community based decision and that will always be our position that Safe and Sound Schools. We know that different communities are made up of different people with different backgrounds and there are different circumstances. Some of our school communities are facing you know response times that that may be up to 50 minutes so I understand the need to look at all solutions put them all on the table. But when I think very practically about myself sitting in a second grade classroom on the floor criss cross applesauce with- with my students teaching reading. The last thing I would be ready for in the split second that it might happen is is having to pull out a firearm and pull it from my hip and intervene in that way and further having worked with School Resource Officers so closely for the past five years, we know the level of training that they undergo. We know the time the mindset as the other guest is talking about just just the familiarity of having that firearm with you and all of that working consideration that goes into that. That's not something I want to put on a teacher who is already very overburdened sadly with a lot of tremendous responsibilities. MARGARET BRENNAN: Austin, Colorado has explored this. What do you think? AUSTIN EUBANKS: So I'm opposed to it as well but I do believe that we have to strengthen schools by way of architecture, metal detectors or perhaps additional security personnel. But I do think that those two functions have to be completely separate. Educators have to focus on education and security officials need to focus on security. MARGARET BRENNAN: Nicole, with Sandy Hook Promise you've been looking at ways to harden the response, at least. What are you looking at proposing? NICOLE HOCKLEY: Well I agree that we need to focus on how do we handle imminent danger such as school security and the infrastructure of our schools. But I do believe that the shift needs to focus more to prevention. How do we help identify people that are at risk of potentially hurting themselves or others. That's what we offer from Sandy Hook Promise and about seven thousand schools at the moment with our free programs and our free anonymous reporting system. This is a way for teachers, educators, students and parents to say this is what I'm recognizing and this is what I'm seeing and then have a system to report it and to be honest in terms of arming teachers it would be better to arm them with this knowledge and the ability to do that to prevent violence before it happens and if there's federal funding available for these programs versus arming teachers, I would put it towards the programs or you know giving teachers more what they need in terms of supplies or books or arming them with more school counselors as well to help these kids. MARGARET BRENNAN: Andy, I'm going to ask you you personally faced some backlash for your activism and something we're seeing now with these students in Florida. Where does that come from? ANDY PARKER: There are a legion of hoaxers that descend on they descended on me like locusts. They've done the same thing with the kids in Florida. They call it crisis actors. They say Alison is-- has had plastic surgery and is living in Israel someplace. You know, the level of cruelty is just unimaginable. But you know it's fuelled if you do all you have to do is look up the street on Pennsylvania Avenue. It's enabled by a president that has unhinged tweets every single day. Arming teachers and so he's enabling this kind-- he's helping create the sort of atmosphere that that brings upon these people. MARGARET BRENNAN: What did you think of the president's listening session this week? You were there in the choir. ANDY PARKER: It was. It was pathetic, frankly. And then when he comes out with again this this this crazy notion of arming teachers. Teachers are going to quit before they carry a firearm in class. It was-- when you have to hold a note card that says I hear you. I mean come on. That's unimpressive to say the least. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well talking points are something many walk into a room with to get through that, but I appreciate your passion all of you for coming here to share your personal stories. Thank you. We want all of you to come to Washington today for this conversation. We really appreciate all of you being here and all of you watching, we'll be back.",Margaret Brennan Face the Nation  CBS Evening News CBS News Austin Eubanks CBSN Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting  News,"Catherine, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, and her father, Andy, a former teacher, at a memorial for the victims of the shooting in Parkland, Fla., in December.","The debate over gun control and how to stop school shootings ramped into high gear this week, days after the shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead.

Dan Patrick blamed Friday's massacre at a high school near Houston in part on ""too many entrances and too many exits"" on the campus, prompting some to mock his perspective as ""door control."" ""From what we know, this student walked in ... with a long coat and a shotgun under his coat,"" said Patrick, a Republican who has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association . ""It's 90 degrees. Had there been one single entrance possibly for every student, maybe he would have been stopped."" Patrick, who has previously pushed for open carry and concealed carry laws in Texas, made the comments during a news conference on the same day a 17-year-old student allegedly opened fire with a shotgun and a revolver at Santa Fe High School, killing 10 people and injuring at least 10 others. The firearms were owned by the suspect's father, Texas' governor has said. While Patrick also implored parents who own guns to lock them safely away, he focused his remarks not on weapons but on redesigning school entryways. In placing a focus on doors, Patrick seemingly fell in line with the powerful gun-lobbying group's strategy following school-shooting incidents of identifying possible ways -- apart from restricting firearms -- to make campuses safer. ""There are too many entrances and too many exits to our over 8,000 campuses in Texas. There aren't enough people to put a guard in every entrance and exit,"" Patrick said, suggesting officials consider retrofitting existing schools to reduce doorways. Patrick's proposal drew criticism online, with some noting that it ignored the role of guns in the recent bloodshed.

Guns don't kill people. Doors kill people (by making it harder to flee shooters). https://t.co/JcyRW2O72c — Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) May 18, 2018 Also, in the event of a school shooting, not sure if creating a situation where people can't try to get out through the other doors is a great idea. — Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) May 18, 2018 Robert Solomon, the division director for building and life safety codes with the National Fire Protection Association , said the issue may not be the number of entrances and exits but the availability of access points. Many buildings now are designed with a single entry point but many more optional exits. Think of Walmart or Costco, he said, with one main entrance and exit doors around the perimeter that can open from the inside in case of emergency. ""Maybe his goal was to limit the number of access points, to funnel everyone through a single entrance point,"" Solomon said of Patrick's comments. ""That is perfectly acceptable as long as I have all these other doors for people that are already inside that need to get out in an emergency,"" he said. ""That is a very typical arrangement, and it still would be code-compliant."" In his comments, Patrick compared schools to other major facilities. ""If we can protect a large office building or a courthouse or any major facility, maybe we need to look at limiting the entrance and the exits into our schools so that we can have law enforcement looking at the people who come in one or two entrances,"" he said. Patrick also suggested staggering student start times to avoid a logjam at the door. ""Now, that will take a lot of work and a lot of money, but we need to do the work and do the money to protect the children the best we can. In other words, we may need to harden our schools and make them safer,"" he said.

Audience members watch with rapt attention as the cast of Spring Awakening reappears from backstage, now dressed in modern activist T-shirts. “All shall know the song of purple summer,” choruses the cast, receiving a standing ovation. Me + You Productions’ “Spring Awakening,” a musical adaptation of the 1891 play “Spring Awakening” by Frank Wedekind, tells the tale of adolescents in 1890s Germany, revealing the consequences of growing up in a repressive and ultra-conservative society that forbids all sexual conduct. The original 2006 Broadway production won eight Tonys, one of which was “Best Musical.” Sitting in the middle seat of the front row on opening night, I was extremely impressed by Me + You Productions’ socio-political spin on “Spring Awakening.” The level of intimacy with the audience caused goosebumps to appear on my arms when Andrew Gleckler, starring as Melchior Gabor, chose to sing his first song, “All That’s Known,” while making direct eye contact with everyone in the first row. Furthermore, the amount of sophistication displayed by the cast never ceased to astound me, considering that the only furniture they had to work with were chairs. The aspect that I respected the most, however, was the play’s overarching push for gun control. Signs with quotes from victims, statistics on recent shootings, and more were utilized to create the stage’s background, and Me + You Productions plans to donate 100 percent of ticket proceeds from this production to Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization who aims to reduce gun deaths in the wake of increased mass shootings. As a teenager growing up in a time period where school shootings seem inevitable, I cannot help but be frightened when I realize how desensitized my community is to violence. Because of social media’s tendency to over-dramatize and the increased occurrence of shootings, teenagers are often either too aware or completely ignorant of the dangers they face. Attending the play gave me great relief to know that there are adults actively advocating for gun control. “Spring Awakening” delves deeply and poignantly into the issues that our society faces today,” said Asha Noel lyer, Me + You Productions Founder and “Spring Awakening” Producer. “I wanted to tangibly affect the world, and I chose to do this play because I couldn’t get over the parallels. We live in a world that doesn’t protect its youth, and that is directly what the show is about.” Me + You Productions is set to close out their three-week running of “Spring Awakening” this weekend at The Lounge Theatre in West Hollywood.

Numbers like that were likely on the mind of one woman on Facebook when she posted a photo of novelty holiday lights for sale at Walmart made of used shotgun shells. In the wake of the shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., on Wednesday night, this kind of decoration appeared insensitive. Many on social media commented on the post, which was shared by multiple other accounts. Some, though, believed Cruz was overreacting to a decoration that’s been around for many years and is intended to celebrate hunting. “They might be really tacky but they have absolutely nothing to do with the gun violence of 2018,” wrote @trinity_rymel on Instagram. “A lot of people hunt and since the Holidays are during the same time as hunting season it’s a very good sales tactic. Y’all are getting really mad for all the wrong reasons. Yeah it’s super redneck if you actually put these lights up but it’s not deplorable by any means. And Walmart isn’t the only place that sells these. There are a lot bigger problems than some fake $4.99 Christmas lights.” While Walmart and other retailers sell this kind of novelty item, many enjoy making ornaments and other decorations with used shotgun casings. Pinterest and crafting sites are packed with suggestions of how to reuse the plastic and metal cylinders. It’s a confluence of a DIY, zero-waste lifestyle with gun culture that can’t be summed up and easily reacted to on social media. Still, considering the prevalence of gun violence in this country, it’s hard now to separate the objects from their violent symbolism, particularly in contrast to the peaceful messages of the Christmas season. “I just think that there has to be a different way to remember or commemorate grandpas, dads and other family members who were/are hunters,” wrote @nancysavage6788. “If nothing else how about they stay unlit this year in memory of the many that were lost in a horrific year of violence. Not that any year is more or less violent then any other year but it would be one very small gesture. Just think about it.” Story continues There’s one more sinister reading of these items, as pointed out by another comment on Instagram: Using shotgun shells as Christmas decorations may be a reference to a twisted version of “Jingle Bells” that referred to killing African-Americans during the Civil Rights movement. Regardless of their original intent, that association might make buyers think twice about these lights.

Here's what we know,"Two people were fatally shot and another 11 were injured after a 24-year-old man opened fire on a high-stakes esports tournament at a Florida mall Sunday. The suspect, a Baltimore resident who was in Jacksonville, Florida, for the “Madden NFL 19” video game tournament, killed himself after attacking a room full of competitors. Authorities have yet to determine a motive for the shooting, but did say that the suspect “clearly targeted other gamers.” Here’s what we know so far about the attack. What happened The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office initially said on its official Twitter account that police were responding to a mass shooting at The Jacksonville Landing, a riverfront strip of restaurants, bars and shops that runs along the St. Johns River. The office gave an all-caps warning to “STAY AWAY” from the area. Later, the office confirmed that shooting took place at the gaming event, adding that the first 911 call came in at 1:34 p.m. local time. Another followed two minutes later. #TheLandingMassShooting – Shooting occurred at a Madden (19) Tournament at Chicago Pizza at The Jacksonville Landing.

Police have yet to confirm how many times the suspect fired, but 12 shots could be heard in the video. Hours later, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams told reporters that a suspect, identified as a white male, was dead at the scene. The victims Authorities said three people died in the shooting, including the suspect, who turned the gun on himself after opening fire. Of the 11 additional people injured in the attack, 10 were wounded by gunfire. The other was treated for a non-gunfire injury. Police have yet to officially identify all the victims, but several survivors spoke up on social media following the shooting. A gamer, known as “DUBBY” on Twitter, said that a bullet “grazed my head.” “I feel fine, just a scratch on my head. Traumatized and devastated,” the gamer added>.

The suspect Police identified David Katz, 24, of Baltimore to be the gunman. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams told reporters in a briefing Monday that Katz carried two handguns and extra ammunition into the building. The sheriff said investigators believe he only fired one handgun during the attack. The weapons appeared to have been recently and legally purchased. “We have yet to have a concrete motive,” he said, adding that no notes from the suspect have been found.

She should have been at home grieving her classmates, she said, ""but instead we are up here standing together because if all our government and president can do is send thoughts and prayers, then it's time for victims to be the change that we need to see."" A 19-year-old gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Wednesday, killing 14 students and three staff members, and injuring 14 others. The suspect was arrested and charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder. In the wake of the third mass shooting to take place in a US school in the first two months of 2018, Marjory Stoneman Douglas students such as Gonzalez are calling for stricter gun control measures to prevent other students from living through the same tragedy. ""Politicians who sit in their gilded House and Senate seats funded by the NRA telling us nothing could have been done to prevent this, we call B.S.,"" Gonzalez said at the rally on Saturday. ""They say tougher guns laws do not decrease gun violence. We call B.S.... They say no laws could have prevented the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred. We call B.S."" ""They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence. We call BS!"" Florida high school shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez calls on President Trump and lawmakers to tighten gun restrictions in impassioned speech at an anti-gun rally in Fort Lauderdale https://t.co/DgnqrrVs9x — CNN (@CNN) February 17, 2018 Other Marjory Stoneman Douglas students called BS on pro-gun advocates' Twitter arguments that the issue ""isn't about a gun it's about another lunatic."" And dozens of students from another Florida high school held a rally to call for gun reform, telling Refinery29: ""Our message is simple: We want to stop the gun violence."" But increased gun control in Florida won't come easily. Despite Florida Governor Rick Scott telling CNN ""everything's on the table "" when it comes to gun reform in the state, he wouldn't explicitly say he supports stricter gun control laws. Scott has an A+ rating from the National Rifle Association's (NRA) Political Victory Fund, which stated in 2014 that he's ""signed more pro-gun bills into law in one term than any other governor in Florida history."" It's not just Scott who has the NRA's support, either; congressional and presidential candidates from Florida received a total of $834,165 from the NRA’s Political Victory Fund in the 2016 election, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Currently, 18-year-olds can buy AR-15 rifles — originally designed for military use — without a waiting period in the state, while anyone seeking to buy a handgun must wait three days. Like most states, Florida also has “Stand Your Ground” laws that allow people to use deadly force to defend themselves against a perceived threat, as well as laws permitting people to carry concealed guns in public. I was hiding in a closet for 2 hours. It was about guns. You weren't there, you don't know how it felt. Guns give these disgusting people the ability to kill other human beings. This IS about guns and this is about all the people who had their life abruptly ended because of guns. https://t.co/XnzhvuN1zd — carly (@car_nove) February 15, 2018 Florida's pro-gun laws have strong public support, too. As The New York Times' Richard A. Oppel Jr. reports: ""Nearly two million residents have permits to carry concealed weapons, far more than any other state."" Florida is less an anomaly than an apt representation of the problems activists fighting for gun control face nationwide. After a mass shooting at Orlando's Pulse nightclub in 2016 that killed 49 people and another at the Fort Lauderdale airport in 2017 that killed five, no substantial gun reform laws were passed. The same inaction has been seen in Congress: Lawmakers failed to pass restrictions on bump stocks (which outfit semi-automatic rifles to fire more like automatic rifles) after 58 people were fatally shot in Las Vegas. Gonzalez, many of her classmates, and other gun control activists believe enough is enough. On March 14, students and teachers will stage a national school walkout organised by the Women's March to demand Congress take action. And on March 24, activists will take to the streets in Washington D.C. in a March For Our Lives rally demanding the same. Establishing stricter gun control measures in the US certainly won't be easy, but activists think it's about time students stop dying in their classrooms. Like what you see?

1234,90485,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/how-seattle-nun-led-shareholder-revolt-against-gun-makers-n915006,How a Seattle nun led a shareholder revolt against gun makers,"Sister Judy Byron doesn’t have a degree in finance and, having taken a vow of poverty, doesn’t have much personal use for the stock market. And yet the Seattle nun is a leader of Wall Street rebels. Byron, a member of the Adrian Dominican Sisters, helps faith-based activist investors push large, publicly traded companies to consider their social impact. She researches corporations, develops strategies to persuade them to make changes and recruits like-minded investors to join her. Then she uses that leverage to write to the company or file a shareholder resolution. “When I say that I’ve always been interested in social justice, it isn’t just to know about it and be aware of it, but to bring about change and bring about justice,” Byron said. “We’re looking to change the system.” Their target this year has been America’s gun makers, with some unexpected results. Driven by outrage over the Feb. 14 massacre at a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and backed by some of the country’s largest institutional investors, Byron and a small band of shareholders have forced two firearm manufacturers to produce reports detailing how their guns are used in violent crimes and what the companies are doing to develop safer weapons. The manufacturers did not want to do this, and urged their shareholders to reject the proposals. But both times, first with Sturm Ruger in May and on Tuesday with American Outdoor Brands, a majority sided with the activists. The Ruger booth at the 2016 National Shooting Sports Foundation's Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show in Las Vegas. Ethan Miller / Getty Images file Those surprising victories may turn the financial market into a new front in the battle over solutions to gun violence. “Her organization has hit on issues that are relevant not only culturally and socially but also relevant to shareholders,” said Courteney Keatinge, director of environmental, social and governance research at Glass Lewis, a proxy adviser that recommended clients vote for the activists’ proposals. That includes an eye for vulnerabilities to “reputational risk” — changes in the way a company is perceived that can cause its value to suffer. “It’s pretty novel and pretty impressive,” Keatinge said. The votes have also made Byron a luminary among her fellow crusaders, who describe her as a quiet leader: methodical and persistent in her activism but also restrained and compassionate when it comes to dealing with the executives whose minds she hopes to change. “She’ll walk out of a meeting and say to me, ‘I don’t think the CEO looked very good today, how do you think she’s doing?’” said Margaret Weber, the corporate responsibility director for the Congregation of St. Basil, a Toronto-based order of Catholic priests, who has known Byron for 20 years and has watched her negotiate with corporate executives. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha Weber added: “She’s not very complicated. She’s just genuine. Strong and solid.” A CALLING TO ACTIVISM Byron admits she’s no stock market guru. Raised in a small lumber town on the Washington coast, she became a nun after graduating high school in 1960, then taught and served as a principal at Catholic schools. She says that as a student and an educator she felt compelled to find tangible ways to improve people’s lives. “My religion wasn’t just about God and me; my religion called me to be concerned about others, and to work for the common good,” Byron said. That led her, in 1998, to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, an organization of institutional investors that was formed in the early 1970s to end economic support of the apartheid-based regime in South Africa and has since embraced an array of social and environmental causes. Byron also became director of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, made up of religious communities looking for profitable, and influential, ways to manage their retirement funds and other assets. She learned on the job, with help from members of her coalition who had more experience in financial markets: “socially responsible” asset managers, nonprofits, labor unions. “You really can’t do this work on your own,” Byron said. Through the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, “we have any number of people I can call or email for guidance and have an answer in a few minutes. Our strength is in our partnerships.” ‘WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING’ Byron said she believes their successes this year with firearm companies represent a first step in a process to persuade companies to take a more active role in reducing violence. “We have our toe in the door, but this is going to be a long journey,” Byron said. The effort began two years ago, when Byron floated the idea in a meeting of the Adrian Dominican Sisters’ portfolio advisory board, a group of nuns and lay people who set criteria for the congregation’s investment strategies. “The phenomenon of mass shootings, children dying, people dying because of gun violence, she wasn’t just doing this because of an ideology, but because she was feeling the pain,” Weber, who was at the meeting, recalled. “Judy took the initiative by saying, ‘We need to do something.’” Byron persuaded the Adrian Dominicans to buy gun stocks, and organized other members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility to join her, pooling their holdings in three companies: Dick’s Sporting Goods, a retailer, and two manufacturers, Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, which owns the Smith & Wesson brand. Byron and her fellow activists then wrote to the companies with requests to meet their executives in person. Dick’s was the only to respond, saying it was exploring changes to its firearm policies. THE PARKLAND EFFECT Then came the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland. The public outcry and student activism sparked a new wave of calls for gun control ─ and new pressure on gun retailers and gun makers. Suddenly, Byron and her fellow activists had big institutional investors on their side, including BlackRock, which owned large chunks of shares and endorsed the proposals. That gave them the votes to pass the measures at Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands. In both cases, the companies’ chief executives were defiant, saying the activists couldn’t force them to change their operations. In fact, the companies aren’t required to follow the resolutions. But analysts expect them to comply rather than risk shareholders’ anger. Byron delivered a brief statement to American Outdoor Brands during Tuesday’s online meeting, saying that the company’s weapons were used in the Parkland attack and prior mass shootings. She appealed to the company’s responsibility not only to produce profitable returns for investors but also “to seek to prevent or mitigate human rights impacts that are directly, or indirectly, linked to their products.” Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands did not respond to requests for comment on Byron and the activists. But after Tuesday’s vote, American Outdoor Brands CEO James Debney said the process had become hijacked by a “political agenda.” Such a characterization of Byron isn’t accurate, said Patty Bowman, the executive director at the Intercommunity Peace and Justice Center in Seattle, a social-justice nonprofit that includes Byron’s Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment. “The American Outdoor Brands people said this is partisan and political. But she’s not that way. She’s reasoned and responsible and committed,” Bowman said. “It’s long, slow work, this shareholder activism work.

Kavanaugh walked away from the father of Jaime Guttenberg, who was among 17 people murdered in the Valentine's Day rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The encounter sparked a range of responses from Twitter users, with many suggesting that it was a visual representation of where conservatives stand on gun control reform. But on Friday, the issue of gun violence was upon Kavanaugh again when the Senate Judiciary Committee heard an emotional testimony from Stoneman Douglas survivor Aalayah Eastmond. Kavanaugh has defended his dissent in a case related to a ban on semi-automatic rifles—the weapon of choice in the Parkland slayings. Still, the judge, whose two daughters joined him (for a time) at the hearings, says he knows the U.S. must address gun violence. Not convinced: Eastmond, who spoke at the March For Our Lives rally and became a youth advocate with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and student-led Team ENOUGH. Eastmond was appalled by the judge’s refusal to engage with Jaime’s dad at the hearing: “The amount of disrespect is unimaginable, and this is who, ‘so-called President’ nominated,” tweeted the Parkland senior. “See you Friday Kavanaugh.” At the hearing, she used the horror she had seen at her own school (she hid under the body of a dead classmate to survive the shooting), and also the loss of an uncle to a shooting in Brooklyn, New York, to raise questions about Kavanaugh's views on gun control: ""As you make your final decision, think about it as if you had to justify and defend your choice to those who we lost to gun violence,"" she urged the committee in her prepared remarks. Story continues On the eve of her Senate testimony, Eastmond talked to Glamour about her decision to speak against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Here are the highlights, in her own words. I'm here to testify at Kavanaugh's hearing [so] people can understand that gun violence is an everyday problem… Lives are being taken every day. And not only that, but lives in urban communities, every day. I was there on February 14th. And I was in Room 1214, which was the third classroom the shooter shot into, and I had to hide underneath one of my deceased classmate's bodies to survive. That is the story that I'm sharing [so] people can understand that it's not, you know, normal. And it shouldn't be normalized. I saw things that nobody should have seen and that nobody should have to see in their lifetime. Being in school, [a] place where you should feel safe and you're learning—in fact, I was in Holocaust History [class], learning about hate and terror. And just to experience that right after going over [a] hate groups project was just unimaginable, and a coincidence. Hearing gunshots and not knowing what gunshots sound like. Not knowing what to do and then just thinking in a survival-mode type of way to do what I did, which was hide underneath a body. Smelling the gunpowder and seeing the smoke, and seeing the red on the floor and having flesh and body matter in my hair. At the age of 17 in school — [well] I was 16 at the time — that shouldn't be. I shouldn't have to be talking about this, and I'm not the only one that has this story. There's people all over the country that share similar stories. It's something that nobody wants to talk about — and it's something that I am forced to talk about every day. [It’s] not only just what I experienced, but the fact that black and brown youth are disproportionately impacted by gun violence every day. I don't think [Kavanaugh] should be [a] Supreme Court judge. Period. [If] we're gonna have a judge on the highest court of the land, they need to be a judge that recognizes the issue of gun violence and the epidemic that the youth is experiencing every day, and he doesn't recognize that it's a problem, so I don't think he should be getting that seat. [Based on] his comments towards the Second Amendment, he doesn't believe it should be altered or changed at all because it's ""a well-regulated militia"" and everybody deserves the right to own a gun. But I disagree, because your freedom to own a gun is not more important than my freedom to live. If he doesn't have the decency to shake a hand of a father of a victim, he definitely will not have the decency to make changes and decisions that will impact the lives of people every day… I honestly just think we need a different nominee. I think we've seen enough of Kavanaugh, and I don't think we should wait any longer for him to say anything else, because we clearly know what his stance is on the Second Amendment and other things as well. I'm sure Fred Guttenberg [father of Parkland student Jaime Guttenberg] would have loved to bring his daughter. Fred had a daughter, too, that lost her life on February 14. And I don't appreciate Kavanaugh not addressing that. I feel like he will [not] recognize that it's an issue until he loses one of his kids, or until he loses a family member, so he understands the pain and the way that it impacts you and that it's senseless. So that's how I look at it: [Kavanaugh] can bring his kids wherever, but don't wait until your kids are gone for you to care. I have faith that he will not [be confirmed]. I hope he doesn't, but I can't tell the future. All I know is that we're [going] to share our stories and our views and opinions on him, and hopefully they hear us out and they take action. At times, it's frustrating, because I shouldn't have this story and I shouldn't have had to experienced that. But it is important that I share my story, so people can again get a different perspective and understand that it is an issue that impacts everybody — no matter the color of their skin or where they live. It is a problem in America, and it needs to be fixed. Right now, I'm okay, because I have my fellow Team ENOUGH members supporting me here. So I'm not worried, and I know that we are stronger than Kavanaugh and any of his views, and I know that we can take him down, no matter what. You can watch Eastmond's full testimony, here.

241,10125,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-feinstein-gun-control-20180328-story.html,Gun violence has defined Sen. Dianne Feinstein's career. The issue is more important than ever for her now,"Dianne Feinstein was settling into her office at San Francisco City Hall after a two-week vacation in the Himalayas. A former colleague passed by but didn’t respond when she called out. She heard gunshots. And then silence. The year was 1978, and Feinstein was president of the county Board of Supervisors. She was the first person to discover Supervisor Harvey Milk on the floor of his office. “I could smell the gunpowder. Harvey was on his stomach,” Feinstein told The Times in an interview. “I tried to find a pulse; I put my finger in a bullet hole.” A few hours later she became the face of a national tragedy, announcing on a balcony of the City Hall that former supervisor Dan White had killed Milk, one of the nation’s first openly gay elected officials, and Mayor George Moscone. Advertisement “I became mayor as the product of assassination,” Feinstein said. The violent experience shaped her views and career. Now a U.S. senator, she is perhaps best known for her quest over 25 years in Congress to enact stricter national gun control, including authoring the now-expired original assault weapons ban.

(Associaiated Press / AFP / Getty Images / EPA / Los Angeles Times ) “It’s an issue that has framed and really bookended her career,” said Jerry Roberts, a former San Francisco Chronicle editor and author of “Dianne Feinstein: Never Let Them See You Cry.” “It definitely speaks to her perseverance and endurance, which are two of the strongest characteristics she has as a politician that have served her and really enabled her longevity.” Advertisement Gun control is rarely a top issue for California voters but has new relevance this year as Feinstein, 84, seeks reelection. She has directly challenged President Trump to support legislation banning bump stocks and assault-style weapons that enable mass killings such as what happened at a country music festival in Las Vegas last fall and at a high school in Parkland, Fla., this year. And Feinstein has tried to seize on the energy created by students in the aftermath of the tragedy in Florida, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of young people who marched Saturday. She was among the speakers at the protest in San Francisco. “It was an amazing day with the march,” Feinstein told reporters Tuesday after meeting with gun violence survivors and their family members, activists and medical personnel at UCLA Medical Center’s Mattel Children’s Hospital. “I’ve been doing what I do for a substantial period of time and I’ve never seen anything like it.” The focus on gun control comes at an opportune time for Feinstein. In her bid for a fifth full term, she is facing a challenge on her left flank. Her moderation has irked the most liberal members of her party’s base, as seen in her failure to come close to obtaining the California Democratic Party’s endorsement last month. Her rival, fellow Democrat Kevin de León, has championed tighter restrictions on guns and ammunition as a state senator and has touted his record on the issue on the campaign trail. Advertisement De León, who is challenging Feinstein from the left and argues she is too centrist, has little to quibble about with her stance on guns. “This is an area where we have much common ground and much shared accomplishments,” he said. “We complement each other.” Feinstein has seized upon the issue as she asks for support. “I have been a woman on a mission to ban assault weapons,” the senator said, to applause, at a gathering of union members at the California Democratic Party convention this year. She said a pilot had told her earlier that day that his 7-year-old was afraid to go to school. “This is not our America, and we need to change it,” she said. Advertisement Follow California politics by signing up for our email newsletter » This may sound like naked opportunism in the midst of a campaign, but gun control has been the through-line of Feinstein’s political career. Two years before the Milk and Moscone assassinations, the anticapitalist group New World Liberation Front planted a bomb in a flower box outside her daughter’s bedroom window. It failed to explode. The group also shot out windows at her vacation home. In response, Feinstein was trained by police to use a Smith & Wesson .38 five-shot revolver and obtained a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Advertisement “I made the determination that if somebody was going to try to take me out, I was going to take them with me,” Feinstein told the Associated Press in 1993. Feinstein carried the gun in a snapped leather holster in her purse until one day she wondered how quickly she could access it if she needed it. “Two pairs of glasses, a wallet, a notebook, a pen, a pencil, a little cosmetics case — it took me a while to get to it in what was a pretty good-sized purse,” Feinstein said. “I thought, ‘Hmm. This isn’t going to do me much good.’ ” In 1982, she presented Pope John Paul II with a 10-inch-tall gunmetal blue cross at the Vatican that was created from 15 melted-down firearms, including her own, that were turned in during a gun buyback program in San Francisco. Advertisement That same year, Feinstein signed a local gun-control ordinance that banned most residents from owning pistols, leading a different fringe group to try to oust her from the mayorship in a recall. In an uncharacteristic display of emotion, Feinstein told the Chronicle that she “shed a few tears.” “I guess I don’t have as much of a shell around me as some people think. I was hurt by it. I still am,” she said at the time. The ordinance was later invalidated by the courts, but Feinstein retained her job in the recall election. Advertisement The following years were rife with gun violence, including in California. A 1989 school shooting in Stockton led the state to become the first in the nation to ban military-style assault weapons. In 1993, a gunman killed eight people at a San Francisco law firm, leading Feinstein to write the federal assault weapons ban that was signed into law the following year. It was a landmark piece of legislation, though critics argue that provisions included to ease its passage — notably the grandfathering of 1.5 million such weapons already in Americans’ possession and a sunset clause — undermined its effectiveness. Advertisement When Congress allowed the law to expire in 2004, part of the debate centered on its effectiveness. University of Massachusetts researcher Louis Klarevas, the author of “Rampage Nation: Securing America from Mass Shootings,” said his study of a half-century of mass shootings found that their number was rising prior to the ban and declined during the ban, including a five-year period when there was not a single shooting with six or more fatalities. The numbers increased and grew more frequent, he said, after the law’s sunset. Feinstein has attempted to reenact the assault weapons ban, including in the aftermath of the attempted assassination of then-Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in 2011 in Tucson and the mass killing at Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut in 2012. On the wall in Feinstein’s Senate office is a framed copy of the New York Daily News with photos of the slain first-graders and the headline: “Shame on U.S.” Advertisement “I’m looking at the picture right now, 20 beautiful 6- and 7-year-olds, all with a smile,” Feinstein said in the phone interview. “How can we let this go on?” It got even more personal for Feinstein last year when a gunman opened fire at the Route 91 Harvest country music festival in Las Vegas. Her daughter Katherine and some friends were supposed to attend the concert and canceled at the last minute, selling the tickets. One of the people who bought them suffered a graze wound. After the massacre, Feinstein introduce the latest version of her expired assault weapons ban, including the elimination of some of provisions that gun-control advocates argue created loopholes in the original bill. President Trump and Sen. Dianne Feinstein. (Alex Wong / Getty Images ) Advertisement The National Rifle Assn., which didn’t respond to a request for comment, called the proposal a “125-page firearm prohibition fever dream [that] is perhaps the most far-reaching gun ban ever introduced in Congress.” Seeing the teenage activists mobilize thousands and companies restrict their policies toward gun and ammunition sales has led Feinstein to think the moment might have arrived, at long last. But it’s an open question whether President Trump will back her call for legislation solidifying that cultural change. Feinstein said she was cognizant of the president’s record but hopeful that Trump would stay true to the views he expressed during a recent meeting, where she handed him a letter about her experiences and he surprised her by appearing to agree with her views. “I hope he doesn’t waffle on what he said because human life in this country depends on it,” she said.

833,90256,http://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/404954-our-children-are-being-massacred-and-not-by-isis-but-by-guns,"Our children are being massacred — and not by ISIS, but by guns","Recently, at our family dinner, we expressed our shock about the latest mass shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Fla. The surprise owed to the events taking place at a Madden tournament, not a Fortnite tournament. Our blasé reaction — our lack of horror — in the face of the attack was in its own way as horrifying as the shooting itself. It stems from the routine nature of gun violence in this country, as well as a failure to fully grasp the most profound implications of the gun violence epidemic: We are failed parents living in a failed state. ADVERTISEMENT As parents, as citizens and as a society, we have accepted the unacceptable. We have accepted the fact that our children are at risk everyday as if we were in Columbia, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, or Venezuela, the countries that along with the U.S., contribute to half the global deaths attributed to gun violence . Whether we live in an urban, rural, or suburban area, whether our children attend a well-funded or struggling public school, we have accepted the fact that our children may be gunned down at their desks or huddling in a janitorial closet. Our lawmakers have accepted it, as well as those in charge of our national security. Lisa Monaco, former Homeland Security advisor to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaTrump responds to Biden's accusation of racism by comparing himself to Lincoln The Hill's Campaign Report: Biden, Obama reunite for socially distanced conversation Trump campaign leans into Goya controversy in new Spanish ads MORE, gave a talk at Dartmouth College and recalled how in the early days of ISIS, American children had expressed their concern that ISIS militants might come for them, like some bogeyman. Homeland Security exists, she assured us, to calm our children’s fears and to secure them from massacre by the likes of ISIS. Well, here’s news: Our children are being massacred, and not by ISIS. As Monaco relayed, only 92 fatalities on American soil have been attributed to Islamist terrorists since 9/11, as a testimony to our successes on the international counterterrorism front. By contrast, mass shootings claimed the lives of 100 victims in the months from October 2017 (the Las Vegas Shooting) to February 2018 (the Parkland, Fla. school shooting) alone. That begs two questions that are at the forefront of my research as a scholar of Russian studies: what is “national security”? And, what is “terrorism?” To dispel any misconceptions, national security does not refer to the personal security and well being of the citizens of nation, but the security of the state as a sovereign political entity. And that ultimately contentious word “terrorism” refers to violence or threat of violence that poses a political threat to the state. It might be worthwhile to recall where this concept of “terrorism” as a threat posed to the state, rather than to the people who make up the state, originated. In Russia, in the late nineteenth century social revolutionaries seeking to overthrow the autocratic government systematically targeted officials of the state and called themselves “terrorists.” After the revolutionaries succeeded in assassinating Tsar Alexander II in 1881, the Russian government tried to convince Western powers to join a counterterrorist coalition that would specifically combat politically-motivated violence against the state and heads of state. Ordinary people never entered into the equation, although dynamite attacks on high officials in fact inflicted significant collateral damage. “Terrorism” has retained this sense of a “politically motivated threat to the state” even though ordinary people increasingly became its victims. School and mass shootings are not empirically different from attacks that are labelled “terrorist,” such as Omar Mateen’s attack on the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Fla. However, they are framed differently by the news media, politicians, and law enforcement — as politically motivated and therefore existential threats to our polity, even when the motivation for the act is ambiguous. The full force and resources of Homeland Security, as well as our country’s laws on terrorism, are brought to bear in such cases. Individual state legislatures should be commended for moving ahead with finger-in-the-dike legal measures, like bans on bump stocks, universal background checks, restraining orders. But from New Hampshire to Florida, California to Maryland, this is a national crisis that claims more victims on U.S. soil than so-called “terrorist” attacks. It’s time to reframe mass shootings as a national security issue, and not a “mental health” issue, which makes it an anomalous act of a disturbed individual, or a “public health” issue, which obscures the defining attributes of the attack. It’s mass violence and it has an impact on the security of every one of our citizens. What we need is a more robust federal solution that takes cognizance of gun violence as an existential threat to our society akin to terrorism. With a seemingly NRA-funded Trump presidency and a Republican majority in congress, we can forget reconceptualizing gun violence as a threat to our national security for now. But imagine if under revamped Homeland Security laws, all military grade weapons were sold legally only to and for use by the branches of our nation’s military, while recreational guns and handguns for personal security could be purchased by citizens undergoing an extensive background check and a licensing course? Then we could deal with the more complex social and mental health issues that contribute to gun violence but do not “cause” it. The easy availability of powerful firearms does. The foundation of a state’s legitimacy is its ability to secure its population, which is based ultimately on its monopoly on violence and the means of violence. The fact that it finds itself in the company of countries like Mexico, Guatemala, and Venezuela in terms of gun deaths indicates that the United States government has effectively ceded its monopoly on violence under pressure of a powerful lobby for gun manufacturers. No government could afford to cede its monopoly on violence to such a degree to foreign hostiles and claim legitimacy as a government, hence the “threat to our national security” that terrorism poses. Where has my children’s — and my homeland — security gone? For me, the two are inseparable.

Florida’s Stoneman Douglas High School pupils, who formed March for Our Lives in the aftermath of the February shooting that left 17 students and staff dead, travelled to South Africa to receive the International Children’s Peace Prize. Previous recipients included Pakistani girls’ education activist Malala Yousafzai and Nkosi Johnson, a South African child who fought for the rights of children with HIV. At the event in Cape Town, held to coincide with Universal Children’s Day, Bishop Desmond Tutu told representatives of the group – David Hogg, Emma González, Jaclyn Corin, Matt Deitsch, Ryan Deitsch and Delaney Tarr – their work to persuade young people to become more engaged in confronting the crisis was among the most significant youth-led mass movements in living memory. “The peaceful campaign to demand safe schools and communities, and the eradication of gun violence, is reminiscent of other great peace movements in history,” said Mr Tutu, who is patron of the KidsRights Foundation, which has organised the award for 15 years and this year oversaw 121 children from 45 countries nominated. “I am in awe of these children whose powerful message is amplified by their youthful energy and an unshakable belief that children can, no must, improve their own futures.” During the ceremony, Marc Dullaert, founder of KidsRights and the International Children’s Peace Prize, called on the international community to halt the surge in school violence witnessed internationally. “Schools must be protected as safe havens for children. KidsRights calls upon the international community to halt this issue and to prevent schools from becoming battlegrounds,” he said. Speaking from Cape Town, the six young people told The Independent they had been inspired by their visit to South Africa and the chance to meet previous recipients. Story continues “It’s an absolute honour to be up here with some incredible young people who have risen to the occasion time and time again,” said Matt Deitsch, who dropped out of college to work for the movement after the shooting, which his sister and younger brother survived. “We have only been doing this for nine months, and to be here in this room with all of them was just incredible.” The young people, who helped organise protests across the US and around the world, highlighted the National Rifle Association’s funding of many members of congress, and held a rally in Washington DC to urge young people to become more involved. While their efforts were widely praised, some on the right accused them of being naive. Conspiracy theorists even claimed the young people who had survived, after gunman Nikolas Cruz (a former student at the school) entered the premises and opened fire, were actors. The young people, including Mr Hogg and Ms González, gained support nationwide as they continued to press politicians with both passion and hard facts. “We are going to be the last mass shooting,“ Ms González told a crowd days after the shooting. “We are going to change the law. That’s going to be Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook, and it’s all going to be due to the tireless efforts of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most importantly the students.” Given that the group said it had struggled to engage with lots of Republican members of congress who had received funding from the NRA, Ms González was asked what message she might have for Nancy Pelosi. After Democrats flipped the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, it is likely the 78-year-old will become speaker and the Democrats will have the opportunity to craft legislation. “We’re saying to anyone who would listen to us, not just Nancy Pelosi but the entire government at this point,” said Ms González. Included among the 10-point plan listed on the group’s website is a demand to disarm domestic abusers, put in place tougher security for guns, introduce universal background checks, and provide grants for research into gun violence for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet, the young people said the changes needed were not simply legislative. Ryan Deitsch said the group had to continue trying to challenge the root of gun culture. “We have a culture that we have to fight, which is very much a culture centred around guns and making them as normalised as possible in society – and that is not just in America but around the world. That is something that we have to combat. That is something we have been combatting slowly,” he said. “That is something we are going to combat politically, but we have to combat this culture. And the way we do that is working with out chapters around the country and around the world. This work is not going to end any time soon that we can see, but we are prepared for the long haul.”",Emma Gonzalez David Hogg Dana Loesch Cameron Kasky Jaclyn Corin Stoneman Douglas High School shooting March for Our Lives Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School 2018 United States gun violence protests Gun control,"Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday.","Students who launched a campaign to tackle gun violence in America – and who have received an international peace award for their efforts – have urged the new congress to take up the challenge and work with them.

Diane Black must be watching some crazy violent porn, it seems. (Photo: Aaron Bernstein / Reuters) Does anyone know what kind of porn Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) is watching? Whatever it is, the 67-year-old Black, who is running for governor of Tennessee, said it’s a “big part” of what is driving the spike in school shootings. During a meeting last week with local pastors, Black raised the issue of gun violence in schools and why it keeps happening. “Pornography,” she said. “It’s available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there,” she continued. “All of this is available without parental guidance. I think that is a big part of the root cause.” Here’s an audio of her remarks, which she made during a listening session with ministers at Safe Harbor of Clarksville, Tennessee. Black didn’t clarify what it is about porn that she thinks is leading to school massacres. Her congressional spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond naughty movies, Black said school shootings are on the rise because of the “deterioration of the family,” mental illness and violent movies. There have been 23 shootings of some type this year on the campuses of K-12 schools or colleges. Of those at the K-12 schools, nine involved a gun being discharged and people being injured or killed, including a Friday shooting in Indiana school that left a teacher and a student injured. Contrary to Black’s take, experts say poor social, economic and cultural conditions are primary drivers of gun violence. Enacting policies to improve those conditions for people, along with reducing access to firearms, would go a long way in stemming mass shootings, they say. These actions are “far more effective than all the police, doctors and hospitals combined, and intervening only after tragedies have struck,” said professors James Gilligan of New York University and Bandy Lee of Yale University, both experts on violence.

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Education was considering a plan that would allow schools to buy firearms for teachers using money from a federal grant program originally designed to support student enrichment, an unprecedented step that would turn an NRA fever dream into official public policy. However, an anonymous administration official has now pushed back a bit, telling CNN on Thursday that the idea “did not originate with the Department of Education” or Secretary Betsy DeVos, and that the government was only evaluating a request from the Texas Department of Education. The federal department does not seem to have ruled the concept out entirely, however. Donald Trump broached the idea of arming teachers in order to prevent shootings after the Feb. 14 massacre in Parkland, Florida. The National Rifle Association has long advocated allowing educators carry weapons on campus, and several states already allow them. But the president’s comments thrust the issue into the middle of the national debate. According to the New York Times’ initial report, Congress typically bars schools from spending federal funding on guns. But the Department of Education has been examining whether districts could pay for weapons using Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, which were created as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015. The $1 billion program is pretty much what it sounds like: The money is intended to help schools provide students with a well-rounded education, bring technology into classrooms, and create a healthy learning environment through “comprehensive school mental health, drug and violence prevention.” But there’s nothing in the law that explicitly says the money can’t be used for setting up English teachers with pistols, and the Department of Education has supposedly been trying to figure out whether that might fall under the rubric of “improving school conditions.” The administration is now telling CNN that it only began looking into the issue after it received a letter from the Texas Department of Education asking if the grants could be used that way, and that after researching the issue, it decided not to respond. But the department doesn’t seem to have quashed the idea entirely. Per CNN: The official added that DeVos thinks that Congress should take action to clarify whether or not using the grant funding to buy guns is permissible. Moreover, the Education Department believes the grant program is intentionally vague to give school districts flexibility, and the idea of purchasing firearms was likely not considered when it was written, according to the official. In response to the Times report, Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill told CNN that “the department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety. The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” It seems unlikely that Congress will pass a bill anytime soon explicitly saying that, yes, schools can use student enrichment grants to build up a weapons cache, so perhaps deflecting to Capitol Hill is just a way of punting on the issue. Or maybe not! Still, anybody who may have thought that arming teachers to prevent school shootings was just a plainly disingenuous talking point Republicans were lobbing out to counter calls for gun control after Parkland should think again.

Safety must be the top priority at the public facility, said Steven Shewmaker, president of the nine-member 22nd District Agricultural Assn. board of directors, which oversees all activities at the fairgrounds. An incident Sunday sharpened the focus on safety at the seaside venue, when a disgruntled customer unable to get a ticket to a rap concert pulled out a handgun and began shooting. Deputies quickly returned fire, wounding the man before he hit anyone. “It just reinforces the need for improved security,” Shewmaker said Friday of the incident. Advertisement A dramatic increase in gun violence nationwide in recent years has brought new concerns about the event. The fairgrounds installed metal detectors at the show’s entrances for the first time in July. More extensive precautions, including a possible ban on all firearms, will be considered at 10 a.m. Tuesday at a fair board meeting that’s been moved from the usual headquarters on the fairgrounds to the nearby Surfside Race Place off-track betting facility to accommodate the expected crowd. Additional security also will be provided, Shewmaker said. “This in effect is banning the gun show,” said Michael Schwartz, executive director of the San Diego County Gun Owners organization and a leading advocate for the event, on Friday. “We are completely and totally opposed.” Shewmaker and one other director, Richard Valdez, are on the board’s contracts oversight committee, which made the recommendation to the board. They are suggesting the shows cease until the district “considers the feasibility of conducting gun shows for only educational and safety training purposes and bans the possession of guns and ammunition on state property.” Advertisement He and Valdez agreed on the recommendation before Sunday’s shooting at the fairgrounds, Shewmaker said. Crossroads of the West operates the gun shows at Del Mar and at numerous other large venues in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah. Crossroads owner Bob Templeton and his son, Jeff Templeton, both have felony convictions for federal firearms violations that prevent them from operating the shows. To avoid that, Bob Templeton has ceded control of the show to his daughter, Tracy Olcott, who has no record. The Del Mar fair board has asked the state Department of Justice to investigate the Templeton family’s background and whether they are qualified to run the shows. So far, the department has not responded to questions about whether an investigation is underway. Advertisement An attorney for Olcott, Tiffany D. Cheuvront, said in an Aug. 31 letter to fairgrounds Chief Executive Tim Fennell that efforts to end the gun show are discriminatory. “There is a concerted effort being made to push Crossroads out of public venues because a well-organized interest group does not agree with the beliefs of the guests who attend gun shows,” Cheuvront states. “But these gun show opponents should not be allowed to deem lawful activity ‘bad’ just because they don’t agree with it.” Any change in the Del Mar show, which has been held five weekends a year for almost 30 years, faces strident opposition from firearms enthusiasts. Hundreds of members of the San Diego County Gun Owners and the California Rifle and Pistol Assn. are expected to attend Tuesday’s meeting and ask for the renewal of the Crossroads contracts. Advertisement San Diego County Gun Owners has collected thousands of letters from county residents in support of the show. More than a dozen of those letters were submitted by various city council members, many of whom represent areas with high concentrations of firearms enthusiasts. Three city councils near the fairgrounds — Del Mar, Solana Beach and Encinitas — have passed resolutions opposing the gun shows. The Santee City Council in East County on Wednesday became the first to go on record in support of the show.

Eric Swalwell on Friday said the U.S. government would use its nuclear weapons in a hypothetical war against Second Amendment supporters refusing to give up their firearms. The California Democrat, who is openly considering a run for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2020, made the outlandish remark on social media after a gun-rights advocate pointed out that the lawmaker once called for gun owners to surrender their assault weapons. “So basically @RepSwalwell wants a war. Because that's what you would get. You're outta your f------ mind if you think I'll give up my rights and give the [government] all the power,"" Joe Biggs tweeted at Swalwell. This prompted Swalwell to defend himself, saying it would be a “short war” because “the government has nukes,” implying the government would use its nuclear arsenal against its own citizens. The comment drew an immediate backlash, with thousands of people criticizing the lawmaker for the ill-thought-out remark. “Here is an actual member of the U.S. Congress talking about using nuclear weapons against Americans,” David Freddoso wrote. “Personally, I have a bigger problem with an elected official blithely talking about nuking his fellow Americans than my neighbor owning an AR-15,” Cam Edwards tweeted. Swalwell -- a member of both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee -- tried to defuse the situation, saying the need for a firearm to protect against the government is “ludicrous” and suggested that if an assault weapon ban would happen, people would just follow the law. He later clarified that he was merely being facetious in his suggestion about the use of nuclear weapons. “I sarcastically point[ed] out USA isn't losing to his assault weapon (it's not the 18th Century),” he wrote. Meanwhile, Swalwell appeared Friday on HBO’s ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" show, talking about his potential plan to run for president, saying he’s “considering” it. The lawmaker, who will turn 40 in November 2020, would be the youngest candidate ever elected president.

""Anyone who wants these files is going to get them. I'm gonna sell it to them, I'm gonna ship them. That began this morning,"" Wilson said. ""That will never be interrupted. The free exchange of these ideas will never be interrupted."" Wilson spoke a day after a federal judge in Seattle granted a motion for a preliminary injunction that blocked him from releasing downloadable blueprints for 3D-printed guns until the litigation is resolved. Critics say the blueprints will make it easier for felons, minors and mentally ill people to potentially make their own 3D-printed guns, which they fear can be made to be untraceable. But Wilson says that the ""hysterical"" court order limited his free speech rights. The ruling came as part of a years-long battle between the federal government and Defense Distributed, an Austin, Texas-based organization that in 2013 first posted designs for a 3D-printed handgun called the Liberator. The pistol was made out of ABS plastic, the same material used in Lego blocks, and could be made on a 3D printer. The US government ordered the blueprints be taken down that year, and Wilson sued the government in 2015. The Trump administration settled the case in June, and the 3D weapon blueprints were scheduled to be posted online August 1. However, Washington state and other states sued to block the release of the blueprints that day. Judge Robert Lasnik sided with the states and temporarily blocked the settlement, although more than 1,000 people downloaded the designs before the judge's decision. Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, is selling blueprints of 3D-printed guns despite a federal court order, he said on Tuesday, August 28, 2018. At times brash and smug, Wilson pointed to one line in Judge Lasnik's decision that he said allowed him to legally sell the blueprints. ""Regulation under the (Arms Export Control Act of 1976) means that the files cannot be uploaded to the internet, but they can be emailed, mailed, securely transmitted, or otherwise published within the United States,"" the court order reads. Wilson, an open-source advocate, said he preferred to give the blueprints away for free but decided to sell them instead, comparing his decision to the downloadable music industry. ""I'm happy now to become the iTunes of downloadable guns if I can't become the Napster."" Further, he said his company would be fine, and he portrayed his inability to post gun blueprints online as a violation of free speech. ""All that's happened here because of this judge's order is perhaps the doubling or tripling of the valuation of my own company,"" he said.

A day after the rampage at the synagogue in the normally tranquil neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, loved ones and friends of the 11 people gunned down were left mourning and outraged by the explosion of deadly hate that entered their beloved place of worship. ""The fact that this attack took place during a worship service makes it even more heinous,"" Scott Brady, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, said at a news conference in Pittsburgh on Sunday morning.

""Dr. Jerry Rabinowitz was more than just a physician for me and my family; for over three decades he was truly a trusted confidant and healer who could always be counted upon to provide sage advice whenever he was consulted on medical matters, usually providing that advice with a touch of genuine humor,"" Claus told ABC affiliate station WTAE-TV in Pittsburgh. ""He had a truly uplifting demeanor, and as a practicing physician he was among the very best."" The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center tweeted that Rabinowitz was affiliated with its Shadyside Hospital. ""Jerry was above all one of the kindest physicians and human beings in our community,"" UPMC tweeted. Tami Minnier, UPMC chief quality officer, released a statement mourning the loss of Rabinowitz. ""Those of us who worked with him respected and admired his devotion to his work and faith,"" Minnier said in her statement. ""His loss is devastating, and we extend our deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and fellow UPMC colleagues who loved him."" Wax was a retired accountant and a member of the New Light congregation, which rented a space in the lower level of the Tree of Life temple, Myron Snider, an official of the New Light congregation, told the Associated Press. ""He was such a kind, kind person,"" Snider said of Wax. The Pittsburgh Steelers held a moment of silence before Sunday afternoon's football game at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh to honor the victims. ""On behalf of the entire Steelers organization, we offer our support and condolences to the families of the attack on peaceful citizens worshiping at the Tree of Life synagogue. Our hearts are heavy, but we must stand against anti-Semitism and hate crimes of any nature and come together to preserve our values and our community,"" Art Rooney II, the president of the Steelers, said in a statement. President Trump offered condolences on Twitter and ordered that flags be lowered to half-staff at the White House and other federal buildings. Erika Strassburger, a Pittsburgh City Council member who lives two blocks from the synagogue, said she knew some of those killed. ""The sadness and the fear ... was immediately apparent with the people I was with [and] was heartbreaking,"" Strassburger said on ABC's ""This Week"" Sunday morning of when she first learned of the mass shooting. ""And I got on the scene as soon as I could just to find out more. The hardest part is waiting to find out more."" On Saturday night, hundreds of community residents gathered near the synagogue for a candlelight vigil. Another vigil to remember the victims took place Sunday evening. ""For a Jewish community and especially for the families who've been affected, and it's real when once you hear the names, we're going to do everything we can to help the families,"" Jeffrey Finkelstein, the chief executive officer of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said at Sunday's news conference.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump addresses the National Rifle Association this week, a leading gun-safety group is looking to make an example out of suburban Republicans. Giffords, the organization co-founded by shooting victim and former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., will announce Thursday that it is adding five GOP lawmakers to its list of midterm targets and launching digital ads in 10 competitive House and Senate races, NBC News has learned exclusively. While the overall buy is small — $105,000 to start — the ads are a ""first step"" in an effort to show that gun-safety advocates can punish NRA-aligned lawmakers at the polls, according to Giffords political director, Isabelle James. For that reason, the group isn't running ads in open seats — only in places where a sitting member of Congress could be ousted and become a cautionary tale for former colleagues. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha ""It’s important to us that there is an incumbent in the seat,"" James said. The ads show how much money each Republican lawmaker has taken from the NRA and accuses each of being ""bought and paid for"" by the nation's leading gun-rights group. ""How does he vote?"" the narrator in an ad aimed at Rep. John Faso of New York will ask. ""You guessed it — just like the NRA tells him."" Officials at Giffords say the theme ties the gun issue to voters' increasing frustration with the influence of lobbying on policy making. In addition to Faso, the ads target one Republican senator, Dean Heller of Nevada, and nine Republicans in the House: Mimi Walters and Steve Knight of California; Jason Lewis of Minnesota; Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington; Don Bacon of Nebraska; Mike Coffman of Colorado; Vern Buchanan of Florida; Pete Sessions of Texas; and Barbara Comstock of Virginia. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., was originally on Giffords' list but was removed because he announced that he will retire at the end of the year. The Nevada Senate race and all of the House races are among the most competitive in the country, and all figure to be influenced heavily by suburban swing voters. According to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, the NRA's popularity with key groups took a hit after the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in February, including among white married women, seniors and more moderate Republicans.

When officers took the suspect into custody, he had a loaded handgun in his classroom. What happened? Detectives believe teacher Charles So battered another man in a Feb. 21 road rage incident, taking the victim's cellphone before fleeing. So is a 35-year-old language arts teacher at Chaboya Middle School, where he was arrested after a monthslong investigation. The San Jose Police Department used its MERGE Unit — the department's version of a SWAT team — in making the arrest after classes were done for the day. So now faces felony charges for robbery and possession of a firearm at a school. Speaking with KPIX-TV, San Jose Police Sgt. Enrique Garcia said of So's arrest: ""He's gonna have a very difficult time explaining why he had a loaded firearm in a classroom."" Garcia confirmed to Mercury News that the gun was registered to So. ""There is no indication at this time that he was going to use that handgun against staff or students,"" Garcia added. How did the school district react? Evergreen School District spokesman Charles Crosby expressed dismay that their employee had brought a gun on campus. ""We're appalled. It's disgraceful that any teacher would think that's an appropriate thing to do,"" Crosby told KPIX. According to Crosby, So had passed background and fingerprint checks upon his recent hiring. ""It's alarming to us that this is something that wouldn't have been flagged and not picked up in a background check"" he added. Anything else? Two parents spoke with KPIX about the incident on the condition of anonymity, saying they were upset about the news. ""You hear about it happening elsewhere. You just don't think it's gonna be happening at your school,"" said one parent. Another said, ""Someone failed. Someone dropped the ball on this.""

Giammittorio is canvassing in a state that is traditionally conservative but gradually turning to purple, and even blue, as urbanization brings a more diverse population, especially in the areas outside Washington. ""If we want the Congress to do something, we are going to have to change the people,"" Giammittorio said in the runup to the November 6 midterm elections. ""We have ineffective gun laws."" In this part of Virginia, gun issues are particularly sensitive, as America's powerful gun rights lobby, the National Rifle Association, is based here. Giammittorio belongs to Moms Demand Action, which gathers each weekend to campaign in pairs, meeting voters to discuss their work for candidates that support tougher gun controls. The right to bear arms is enshrined in the Second Amendment of the US Constitution, but the issue of gun violence is a constant political football in America. Mass shootings -- sadly commonplace in the US -- are often followed by calls for political action, which then fade into the background. And the cycle then repeats. Every day in America, firearms kill more than 90 people. Two-thirds of those are suicides. Like thousands of other moms, who wear red shirts for their cause, the 56-year-old Giammittorio is hoping for change at the ballot box. She is campaigning for Jennifer Wexton, a Democrat running for a seat in the House of Representatives against Republican incumbent Barbara Comstock, who has an ""A"" rating from the NRA for her voting record. ""Jennifer Wexton would definitely help change the balance in the House,"" said Giammittorio, who is unabashed about her work for Moms Demand Action, which is backing 3,000 ""gun sense candidates"" on the federal, state and local levels. Story continues - Millions of dollars - Giammittorio, who lives closer to Washington in Alexandria, got up on a day off to canvass in Sterling, located in Loudoun County, the scene of the Wexton-Comstock race. Wexton wants to ban assault-style weapons and bolster background checks for gun buyers, specifically to look at their criminal record and mental health history. The contest is a high-profile one, and money is being poured into both campaigns. Comstock has been dubbed ""Trumpstock"" in some ads, and is also the target of a spot featuring Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was nearly killed in a shooting attack in 2011. ""Shooting after shooting, Barbara Comstock has failed. She's taken thousands from the NRA. We must do better,"" Giffords said in the ad, which is running on local television networks. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the NRA has spent $140,000 on Comstock's campaigns since she was elected to Congress in 2014. Wexton is meanwhile backed by Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization with ties to Moms Demand Action and which is largely financed by billionaire former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg. Everytown plans to spend $20 million nationwide before Election Day on candidates in key districts who favor gun curbs. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. - Not easy to sway voters - Giammittorio is doing what she can -- she knocked on about 40 doors in Sterling on this particular day of canvassing, but received less than a warm welcome in some cases. There is ""no such thing"" as loopholes in legislation on gun purchases, said one man who called himself an ""unbiased Republican"" and said he owned a gun for hunting. Undaunted, Giammittorio urges him to change his mind, revealing her personal story. Her sister-in-law went to answer the door, she explains, and a mentally unstable man targeted her for no apparent reason. ""I came to realize how lax our gun laws are in the United States,"" Giammittorio says of her own experience. ""We have gun laws that are not really designed to keep people from getting guns."" - Candidates under fire - Alongside Giammittorio is Elizabeth Coppage, who is the local leader for Moms Demand Action in Loudoun County. She says she believes their work is important. ""I do think we have a chance of flipping this district,"" says the 45-year-old Coppage, who is pounding the pavement with her daughter. Coppage says she started working on gun violence issues in 2012, as a way to channel her anger over the Sandy Hook school shooting that left 26 people dead in Connecticut, 20 of them young children. Despite the national outrage over that deadly shooting spree by a lone gunman, little changed at the federal level in terms of gun legislation. The gun control debate reared its ugly head once again earlier this year after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida that left 17 people dead, most of them teenage students. Survivors of the attack have become vocal activists, spearheading the ""March For Our Lives"" in March, which brought together more than a million people nationwide, including a massive crowd in Washington. ""There is now greater pressure on candidates in many places to address the issue, in part because of the response to the Parkland shootings,"" said Robert Spitzer, a professor of political science and expert on gun politics at the State University of New York at Cortland.

Hogg, 17, asked in a reply to a McCain Twitter message about the Phoenix-area ""Rio Reimagined"" redevelopment project that was launched Friday. McCain's office could not immediately be reached for comment, and McCain had not responded to Hogg's question on Twitter. McCain, a six-term Arizona Republican who was the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, is the No. 1 recipient of NRA money among current members of Congress, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Throughout his long career in politics, including the 2008 presidential race, McCain has gotten a $7.7 million boost from the NRA, the non-partisan center found. McCain, 81, is now battling a deadly form of brain cancer called glioblastoma. McCain's health has kept him in Arizona since before Christmas and it is unclear when he will return to Capitol Hill. He is not expected to seek a seventh Senate term in 2022. In 2013, McCain also took heat from the right for supporting a bipartisan compromise on gun-purchase background checks that ultimately did not clear the Senate. McCain was one of only four Republicans to vote for the legislation offered by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. Hogg has emerged as a vocal critic of the NRA after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.

Two of the school’s highest-profile activists, David Hogg and Emma González, have become the focus of a particularly troll-like strain of pro-gun anger and this week were likened to Nazis, Communists, and anti-American traitors. The attacks now come not just from the alt-right and anonymous Twitter louts. Since the weekend’s massive marches for gun control, more and more prominent figures in media and politics are aiming previously unfathomable public attacks at the youngsters. The derision came early, in the form of the conspiracy theories from the usual sources. Radicals on Twitter were accusing the students of being actors even as news reports of the Feb. 14 shooting were still coming in, and conspiracy-theory king Alex Jones quickly spread these falsehoods further—despite eventual pushback from internet platforms. Fast-forward a month, and we began to see fabricated attacks like this viral GIF altered to show Emma González appearing to tear up the U.S. Constitution, which caught on during the March for Our Lives. At its peak, it was shared by actor Adam Baldwin, who in the caption of the now-deleted tweet compared her to a member of the Hitler Youth. (In the real video, published by Teen Vogue, González tore up a gun-range target.) Hogg, meanwhile, has been repeatedly smeared in memes likening him to Adolf Hitler. All in favor of Gun Control raise your right arm! pic.twitter.com/B9LmDMQzph — Eddie B. #Trump2020 (@edbenson98) March 28, 2018 In notable instances of prominent people making bizarre critiques of the Parkland students, Iowa Rep. Steve King’s campaign Facebook page mocked González for wearing a Cuba flag patch on her jacket. “This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens,” the Facebook post read. “[H]ence their right to self defense.” The campaign team then defended itself by saying the “meme in question” was “obviously” not an attack on González’s heritage but “merely points out the irony of someone pushing gun control while wearing the flag of a country that was oppressed by a communist, anti-gun regime.” (It also seemed to say that González should speak Spanish, despite the fact that King has said before that “Assimilation, not diversity, is our American strength.” Also, the Cuban flag predates Castro’s regime.) King might be the most prominent politician to attack the Parkland students individually, but he isn’t the only one. As a testimony to the pervasive influence of conspiracy-mongering pro-gun conservatives online, local political figures have given in to liking, sharing, and echoing arguments untethered to facts but strong in conviction, intended only to undermine the efforts of these teenage victims. Or, feeding off partisan anger, they have simply resorted to insults. Here are more examples of such attacks from political figures: Benjamin Kelly, Aide to Florida State Rep. Shawn Harrison On Feb. 20, Ben Kelly emailed a Tampa Bay Times reporter, unsolicited, with a then-shocking statement about Hogg and González. “Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen,” he said in the email. When the Times asked for evidence supporting his claim, Kelly sent an email, still from his official government account, linking to a conspiracy video showing Hogg in a news clip in California as evidence he was a crisis actor. “There is a clip on you tube that shows Mr. Hogg out in California,” Kelly wrote. “(I guess he transferred?)” Harrison told a reporter that Kelly should not have sent the email. He then said he placed Kelly on leave and that Kelly shared the statement “without my knowledge.” Kelly was then fired by state House Speaker Richard Corcoran. The day before, on his personal Twitter account, according to the Times, Kelly liked a tweet calling González a “brown bald lesbian girl.” Leslie Gibson, Republican Candidate for the Maine State House Just over two weeks ago, when Gibson was running unopposed for the seat, he said in a since-deleted tweet that “There is nothing about this skinhead lesbian that impresses me and there is nothing that she has to say unless you’re a frothing at the mouth moonbat.” The tweet was referring to González, who is openly bisexual and who has a buzz cut. He also called Hogg a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.” In the outrage that ensued, some state legislators condemned his comments, and Hogg took to Twitter to ask people to run against Gibson. Two challengers surfaced just days later, and Gibson withdrew from the race. “I am walking away with my head held high,” he said. Anthony Testaverde, Longtime Aide to New York State Sen. Martin Golden On Saturday, Testaverde shared on Facebook a photo of Hogg holding his right fist in the air at the March for Our Lives demonstration. Next to it was a historical photo of Hitler saluting. Below, an image of Hogg wearing a black mourning band was compared to a photo of a Nazi swastika armband. “I knew something was off about this kid,” the post declares. The comparison of the Parkland activists and other gun control advocates to Nazis cites a historically flawed argument that has long persisted in pro-gun circles about the Third Reich taking away German citizens’ guns, preventing effective resistance. “The Democrats are doing exactly what Hitler did,” Testaverde wrote in another post. “He used the youth to disarm and control the people. This is scary!” Sen. Golden faced loud criticism for the actions of his aide, and he publicly condemned Testaverde’s posts as “offensive” and “misguided” but refused to say he would fire him. On Tuesday, Testaverde was fired. Mary Franson, Minnesota State Representative On Saturday night, Franson shared a Facebook post that referred to Hogg as “Supreme Leader.” She then shared a quote, via the conservative site the Daily Wire, from the March for Our Lives speech by Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old Parkland survivor, who said, “When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile!” Franson’s commentary above that quote was “And there you have it friends … the anti gunners, the high school students who speak for all, aren’t interested in an ‘inch’. They want the mile. They want your guns. Gone.” The kicker, though, came about 15 minutes later when she posted a link from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum website titled, “Shaping the Future: Indoctrinating Youth.” Above, she quoted Hitler talking about indoctrination. Later, as she faced criticism over linking Parkland survivors to Nazi youths, she argued that the indoctrination post was unrelated to her earlier posts and denounced the media for making the connection. If more proof was needed that insults and conspiracy theories have mainstream power, Donald Trump Jr. liked two tweets attacking Hogg. In one, conservative TV host Graham Ledger linked an article from Gateway Pundit and suggested Hogg, whose father is a former FBI agent, was “running cover” for his father because the FBI “botched” tracking down the shooter. Trump Jr. liked another tweet peddling the same conspiracy with a post from a far-right website about the “Outspoken Trump-Hating School Shooting Survivor” that doubted Hogg was an actual victim and blamed the “Deep State media” for giving him a platform. Given that the Parkland student-activists are still working to encourage more town hall events and more demonstrations, it seems likely these teenagers will face evermore vile personal and public attacks in the months to come. Although we cannot expect any personal responsibility from internet trolls, Americans should expect better from public officials, who have the power to lend legitimacy to the more disgraceful arguments circling around social media. But in the instances above, the public responded by rejecting the hateful arguments, and proved we have the power to hold these politicians to account.",Emma Gonzalez Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Stoneman Douglas High School shooting David Hogg School shooting Never Again MSD  Gun violence Gun control Gun,"David Hogg, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, has been attacked by pro-gun advocates.","The longer the Parkland students continue their protests around gun control, the more they are being targeted by worsening insults, lies, and unhinged accusations.

459,100044,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-touts-death-penalty-pittsburgh-002518191.html,Trump Touts Death Penalty After Pittsburgh Synagogue Shooting,"President Donald Trump on Saturday encouraged a revival of the death penalty while condemning the deadly mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue allegedly carried out by an anti-Semitic gunman. “When you have crimes like this, whether it’s one, or another one on another group, we have to bring back the death penalty,” Trump said, speaking at a rally in Murphysboro, Illinois. “They have to pay the ultimate price,” he added. “They can’t do this. They can’t do this to our country. We must draw a line in the sand and say, ‘Never again.’” The president called for stronger death penalty laws earlier Saturday before another speech at the Future Farmers of America Convention in Indiana. “When people do this, they should get the death penalty,” Trump said. “Anybody that does a thing like this to innocent people that are in temple or in church ― we’ve had so many incidents with churches ― they should be suffering the ultimate price.” ...This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 27, 2018 Suspected gunman Robert Bowers, 46, is accused of opening fire inside of the crowded Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Saturday morning, killing at least 11 people and injuring six others. Officials said Bowers announced his presence to the congregation by shouting, “All Jews must die,” before the attack. Bowers, who reportedly had an “assault rifle” and at least three handguns, was later arrested on the third floor of the building after exchanging fire with police. The shooting is considered one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish people in recent U.S. history. Trump strongly condemned anti-Semitism early in his speech during Saturday’s rally, calling the shooting a “monstrous killing of Jewish Americans.” Story continues “This evil anti-Semitic attack is an assault on all of us. It’s an assault on humanity,” Trump said. “It will require all of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-Semitism from our world.” Saturday’s deadly mass shooting follows the arrest of Cesar Sayoc, 56, a Trump supporter who is suspected of mailing out explosive devices to people Trump opposes. Sayoc’s alleged targets included prominent Democrats such as the Clintons, the Obamas, Democrats in Congress, and CNN’s New York headquarters. Speaking at a North Carolina rally on Thursday, Trump blamed the media’s negative coverage of him for the heightened political tension in the U.S. The president also urged Democrats and the media to be more civil, ignoring his most recent rallies, in which he encouraged violence against journalists and promoted fear-mongering against immigrants. Trump supported the death penalty long before his political career. In 1989, the real estate mogul took out full-page newspaper ads urging lawmakers to “bring back the death penalty” in response to a group known as the Central Park Five who were wrongly convicted of attacking a female jogger. While Trump called for the “ultimate” punishment for Saturday’s suspected gunman, the question of whether the death penalty deters people from committing murder is still up for debate. At least 20 states have either abolished or overturned the death penalty, according to the nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center. Earlier this month Washington state’s Supreme Court declared capital punishment unconstitutional. A 2012 scientific review, partially funded by the Justice Department, said there was not enough research that proves the death penalty affects homicide rates and deters the crime.

Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband Mark Kelly's pre-midterms tour will be at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, one day after the first anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. (Photo: Gary Cameron / Reuters) Former Arizona Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011, is set to campaign across the political map over the next month to boost Democratic candidates who support gun control. Giffords, who now leads an eponymous gun safety group with her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, will start the tour on Oct. 2 in Las Vegas, one day after the one-year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. The event, at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, will include a roundtable discussion with gun violence survivors and a canvass kickoff event with Tom Steyer, the California businessman and potential presidential candidate. Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords, said the number of candidates requesting to campaign with the former congresswoman has skyrocketed in recent years as mass shootings have continued and the Democratic Party has fully embraced gun control as part of its political platform. “The politics around guns has shifted demonstrably. It’s a departure from several years ago,” he said. “There are dozens of candidates around the country who recognize their path to victory revolves around their support for gun safety.” Most of the stops, Ambler said, will focus on the suburban House districts Democrats hope will pave the way for their majority in 2019. Besides Las Vegas, Gabby Giffords will also campaign in Orange County, California ― home to four competitive House seats ― and in Minneapolis and Houston. They’ll also campaign in the Pacific Northwest, traveling to Oregon for Democratic Gov. Kate Brown, who is facing a surprisingly competitive re-election bid; and to Washington state, where they’ll support an ambitious referendum to require enhanced background checks for semiautomatic weapons. Two of the stops ― in Minneapolis and in Houston ― will also include participants from the March for Our Lives, which formed to organize young people after the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Story continues Ambler said to expect additional stops on the journey, dubbed the #VotesSaveLives tour. The Giffords organization has already spent $4 million attacking three Republicans with backing from the National Rifle Association: Rep. Barbara Comstock in Virginia, Rep. Mike Coffman in Colorado and Rep. Jason Lewis in Minnesota. Love HuffPost? Become a founding member of HuffPost Plus today.

On Monday afternoon, four people, including gunman Juan Lopez, died after he opened fire in Chicago’s Mercy Hospital, police said. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson confirmed that 32-year-old Lopez shot and killed his ex-fiancé who worked at the hospital, another hospital employee and a police officer who attempted to apprehend him. Lopez apparently had a history of making threats and pulling out his gun. According to the Chicago Tribune, in 2013 Lopez had threatened to shoot up the Chicago Fire Academy and was fired for “improper conduct toward women.” The Chicago Fire Academy’s department Spokesman Larry Langford told the Tribune he could not confirm if the threats were made towards women. “He was accused of aggressive and improper conduct toward females at the academy,” Langford told the Tribune. “He was disciplined and terminated.” The Sun Times reported that Lopez was married in 2008, and in 2014 his wife filed a petition for an order of protection against him. The petition alleged that Lopez slept with a pistol under his pillow, and that he left the gun out where their small child could reach it, the Sun Times said. In the petition Lopez’s wife also claimed that he had pulled his gun on multiple people including a neighbor and a realtor after forgetting about a scheduled apartment appraisal. His wife also claimed that once she began separation proceedings, Lopez sent her a text on Dec. 1, 2014, threatening “to come to my job and cause a scene.” the Sun Times reported. Police confirmed Lopez had a concealed carry permit and had legally purchased four weapons within the past five years. According to the Tribune, Lopez worked for the Chicago Housing Authority since February 2018 as an associate program specialist. The Chicago Housing Authority issued a statement and said he was hired after undergoing a background check. Story continues “There is no history of complaints about him during the course of his employment at CHA.” they told the Tribune. Mercy Hospital identified the victims as Dr. Tamera O’Neal, Officer Samuel Jimenez and Dayna Less. According to the Chicago Sun Times, 38-year-old O’Neal, an emergency room physician, had broken off her engagement with Lopez months ago. “Family had talked to her and basically said, ‘Cut your ties because you just can’t be friends with someone in situations like that,’” O’Neal’s father told the paper. “He couldn’t let go and he took her away from us.” O’Neal was shot repeatedly in the hospital parking lot after an argument with Lopez, police said.

Protests at NRA’s first annual meeting since Parkland Gun control activists are to meet 80,000 National Rifle Association supporters in Dallas this weekend, where the gun lobby is hosting its annual three-day meeting. The convention is being held less than two months after the push for gun control drew thousands to protests across the country and inspired one of the largest student demonstrations in US history. An additional stressor for the NRA is the impact these actions and Donald Trump’s divisiveness will have on the Republican party heading into the November midterms. The Guardian’s Lois Beckett has done a great breakdown of the six threats facing the NRA here and will be reporting from the convention all weekend. Trump, whose campaign accepted more than $30m from the NRA in 2016, spoke Friday afternoon at the first day of the convention. “Thanks to your activism and dedication. You have an administration fighting to protect your second amendment and we will protect your second amendment,” he said. And if you’re wondering why the NRA is so powerful, the Guardian US business editor, Dominic Rushe, has the answer here. Teacher backs immigrants and refugees in moment with Trump At the White House this week, the National Teacher of the Year staged a silent protest by wearing overtly political badges, including one with a poster for the Women’s March, when she accepted her award from Trump. Mandy Manning, who leads a classroom for teenage refugees in Washington, also wore badges that supported the LGBT community to the annual ceremony. Manning told the Associated Press that in a private moment with Trump she gave the president letters written by her students and the community that she hoped would convey what coming to the US means for refugees and immigrants. Story continues Immigration lawyers have warned repeatedly that White House policies are slowing immigration to the US. And refugee groups have been sounding an alarm about the the fall in refugee admissions this fiscal year. Only 10,584 people have been admitted in the past six months, compared with 39,000 refugee admissions in the same period in 2017, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The annual ceremony took place against the backdrop of teachers’ strikes in Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Oklahoma and West Virginia amid complaints over stagnant pay and shrinking pensions.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo By Ross Kerber BOSTON (Reuters) - Funds run by BlackRock Inc <BLK.N> and Vanguard Group backed all directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co Inc <RGR.N> despite the company's rare rejection of talks with the world's top asset managers, disclosures to regulators on Thursday showed. The votes by the gunmaker's largest investors stood in contrast to support BlackRock and Vanguard gave to a measure calling on Sturm Ruger to report on the safety of its products, which passed over the board's objections at the company's annual meeting on May 9. Neither BlackRock nor Vanguard would discuss in detail their votes at the meeting. It drew attention amid a nationwide youth-led gun control movement following a mass shooting at a Florida high school in February that killed 17 people, one in a decades-long series of shootings at U.S. schools, colleges and workplaces. Sturm Ruger declined to comment on the filings by the funds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. BlackRock holds about 18 percent of shares outstanding, followed by Vanguard, with about 10 percent. Both fund firms rarely vote against directors, and say critical votes may come only after companies fail to respond to shareholder concerns. Since July, BlackRock and Vanguard said in separate ""investment stewardship"" reports that they had held talks with other U.S. public companies that make or sell civilian firearms. Investors and activists with a range of views about gun control said the asset managers' split tickets seemed to reflect an approach designed to appeal to young investors concerned with social issues, without alienating clients who own guns or pushing Sturm Ruger's board too quickly. The big fund firms ""have to look at sensitivities"" of their clients and business partners, said Brian Rafn, principal of Morgan Dempsey Capital Management in Milwaukee, who described himself as a gun-rights supporter and says the firm voted all its 80,000 or so shares with Sturm Ruger's management. Eli Kasargod-Staub, co-founder of Majority Action, a group that had campaigned for top funds to vote against Sturm Ruger director Sandra Froman, a past president of the National Rifle Association, called the votes ""a failure of leadership"" by the fund managers. ""The only plausible explanation to me is that they were simply trying to avoid controversy,"" he said. BlackRock spokeswoman Tara McDonnell said via email it takes a case-by-case approach to its engagement and voting ""because doing so encourages change over time and promotes responsible business practices that align with the financial interests of our clients."" In a statement emailed by spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann, Vanguard said that while a company's willingness to engage can affect its voting decisions, corporate moves to improve shareholder value ""may unfold over the course of a few years, rather than a few months."" Sturm Ruger is unusual in that its executives and directors will not talk with investors directly, at a time both big passive managers have stressed more engagement with companies in their portfolios. Sturm Ruger Chief Executive Officer Christopher Killoy at the May meeting said it does not meet with top holders including BlackRock and Vanguard because of fair-disclosure rules, a rare stance. BlackRock voted against Exxon directors over similar discussion limits in the past, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier this year told CEOs that ""engagement needs to be a year-round conversation about improving long-term value."" BlackRock and Vanguard said they would contact gunmakers after the Florida shooting. Sturm Ruger said previously its directors each won more than 10 million votes at the May 9 meeting. The most votes withheld from any director was 425,763. Thursday's filings showed funds including BlackRock's iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF <IJR.P> and Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund <VB.P> voted for all nine directors, and for the safety report. In a July 20 ""investment stewardship"" report BlackRock said it had talks with ""nearly all"" 13 U.S. public gun manufacturers or sellers. The company also said that at one unidentified gunmaker that did not allow shareholder talks, it voted for a safety report. Vanguard's similar report in mid-August said that during the 12 months ended June 30, it spoke with three gunmakers and supported a shareholder resolution calling for more risk disclosure at a company it did not identify. Vanguard wrote that in its outreach, ""our objective is not to change what business a company is in or what product it produces, but rather to ensure that the risks of these choices are understood by the market and reflected in the company's long-term value to investors.""

Julie Kraemer, superintendent of the 320-student rural Hutsonville, Ill., school district, has been an educator for 20 years. Kraemer told Time magazine that she was motivated to become a law enforcement officer amid rising concerns about school shootings. ADVERTISEMENT “If somebody comes in to try to hurt my kids, we have something other than a stapler to throw at them. We’re no longer a soft target. We have some options,” the 51-year-old educator said. “I’m just going to be a superintendent that happens to also be a police officer. ... I have to be able to protect my kids.” Kraemer’s district did not have the budget to hire a full-time school resource officer, according to Time. She began her training last year after one student at a neighboring high school was shot by a peer in the cafeteria. A teacher disarmed the student in that shooting, which took place three months before the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. “I think sometimes we sit back and think it’ll never happen here, it’ll never happen to us, it’s states away,” Kraemer told Time. “But that was really close to home.” Kraemer previously had a concealed carry license before she began her law enforcement training, but said she thinks police training should be “essential” if educators want to carry weapons on a school campus. The national discussion on school safety has intensified in the wake of the Parkland shooting. Trump administration officials have expressed support for arming teachers, drawing criticism from Democrats and gun-safety advocates, many of whom called for stronger gun control laws.

Chuck Doan, director of the Southern Illinois Criminal Justice Training Program, told Time that Kraemer is the first educator he has seen undergo the training for the purpose of school safety. “Although I think it’s kind of a sad state of affairs, it’s important that we have people in our schools who can make a police response when necessary, whether that’s in the form of a police officer assigned by the department or someone like Julie,” Doan said.",Gun Concealed carry Firearm Weapon Gun safety Gun ownership Rifle Semi-automatic firearm Gun control Shooting,"A student at the school in Hutsonville, Ill., last week.","A school superintendent in Illinois carried a concealed weapon to school for the first time last week, after completing police academy training to her protect her students against a school shooter.

They never envisioned those dreams ending at the hands of a gunman in her school, and now they want other parents to avoid the immeasurable sorrow they continue to experience. Sheikh was one of 10 people – eight students and two teachers – killed in the May 18 shooting at Santa Fe High School outside Houston. On Wednesday, her parents – Abdul Aziz and Farah Naz – joined six other families in a lawsuit against the parents of suspected shooter Dimitrios Pagourtzis. Sheikh, 17, was less than three weeks away from completing her exchange program and returning home to Karachi when she became one of the victims in the nation’s second-deadliest school shooting this year. “No other parent should ever have to experience this unbearable grief,” Sheikh’s parents said in a statement. “Sabika’s picture is in front of our eyes every single moment, and her voice and laughter echo in our ears. For a mother and a father, this trauma and mourning stay until their last breath.’’ The lawsuit alleges that Antonio Pagourtzis and his wife, Rose Marie Kosmetatos, were negligent in storing the weapons their son used to carry out the massacre and ignored signs that he might harm himself or others. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who was then 17 and a junior at the school, has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault on a peace officer. He admitted to the shooting spree after being arrested. In addition to pursuing more than $1 million in damages, Aziz and Naz see the lawsuit as a way to shed light on the gun culture in the United States, their lawyer said. “They had no knowledge of that before Sabika was killed,’’ Molly Thomas-Jensen said. “It’s part of a broader conversation that the U.S. has an anomalous problem with gun violence.’’ Thomas-Jensen works as counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control advocacy group that is providing part of the legal representation for the Aziz-Naz family while highlighting the issue of safe storage of firearms. More:Dad says Santa Fe shooting suspect was bullied; school rejects claim More:School shootings and mental health: Inside the minds of mass shooters The organization has helped defend gun-storage ordinances against legal challenges by the NRA in two cities in Washington State, including Seattle. Authorities have said Dimitrios Pagourtzis used his father’s legally-owned shotgun and revolver in his shooting rampage, and also brought explosive devices that did not detonate to the school. It is not clear how the weapons were stored – Antonios Pagourtzis reportedly told Greek station Antenna TV that his son took them from his closet – but neither the elder Pagourtzis nor his wife has been charged. Texas law says guns can’t be made accessible to children under 17, with certain exceptions. However, Dimitrios Pagourtzis was already 17 at the time of the attack. Defense lawyer Ron Rodgers, who represents the elder Pagourtzis and Kosmetatos, told USA TODAY via email that his clients are heartbroken over the tragedy. “While it is perhaps natural for those looking for someone to blame for the acts of a child to point the finger at the parents, the fact is that many of the allegations concerning my clients are either inaccurate or wholly untrue,’’ Rodgers wrote. “The allegation that my clients were negligent in storing their weapons is not supported by the evidence. The claim that the guns were taken from the closet is entirely false. They were kept in a locked gun cabinet. At this point, I can only surmise that this allegation was based on inaccurate translation. There are other statements attributed to Mr. Pagourtzis in his interview with Greek media that were translated incorrectly.’’ The lawsuit charges the parents not only failed to secure the weapons, but also neglected to take action even though their son “harbored violent and hateful impulses.’’ The list of examples cited in the complaint include a fascination with the Columbine school killings of 1999 and a habit of dressing like the shooters, the keen interest in firearms Dimitrios Pagourtzis demonstrated on social media and his uploading to his Facebook page of a photo with a T-shirt bearing the words, “BORN TO KILL.’’ Eric Tirschwell, litigation director for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the signs were strong enough for Pagourtzis’ parents to at least make sure he could not access the weapons. “If you make the decision to have firearms in your home, you have a responsibility to make sure they are secure, and in particularly in a situation where you have a household member, a child or otherwise, who is exhibiting behavior that would cause any reasonable person to be alarmed,"" Tirschwell said.",Santa Fe High School shooting Sabika Sheikh Pakistan School shooting Santa Fe School  Student Shooting Student exchange program,"A memorial for Sabika Aziz Sheikh, 17, who was killed in the Santa Fe shooting.","When Sabika Aziz Sheikh’s parents sent her to the United States as an exchange student from their native Pakistan in August 2017, they saw the opportunity as a step forward in her pursuit of a career in business.

240,10120,https://sg.news.yahoo.com/trump-briefly-responds-santa-fe-162723361.html,Trump Briefly Responds To Santa Fe School Shooting Before Pivoting,"President Donald Trump expressed “sadness and heartbreak” over the deadly shooting at a high school in Texas on Friday morning. He spoke for around 90 seconds ahead of planned remarks on prison reform during a summit at the White House. “This has been going on too long in our country. Too many years, too many decades now,” the president said of school shootings. He called the Texas incident “absolutely horrific.” The attack at Santa Fe High School left at least eight dead, according to local news outlets citing law enforcement. Santa Fe, Texas, is around 35 miles southeast of Houston. “To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High, we’re with you in this tragic hour and we’ll be with you forever,” Trump said. “My administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students, secure our schools, and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others.” “Everyone must work together at every level of government to keep our children safe,” the president continued. “May God heal the injured and may God comfort the wounded, and may God be with the victims and with the victims’ families.” “Very sad day,” the president added. “Very, very sad.” “On another note, a very positive note, I’m honored to be here today with so many leaders across the nation who are committed to the crucial issue of prison reform,” Trump said in an awkward pivot to his planned remarks. A shooter has been arrested and another person of interest has been detained, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez announced. A fire alarm prompted students to flee the school, and the situation had been “contained” by late Friday morning, officials said. The total number of injured is not yet known. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston is accepting patients from the school. Trump reportedly spoke with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and pledged to “provide all appropriate federal assistance.” The incident in Santa Fe marks the 22nd U.S. school shooting of 2018, by CNN’s count. Trump ― who spoke at the National Rifle Association’s annual convention earlier this month alongside Vice President Mike Pence ― has been sharply criticized for seemingly siding with the gun lobby against those pushing for gun policy reform in the wake of the February massacre in Parkland, Florida. No major gun reform legislation has been passed during Trump’s administration. In the weeks after the Valentine’s Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which left 17 dead, the president proposed a plan that would arm some school personnel in an effort to make educational facilities safer. Many in education and law enforcement argued that the president’s plan would have the opposite effect. Love HuffPost? Become a founding member of HuffPost Plus today.

Whatever your religious beliefs may be, that much is without dispute. In time, humans formed complex societies to take advantage of the benefits of living in groups. With larger populations, it’s easier to hunt, domesticate animals, and farm. As competing groups began fighting with one another over access to resources, including land and animals, it became necessary to form what we think of today as fortified towns and cities, along with armies to wage wars. This, of course, required people appointing rulers and investing them with tremendous amounts of power and wealth. And over time, very few people could call themselves truly free. It is natural and in keeping with much of human history for people to trade their liberties for security, so it’s quite understandable why so many today are clamoring to bargain away their Second Amendment rights in the hope of preventing another school shooting like the tragic one that recently occurred in Parkland, Florida. In a post-modern world, where truth is deemed to be subjective and concepts like “right” and wrong” are taboo, it’s not surprising that in a time of crisis, people are running toward those who are promising they can make the horror, death, and devastation go away. People are so thirsty for answers, they’d drink the sand if the all-powerful government told them it was water. And while pundits of all political persuasions, myself included, debate the importance (or dangers, depending on your views) of firearms, the larger, more obvious problem remains curiously out of reach: The reason hundreds of people are being murdered in the streets of Chicago, 17 children were murdered in Parkland, and thousands of others are killed each year (mostly by people who illegally possess guns) is that our souls are desperately corrupt, sick, immoral and, as Christians often say, “fallen.” It’s not surprising to see non-Christians roll their eyes when such an observation is made. The popular, widely available view in today’s America is that people are generally good, kind, and interested in helping one another, and if greedy, self-serving, gun-toting hicks were to get out of the way of the government, we could finally solve all the world’s problems with universal health care schemes and far-reaching gun bans. Put your faith in the government, they say, and all will be well. This view makes sense if one believes government is his or her highest authority, but an increasing number of Christians are beginning to put their faith in government, too, always believing we’re just one more law away from a near-perfect society. At best, this is a sign of Christian ignorance. At worst, it’s heresy. The Bible couldn’t be clearer when it comes to the state of man: “None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one. … Their feet are swift to shed blood; in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known.” (Romans 3:10-12, 3:15-17) Elsewhere, Paul the Apostle refers to humans as “slaves to sin,” and describes in heart-wrenching detail how “nothing good lives” in him, “for I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do. Instead, I keep on doing the evil I do not want to do. And if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it.” (Romans 7:18-20) Paul’s remedy for a sick, utterly hopeless heart isn’t gun control, taxes, another welfare program, or anything of the kind; it’s faith. Through faith, hearts are born anew, the lame walk and the dead live forever. Or, as Jesus put plainly, “with God, all things are possible.” (Matthew 19:26) If you think Christianity is rubbish, then all this sounds like utter nonsense. But if your heart has been transformed by the power of God, then there’s no excuse for believing man can solve the ills of the world apart from God, because God has plainly said it’s impossible. I don’t think it’s an accident that the birth of the American nation followed shortly after the Great Awakening of the early to mid-18th century. It was then that pastors such as George Whitefield traveled some 5,000 miles preaching on more than 350 occasions to crowds of thousands about the necessity of God and humans’ broken nature. Some estimate Whitefield delivered his message to almost one-quarter of all Americans in less than two years. Following such a massive revival, the colonists were readier than ever to tell the monarchs of Europe that a free, independent, and Godly people don’t need a centralized authority to keep them safe or to solve their problems. In fact, they would have been better equipped than ever to make the case that no authority save God alone could achieve such a feat. Contrast that generation with our own. Without God, who can we turn to for “salvation,” the definition of which shifts from day to day, hour to hour? No one except the only authority in our lives powerful enough to promise peace: government. The more I study history, the more convinced I’ve become that there is no long-term hope for freedom in a Godless country. In the end, people will always choose to trade away their liberty for the illusion of security. How quickly we’d drink the sand for the momentary peace that comes with believing that, despite all reason, it might quench our thirst. We don’t need government to stop mass shootings. We don’t need Democrats or Republicans. We don’t need bump-stock bans or age restrictions. How completely foolish we are for believing people like Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer or even Donald Trump can fix what the Scriptures say are a fundamentally spiritual problem. No, we don’t need more government. We need new hearts. We need a new Great Awakening.

583,13,http://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/31/us/3d-guns-downloaded-plans-states/index.html,A judge ruled that a website has to suspend downloads for 3D gun plans. But they're already out there,"(CNN) A federal judge Tuesday night ruled it is illegal to post blueprints for 3D-printable guns online, but hundreds of designs reportedly were downloaded before the judge's decision, meaning those designs are out there -- legally or not. Judge Robert Lasnik, siding with states that argued the postings could help criminals and terrorists manufacture such weapons, temporarily blocked a settlement that would have allowed Defense Distributed, a Texas-based gun rights organization, to legally post blueprints for 3D-printable guns. ""This is a nationwide ban. ... It takes us back to a period of time before the federal government flipped on their policy regarding these 3D ghost guns,"" Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said on ""Anderson Cooper 360˚"". ""What it means is if anyone posts this information online, they are in violation of federal law and can suffer very serious consequences. So, it makes it unlawful to post that information and make it available to the public."" The issue will go back to court on August 10, when the sides will discuss whether a preliminary injunction is needed. Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson said he has effectively shut down his site for now as a result of Lasnik's decision. ""By order of a federal judge in the Western District of Washington, http://DEFCAD.com is going dark,"" he tweeted. JUST WATCHED Watch: CNN speaks to creator of 3D printed gun Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Watch: CNN speaks to creator of 3D printed gun 03:56 Tuesday's decision is the latest chapter is a yearslong struggle between Defense United and gun control advocates who argue that such weapons would be without serial numbers and therefore untraceable, that they could be in some cases undetectable by metal detectors, and that they would enable more people to get guns without submitting to background checks. Another organization, the Firearms Policy Coalition, posted the plans online, saying it ""does not recognize"" the court order. Spokesman Craig DeLuz said the group in Sacramento, California, downloaded the information from Defense Distributed when the site was operating. He said others have made the information available online, as well. How we got here Wilson had been in a multiyear legal battle with the federal government since 2013, when he posted designs in 2013 for a 3D-printed handgun he called the Liberator. The single-shot pistol was made almost entirely out of ABS plastic -- the same material Lego blocks are made from -- and could be made on a 3D printer. The files also included plans for a tabletop, computer numerical control milling machine that could carve, rather than print, other gun parts out of aluminum, according to court documents. In 2013, the US government made Defense Distributed take the blueprints down, saying they would violate International Traffic in Arms Regulations, potentially allowing someone in a country to which the United States doesn't sell weapons to download the plans to make their own guns. Wilson sued the federal government in 2015, and the Trump administration settled the case in June. But Washington and other states asked Lasnik to halt the settlement -- and Lasnik found the government didn't follow procedure when agreeing to it. ""Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits of their Administrative Procedure Act claim,"" the judge wrote. CNN reached out to Josh Blackman, an attorney for Defense Distributed, for comment. Ferguson announced Monday he was leading the lawsuit , which originally involved eight states and the District of Columbia. The petition for the temporary restraining order was filed in federal court in Seattle. Iowa and Virginia joined the case on Tuesday. The Liberator, Wilson's plastic pistol, would contain a 6-ounce piece of steel that can be removed, raising the possibility that walk-through metal detectors would not detect the guns, Ferguson and other states' attorneys general alleged in the lawsuit before Lasnik. Gun control advocates have warned that such weapons would be made without serial numbers and be largely untraceable by law enforcement. Proliferation of 3D printing plans also would make it easier for people who cannot pass criminal background checks to access guns, they say. But Alan Gottlieb, a founder and vice president of the Second Amendment Foundation, told CNN's ""Cuomo Prime Time"" that it was a matter of applying the First Amendment to protect citizens' Second Amendment rights. He said some communities are losing access to firearms sellers because of local laws. ""If you're allowed to own a firearm in your own home,"" he said, ""you should be able to make the firearm in your own home if you can't buy one locally because of crazy restrictions."" What it takes to make 3D printed guns The high-end 3D printers needed to make such weapons cost thousands of dollars. Mitch Free, chairman and CEO of the ZYCI manufacturing company in Atlanta, says he believes such a printer would cost $3,000 to $5,000, and the plastic needed to print a gun would cost around $50. Hobby versions of computer numerical control milling machines, meanwhile, could cost around $2,000, said Free, whose company manufacturers a variety of products with 3D printing and CNC machining. But someone also could access these printers and CNC milling machines through a monthly membership -- perhaps $100 or more -- at a makers' collective that already owns them, Free said. Free said people wanting to use these methods to make a gun generally would need a mechanical background with decent technology skills. ""It's not plug-and-play,"" he said. Still, ""if you're curious and somewhat intelligent, you'll figure it out."" New York: Release of plans is 'reckless' New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also announced a series of actions Tuesday to prevent the distribution of the 3D-printable gun designs. Cuomo issued a cease-and-desist letter to Defense Distributed to block the distribution of designs for 3D-printed guns in New York. The governor called the impending release ""reckless."" Cuomo directed state police to issue a notice reminding New Yorkers that manufacturing firearms defined as assault weapons is illegal in New York. JUST WATCHED Parkland victim's dad slams 3D-printed guns Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Parkland victim's dad slams 3D-printed guns 01:01 ""As the nation rises up and calls for action against gun violence, it is absurd and frightening that the federal government wants to make accessing an automatic weapon as easy as hitting print,"" he said. ""New York is proud to have the strongest gun safety laws in the nation, and we won't let this federal government take us backwards."" Cuomo said he will pursue legislation to bolster the state's gun safety laws and outlaw private production of all 3D-printed and ""ghost guns"" that are untraceable and invisible to metal detectors. Cuomo's actions came after Pennsylvania went to court Sunday to block early distribution of the plans, which weren't supposed to be available for download until Wednesday. But more than 1,000 designs were downloaded recently in advance of the agreed-upon August 1 date. At the hearing, Defense Distributed agreed to block Pennsylvania IP addresses for a few days until a more formal hearing could be held. Blackman, the Defense Distributed lawyer, told CNN on Monday the Pennsylvania case was about free speech rights, not the manufacture of guns. ""One state cannot censor the speech of a citizen in another state,"" he said. 'We know this fight is not yet over' The National Rifle Association said Tuesday that undetectable guns already are illegal. ""Many antigun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3D-printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms,"" said Chris Cox, the NRA's executive director for legislative action. ""Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years. Federal law passed in 1988, crafted with the NRA's support, makes it unlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer or receive an undetectable firearm."" The statement came after President Donald Trump expressed skepticism over the ability to download plans for 3D-printed guns legally, saying in a tweet that he's spoken with the NRA about them because the technology ""doesn't seem to make much sense!"" The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence applauded the decision temporarily blocking the 3D-printed guns. ""It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that 3D-printed guns are nothing short of a menace to society, and we are thrilled that the court ruled in this manner,"" Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign, said in a statement. ""The efforts of these attorneys general throughout the nation have helped strike a powerful blow against the scourge of 3D-printed guns, but we know this fight is not yet over. We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one.""",3D printed firearms Gun Defense Distributed 3D printing Liberator Firearm United States Ghost gun Printing,A 3-D printed gun that was used to be used to make a 3D-print gun.,"(CNN) A federal judge Tuesday night ruled it is illegal to post blueprints for 3D-printable guns online, but hundreds of designs reportedly were downloaded before the judge's decision, meaning those designs are out there -- legally or not.

An archived, verified account in Bowers’ name on social media site Gab included countless anti-Semitic posts. The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society “likes to bring invaders in that kill our people,” the account posted on Saturday morning just before the shooting: “I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered.

Mr Bowers, who wrote frequent racist online screeds denouncing Jewish people, is to appear in federal court on Monday, to face several dozen charges. He also faces 11 counts of murder, brought by state authorities. US Attorney Scott Brady said federal prosecutors are seeking approval to pursue the death penalty against Mr Bowers. The 46-year-old suspect was shot by officers and taken into custody after police responded to reports of an attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighbourhood on Saturday morning. He is being treated at the Allegheny General Hospital. On Sunday evening, Jeff Cohen, a member of Tree of Life synagogue and president of Allegheny General Hospital, described how he heard the gunshots break out on Saturday morning. He also revealed he had spoken to the alleged gunman. “I went to see the shooter and the cops that were guarding him. You look at him, I wanted to try and understand why did he do this,” he told CNN. “And I have no answers. I asked him how are you feeling, and he was sort of groggy and said I’m feeling okay. And I introduced myself as Dr Cohen, the president of Allegheny General. And I left. The FBI agent in charge looked at me and says I don’t know how you did that because I’m not sure I could have.” Mr Cohen said he believed it was “time for leaders to lead”. Since the attack on Saturday morning there has been intense debate in the US about whether Donald Trump’s rhetoric has helped create an environment where such incidents are more likely. Mr Cohen said: “The gentleman didn’t appear to be a member of the Mensa society. He listens to the noise, he hears the noise. The noise was telling him his people were being slaughtered. He thought it was time to rise up and do something. He’s completely confused, and the words mean things. The words are leading to people doing things like this.” Story continues Video: Trump and First Lady Visit Pittsburgh in Wake of Shooting Following the shooting, Mr Trump condemned the act of violence as an “antisemitic act” and “pure evil”. “There must be no tolerance for antisemitism in America or for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice,” he added. Critics said the president’s language, frequently aggressive and mocking of people who disagreed with him, was helping create an environment in which such acts were more likely. “This president’s modus operandi is to divide us,” Democratic congressman Adam Schiff told CNN. “It’s not enough that a day on a tragedy he says the right words, if every other day of the year he’s saying things to bring us into conflict with one another.” Supporters of the president, who on Friday had denied his words or actions had inspired accused mail bomber Cesar Sayoc, were quick to dismiss any link between Mr Trump’s language and the gun attack in Pittsburgh, whose alleged perpetrator reportedly wrote disparaging comments about the president on social media and said he was a “globalist, not a nationalist”. The word globalist is often used a slur by antisemites. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, told Fox News the president “has made it extraordinarily clear that we will never allow political violence to take root in this country”.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. PITTSBURGH — The streets of Squirrel Hill, slick with rain and fallen leaves, felt eerily quiet on Sunday morning as Elias Aizenman, 59, walked his dog, Leo. One day earlier, just blocks from Aizenman's home here, a gunman entered the Tree of Life synagogue and killed three women and eight men before being taken into custody by police. Tree of Life is where Aizenman's daughter had her bat mitzvah ceremony, and it's at the heart of this historically Jewish community, which is home to University of Pittsburgh faculty members and a judge. Still, he said he wasn't shocked to learn that a shooting had happened. ""It didn't take me by surprise,"" Aizenman said. ""I sort of was expecting something like this. I just wasn't expecting it here just because of the nature of the community."" As Aizenman walked Leo past signs that read in English, Arabic and Spanish, ""No matter where you are from, we're glad you're our neighbor,"" the Allegheny County medical examiner publicly read aloud the names of the congregation members who were killed Saturday. Two brothers and a married couple were among those fatally shot after authorities say Robert Bowers went on a rampage during a weekly service on Saturday. The 11 victims were 54 to 97 years old, authorities said at a news conference. Dr. Karl Williams, the chief medical examiner, said autopsies had begun, but he wouldn't give a time frame on how long they would take to complete. Federal charges released Saturday night said Bowers, who was being treated for gunshot wounds at a hospital, took four firearms into the synagogue: three Glock handguns and semi-automatic rifle. Authorities said he used all four weapons. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha At Waffalonia, a waffle restaurant in Squirrel Hill, Cody Murphy, 17, who helped organize a vigil on Saturday, was thinking of Jewish holidays to come. ""On Hanukkah, we're all going to be thinking about it and, on Passover, we're all going to be thinking about it,"" she said. ""It's never going to go away, and a lot of kids in this community are going to be scared to go to services."" Adults in the community, where Fred Rogers of ""Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood"" once lived, also echoed the fear of returning to synagogues in the community. ""What are we going to do when we go to synagogue next? That fear ripples through your mind,"" said Dennis Jett, 73, a former U.S. ambassador to Peru and Mozambique who has lived in this neighborhood for six years. Jett likened the feeling in the community to the atmosphere after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ""I know what that feels like, and the idea that that feeling could be here in this neighborhood is unthinkable,"" he said. On most Sundays in Squirrel Hill, people watch football and root for the Steelers, Aizenman said. But this Sunday was different. ""I guess people are staying home,"" he said. Officials said that Bowers is believed to have acted alone and that there was no additional threat. ""He will be held fully accountable,"" U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said at the news conference. Authorities said Sunday that they were treating the attack as a hate crime and that Bowers had mentioned his hatred for Jews. FBI Special Agent Robert Jones said it remained unclear why the gunman chose the Tree of Life synagogue and whether he had scoped out the premises before launching his attack. Jones said Bowers appeared to be trying to leave when officers arrived on Saturday. He added that if Bowers had made it out of the synagogue, there was a strong possibility there would have been more violence. Jones said he expected the crime scene investigation to take as long as a week to process. Jeff Finkelstein, chief executive of the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said three congregations hold services at the synagogue, but he couldn't say how many were meeting on Saturday.

""Tonight, let's celebrate their lives. Let the music unite us with love in their enduring memory,"" he said before leading the audience of the Nashville, Tennessee ceremony in a moment of silence.

Last week's mass shooting involving country music fans came just one year after a gunman rained bullets on a Las Vegas country music festival, killing 58 people in one of the deadliest gun massacres in modern US history. Several survivors of last year's tragedy were also in the California bar. Country music is often associated with conservative-leaning Americans and guns are often a theme of its songs. The 2017 edition of the awards -- which fell weeks after the Vegas shooting -- saw the CMAs come under fire for urging reporters covering the show to steer clear of political topics, including gun rights. Following the moment of silence this year the evening took on a more jovial tone, with Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood -- who hosted the evening for the 11th consecutive year -- cracking jokes on lighthearted topics including Lady Gaga and Underwood's pregnancy. Keith Urban, who is married to Hollywood superstar Nicole Kidman, nabbed the top Entertainer of the Year prize at the show, which is one of two major award ceremonies in the industry.

What did the sheriff say? On Thursday, New York Times Miami bureau chief Patricia Mazzei tweeted that Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri had said that someone with a gun on the campus of the school could have taken advantage of killer Nikolas Cruz needing to reload his gun to “mitigate” the severity of the massacre. Sheriff Bob Gualtieri of Pinellas County, head of Florida's state-appointed commission investigating the Parkland shooting, said today that video from inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School showed the gunman, Nikolas Cruz, had to reload his AR-15 assault rifle several times. — Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) August 9, 2018 ""If he had somebody in there with a gun, they could have mitigated this,"" the sheriff said. ""There were opportunities for staff to have intervened if they had been armed."" — Patricia Mazzei (@PatriciaMazzei) August 9, 2018 Gualtieri made the comments during a meeting of members of the safety commission. While some advocates have argued that the solution to this problem could be arming school teachers, Gualtieri seems to have been talking about arming the security guards themselves. While there were eight security guards at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, only one of them was armed. The high school enrolled roughly 3,100 students during the 2015-16 school year, in a campus that included 13 buildings on 45 acres. This single armed guard was later fired and branded as a disgrace for failing to take action to stop Cruz. Two additional, unarmed guards were also fired for hiding and not enacting the high school's lockdown protocol. “One armed law enforcement officer on a campus of 2,300 kids ... is 'feel-good,'” Gualtieri said, according to TCPalm.com. “It barely checks the box. And that is not effective.” Gualtieri noted that police were not even dispatched until two minutes after Cruz was in the building. At the same meeting, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement gave a presentation that showed that school employees were the first responders in 33 percent of all campus shootings. What else? Other school districts in Florida have already been increasing the number of armed guards on campus. At least 25 of Florida's 67 school districts have approved plans to hire trained guards from the Guardians or similar programs. These programs train average citizens who agree to guard schools for a fraction of the price of traditional security guards. Some counties are paying off-duty deputies to guard their schools. However, at least 40 of Florida's counties have opted against arming any additional staffers beyond these security guards and deputies.",United Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Parkland    Shooting Army officer Police Military,"Sheriff Bob Gual Tieri of Pinellas County, Fla., in November.","The Florida sheriff, in charge of a state commission investigating the circumstances surrounding the mass murder at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, said that someone else at the school with a gun could have prevented some of the deaths.

Some of the 17 victims killed on February 14, including Coach Aaron Feis , lived in his neighborhood. Knudson felt devastated by the tragedy striking his hometown and needed a way to express his grief. Creating a sculpture to commemorate those who lost their lives seemed like the natural solution. Within a few days, he completed the design: A metal and impact glass installation, standing approximately 17 feet tall and punctuated by fragments of colorful laminate. The names of the ""17 angels,"" as Knudson calls them, will be boldly listed on one side.

Hedge fund legend Stanley Druckenmiller, who now runs family-office Duquesne Capital, argues that President Donald Trump became destructive “once he figured out how powerful a weapon the U.S. banking system was and how powerful sanctions are.” In a 90-minute interview with Kiril Sokoloff on Real Vision Television, Druckenmiller acknowledged that “this weapon” should be used only “once in a while.” “But when you start just shooting it all over the place — and you’re now shooting it at Canada, at Europe, here or there — that’s a lot different than shooting at Iran or Russia,” he said, “He’s like a little kid that found this water gun, and he’s just running around going all over the place with it.” According to Druckenmiller, the “biggest danger” is that global trust in America is eroded. “I don’t think it can be lost in four years. I really don’t,” he said. “But if Trump is re-elected — or maybe even worse, if another populist on the very hard left is re-elected — and they use the weapon the same way, I think by [2024] — which by the way, is exactly when the entitlement thing will start to get crazy — this thing could be very bad.” But Druckenmiller hasn’t yet surrendered to the worst case scenario. “Let’s see who the Democrats put up,” he said. “Let’s see if Trump’s in office. But I don’t think the world will give up on us in four years. I’m open minded to Trump having been a one-off and the trade system can survive this.” Druckenmiller isn’t, however, overly optimistic. “It’s not like that’s an 80% probability,” he added. “It’s probably somewhere between 40 and 55 that it works out. It’s sad.” Julia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter. — Julia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter.
