""We want to continue in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,"" Anne Finucane, vice chairman of Bank of America (BAC), said in an interview. ""It is our intention not to finance these military-style firearms for civilian use."" Finucane said the bank does ""have a few manufacturers of military-style firearms."" ""We're in discussion with them. We have let them know that it's not our intent to underwrite or finance military-style firearms on a go-forward basis,"" she said. Finucane was referring to the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles produced by gun companies like Remington Outdoor Company. Remington made the Bushmaster used in a 2012 mass shooting that killed 26 children and educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Bank of America is listed as a creditor in Remington's Chapter 11 filing. A spokesman for Bank of America would not confirm or deny reports to CNNMoney that the bank also lends to Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Vista Outdoor (VSTO), which also make AR-15-style rifles. Remington, Ruger and Vista did not return messages from CNNMoney. Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group, applauded the move. ""When the second-largest bank in the US takes concrete steps to prevent gun violence, it sends a clear message to the entire industry: It's time for every financial institution to do their part,"" said Everytown president John Feinblatt, in a statement. But the gun industry group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, objected to Bank of America's characterization of the guns as ""military"" since they're products for civilians. ""We as an industry would welcome the opportunity to sit down with Bank of America executives to explain our industry's perspective and to discuss what really would work to keep firearms out of the hands of those who should not have them,"" said NSSF spokesman Michael Bazinet, in a statement. Related: Why the AR-15 is the mass shooter's go-to weapon In February, Bank of America said it plans to ""engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility."" This is a rising trend on Wall Street, which is losing its taste for gun manufacturers ever since a mass shooting in February, when a AR-15-style Smith & Wesson rifle made by American Outdoor Brands was used to kill 17 students and educators at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Last month, Citigroup (C)said it will bar companies that it does business with from selling guns to people under the age of 21 and require customers to undergo background checks for all firearm purchases. Money manger BlackRock, (BLK) the largest shareholder in both Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, said last month that it will start offering clients the option to invest in funds that exclude firearms and retailers that sell them. State Street (STT), a top shareholder in Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor, has said that it's contacted the companies to see how they ""will support the safe and responsible use of their products."" Blackstone, another investment firm, reached out to a dozen hedge fund managers asking for information about their stakes in gun manufacturers and distributors. Related: Remington, one of the oldest gun makers in America, files Chapter 11 Bank of America's Finucane stopped short of saying the bank was going to stop lending to gun retailers any time soon, saying that ""gets into civil liberties and Second Amendment."" Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) Chief Executive Officer Edward Stack said in February, days after the Parkland shooting, that his stores would stop selling ""assault-type rifles"" and high capacity magazines, and won't sell any gun to anyone under 21. Walmart (WMT), which stopped selling military-style semiautomatic rifles in 2015, also recently raised its gun buying age to 21, along with L.L. Bean and the grocery chain Kroger (KR), which sells guns through its Fred Meyer stores.

Interim police commissioner Gary Tuggle called the spate of recent shootings — more than a dozen in 48 hours — ""totally unacceptable."" Tuggle said Wednesday many of the shootings are linked and said the ""common denominator"" is the demand for drugs. 11 people were shot Tuesday, three fatally, reports CBS Baltimore. Two more people were shot Wednesday, including one who died. There have been 44 murders in the past 30 days, six of them in the past week, the station reports.

He said the additional 230 officers on Wednesday brought the total number of officers on the street to 650. Tuggle said he has temporarily suspended administrative functions at police headquarters and each of the police precincts to account for the shift. ""There are going to be a number of things that don't get done, but right now, patrol is our priority. Addressing crime is a priority,"" Tuggle said. Mayor Catherine Pugh called the increase in patrols a short-term solution to a long-term problem of a police shortage. ""It's all hands on deck, but the issue still remains that we need additional police officers in our city,"" Pugh said. The uptick of violence in October came on the heels of a violent September, which was the deadliest month in over a year in the city, according to the Washington Post.

It's about Trump & GOP gutting Medicaid: Kennedy,"Joe Kennedy III “A mental health problem at the highest level,” President Trump said after a shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas left 26 parishioners dead. “Mental health is often a big problem underlying these tragedies,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said after a gunman killed 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. If Republican leaders are talking about mental health, it’s generally for one reason — to avoid talking about guns. By any measure, the claim that mental illness is to blame for gun violence is false. The United States does not have a disproportionate number of people suffering from mental illness, but we do have a disproportionate number of guns, mass shooters and deaths by firearm. Only 3% to 5% of violent crimes are committed by mentally ill people, and they themselves are roughly 10 times more likely to be the victims of violencethan the general population. Still, Trump and Ryan are right that we have a mental health crisis in this country. What they don’t mention is that it's driven by the Republican Party’s systemic erosion of health care and coverage. Specifically, their efforts to decimate the single largest source of funding for mental health and substance use disorder treatment in the United States — Medicaid. More:What if Dems were in charge? I'd let people buy Medicaid coverage: Senator More:On Medicaid work requirements, who will judge the character judges? Medicaid covers 75 million Americans, 50 million of them children, elderly or disabled. For those with mental illness or a substance use disorder, Medicaid is often a lifeline to treatment they otherwise would go without. Today, in the midst of a devastating opioid epidemic, it covers nearly 40% of non-elderly adults with an opioid addiction and 26% with a serious mental illness. Put another way, you can’t champion mental health reform or opioid treatment with one hand and aim to gut Medicaid with the other. Nonetheless, Trump and the GOP have spent the last 15 months working to do just that. First, it was their ill-fated effort to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act, which would have cut Medicaid by more than $800 billion, ended the ACA’s Medicaid expansion and imposed arbitrary caps on benefits for people left in the program. The American public rejected their plan. But the administration, undeterred, proposes to cut the program by $800 billion in its latest budget. And Trump and his team have brought their vendetta against Medicaid to the states, giving local officials and administrators unprecedented authority to limit coverage and benefits. Last month, states like Kentucky, Indiana and Arkansas got a green light to cut Medicaid access for people who lose their jobs and restrict the ability of families to keep the health care they need to get back on their feet. States like Ohio tell us this is a deeply flawed approach; having Medicaid coverage makes people more likely to work. For most Americans, this is common sense. It is exceedingly difficult to find or keep a job when you cannot meet basic health care needs for yourself or your family. Which explains why today nearly 80% of adults on Medicaid live in a family where someone is employed, 60% work themselves and the vast majority of those not working are in school, caring for a loved one, or facing serious physical or mental illness that makes work difficult if not impossible. When you hear the Republican talking point that these reforms are intended only for folks who make too much money to “deserve” assistance, look at Alabama. Its proposed work requirement would apply to parents and caretakers living below 18% of the poverty line; or less than $4,524 for a family of four for an entire year. More:New Trump rules will drive people with disabilities off Medicaid and out of work More:As state voters lead on Medicaid, could health care be the next gay marriage? POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Many of these families will lose coverage not because they refuse to work but because they are unable to comply with the onerous bureaucratic demands that come with work requirements. Furthermore, the Trump administration is not allowing states to use Medicaid funds for things like job training, child care and transportation that would help people find work again. These challenges will hit the mental health community in particular. Mental illness is chronic and stigma often compounds the difficulty of navigating a job — stigma that is carelessly reinforced every time a Republican elected official blames the mentally ill for causing this country’s gun violence epidemic. Tragically, work requirements are just one of the ways this administration is targeting our mental health infrastructure. States like Arizona and Wisconsin have asked for federal lifetime limits on Medicaid beneficiaries that the government deems “able-bodied,” a move that puts government officials in the business of making medical decisions and deciding the merit of our health challenges. States like Kansas have proposed ending Medicaid coverage after as little as 36 months. As anyone with depression or a substance use disorder (not to mention cancer or heart disease or diabetes) would tell you, healing seldom complies with a three-year deadline. “We’ve been dreaming about this since … you and I were drinking at a keg,” Ryan mused to a fellow conservative last year about capping Medicaid spending. For the sick and suffering among us, Medicaid is survival. The next time we see GOP leaders excuse their inaction on gun violence by scapegoating those with mental illness, let’s take a cue from the brave student survivors in Parkland and call BS. Rep.

A clerk for the Columbus County Court in North Carolina confirms that Griffith filed a motion to modify custody on July 24 — one day after Teen Mom 2aired footage of an April incident in which Evans pulled a gun on another driver for allegedly tailgating her on the highway while her 8-year-old son Jace was in the car. (The Ashley was the first to report the news of the motion.) In the motion, Griffith alleges that Evans’ husband David Eason is a “violent person who is a danger to the minor child.” Griffith also alleges that both Evans and Eason “have have drug dependency and substance abuse issues,” claiming that “the minor child in question, as well as another of the plaintiff’s children, did test positive for THC at birth.” (Evans has previously admitted to testing positive for THC, the chemical found in cannabis, after giving birth to daughter Ensley last year, though she said her daughter did not test positive.) The motion alleges that Evans “has been rehab two to three times but has never completed treatment” and “is frequently in criminal trouble, being arrested in excess of 20 times.” Griffith is seeking full legal and physical custody of Kaiser, with Evans getting secondary custody in the form of visitation. “The above constitutes a substantial change in circumstances affecting the welfare of the minor child, such that the court should modify the prior orders and award the defendant with primary care, custody and control of the minor child subject to visitation with the plaintiff,” states the motion. Eason and Evans did not respond to PEOPLE’s request for comment. Jenelle Evans and Nathan Griffith Jenelle Evans and David Eason Last week, Griffith told TMZ he thinks the footage of Evans’ road rage incident will help him gain custody over Kaiser “because it shows an unstable environment” and “a very hectic situation.” “I think it shows that the child might be in danger being in a hostile situation like that,” he said, arguing that Evans is “not making sound judgment to keep the children safe.” Story continues “Overall, I provide a stable and peaceful environment and even footage shows that I’m constantly trying to take Kaiser out of a hostile situation,” he said. “I am afraid that if she carries a loaded weapon inside a vehicle and she keeps it that accessible, without a lock on it — that’s very dangerous to be around children.” The other driver involved in the incident, Robert Robinson Jr., told TMZ that Evans was lucky to be alive, claiming he alerted his neighbors when he saw her coming towards his house, and they were all allegedly armed. He told the outlet he also keeps a gun in his truck — which he claimed he only pulls out to protect himself — but he didn’t take it out once he saw Evans’ son in the car with her. Neither driver was charged in connection with the incident. Teen Mom 2 airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.

""I think he's just entertaining both sides,"" said Loesch, after CNN anchor Anderson Cooper asked her multiple times if her organization felt betrayed by the President's remarks in a freewheeling meeting with a bipartisan group of lawmakers at the White House Wednesday. ""I think he's listening to see what both sides have to say."" ""Right now it seems like they're just in the discussion phase, which is good,"" she added later in the conversation. ""I would hope that they would be talking to everyone and really hearing what the voters have to say."" The chaotic meeting on Wednesday -- which multiple lawmakers recalled with bewilderment -- saw Trump break with his party on key issues and take positions, like a suggestion to take people's guns away before a judge has a chance to weigh in, that his administration and Republicans on Capitol Hill had never proposed.

FedEx said it has been quietly notifying customers of the changes by mail since early October. Why is the program ending?

97,97,131,https://www.yahoo.com/news/dispute-over-3d-printed-guns-223738462.html,Dispute over 3D-printed guns raises many legal issues,"A little-known dispute over 3D-printed guns has morphed into a national legal debate in the last week, drawing attention to a technology that seems a bit of sci-fi fantasy and — to gun-control advocates — a dangerous way for criminals to get their hands on firearms that are easy to conceal and tough to detect. The gun industry calls the outcry an overreaction that preys on unwarranted fears about a firearm that can barely shoot a round or two without disintegrating. It also raises a host of constitutional questions involving First Amendment protections for free speech and Second Amendment rights to own guns. Here are some questions and answers about the debate: Q. What is behind the dispute? A. Cody Wilson, the founder of Texas-based Defense Distributed, first posted downloadable blueprints for a handgun called the Liberator that could be made using a 3D printer in 2013. Within days it had been downloaded about 100,000 times until the State Department ordered him to cease, contending it violated federal export laws since some of the blueprints were saved by people outside the United States. The dispute between Wilson and the federal government went on for years until this past June when they reached a settlement that paved the way for Wilson to resume posting the designs. The State Department decision came amid an obscure administrative change — begun under the Obama administration — in how the weapons are regulated and administered. Military grade weapons remain under the purview of the State Department, while commercially available firearms fall under the Commerce Department. The settlement with Wilson determined that 3D-printed firearms are akin to more traditional firearms that aren't subject to State Department regulations. Wilson resumed sharing his blueprints for the gun the day the settlement went into effect last week. Q. Why does Wilson want the authority to post the designs on his website? A. Wilson calls it a First Amendment issue. He believes the First Amendment gives him a constitutional right to disseminate the code to make a gun with a 3D printer. Story continues ""This is a very, very, very easy First Amendment question that I think people might be hesitant to accept because it involves guns and people don't like guns,"" said his lawyer, Josh Blackman. And Wilson has a strong legal claim that distribution of the information is different than actually making an all-plastic firearm. While it is a violation of the federal Undetectable Firearms Act to make, sell or possess a firearm that can't be detected by magnetometers or metal detectors, what Wilson is doing is simply providing the information on how to make such a firearm. ""What Defense Distributed was doing was not making and then shipping the weapons overseas,"" said Chuck James, a former federal prosecutor who is now a private lawyer with the Washington, D.C.-area firm of Williams Mullen. ""They were making the data available on the Web where it would be available to someone overseas."" Q. What kind of gun designs are available on the website? A. Defense Distributed shows a variety of designs. The code for a 3D printed gun is for what he calls the Liberator, which gets its name from a pistol American forces used during World War II. His design includes a metal firing pin and a metal block. His site also includes blueprints to make various AR-platform long guns and some other handguns using more traditional means and materials. Q. Are 3D printed guns legal? A. In 1988, the U.S. enacted the Undetectable Firearms Act, making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or possess a firearm that couldn't be detected by a metal detector. That law has been renewed several times by Congress and remains in effect. If 3D printed guns contain enough metal to be flagged by a metal detector, they are considered legal under U.S. law. Gun-control advocates argue that the risks are too great to allow 3D printed guns because even if they're designed to include metal, it's too easy for someone to not include those pieces or to remove them to skirt detection. ""It's an absurdity. You can take the piece of metal out and put it back in at your own whims and you can take it out and walk through a metal detector undetected,"" said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety. Q. How well do 3D printed guns work? A. Gun experts and enthusiasts recoil at the suggestion that a 3D printed gun is a true threat, calling the firearms mere novelties. Unlike traditional firearms that can fire thousands of rounds in their lifetime, 3D-printed guns are notorious for usually lasting only a few rounds before they fall apart. They don't have magazines that allow the usual nine or 15 rounds to be carried; instead, they usually hold a bullet or two and then must be manually loaded afterward. And they're not usually very accurate either. A video posted of a test by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2013 showed one of the guns produced from Wilson's design — the Liberator — disintegrating into pieces after a single round was fired. ""People have got this Star Trek view"" of the guns being futuristic marvels, said Chris Knox, communications director for The Firearms Coalition, a gun-rights group. ""We're not talking about exotic technology."" Others are quick to point out that normal guns are readily available in the U.S. with little regulation, making 3D-printed guns a major hassle compared with regular weapons. Q. What's the status of the debate? A. A federal judge on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order blocking Wilson from continuing to post the designs on his site. A hearing is to be held in that case next week. In the meantime, President Donald Trump criticized the Department of Justice advising the State Department to reach a settlement with Wilson without first consulting with him.

The October shooting at a Las Vegas country music festival and the Parkland, Fla., high school shooting in February are not only expected to generate some of the biggest protests ever at the meeting — but they have so changed the political calculus that even Wall Street is taking action. A group of retailers, major banks, money managers and others are spearheading a campaign for tighter gun-control restrictions in the absence of movement by Congress. “This is an issue that’s not going away,” said Dick’s Sporting Goods Chief Executive Edward Stack, among the most outspoken private-sector advocates for changes in gun laws. “We needed to take a stand.” Advertisement Dick’s, one of the nation’s largest sporting good chains, banned gun sales to customers under 21 at its 800 Dick’s stores and 35 Field & Stream outlets — and stopped selling assault-style weapons at the Field & Stream stores — following the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 people. The tragedy followed by just four months the Oct. 1 shooting in Nevada that killed 58 and injured hundreds more. Two other huge retailers, Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co., followed Dick’s move in curbing gun sales, including banning sales to customers under 21. While it’s commonplace for businesses, pension funds and activist shareholders to take up social causes, such as the environment and diversity, the widening effort by companies and Wall Street to restrict firearms sales — and to urge Congress to take legislative steps — is a rare instance of the private sector helping steer a social movement and not waiting for Washington to act. Advertisement The effort by Dick’s and other private firms is not unlike earlier, concerted investor campaigns against tobacco companies and apartheid in South Africa, in which “people were taking those stocks out of their portfolios and putting pressure on companies,” said Nell Minow, vice chairwoman of ValueEdge Advisors, which promotes strong corporate governance. “Investors were on it before the states’ attorneys general and the regulators were on it,” she said. In the gun-control movement, too, the private sector “is a leading indicator that the mood of the country is changing,” Minow said. More than a dozen companies also ended their discount programs with the National Rifle Assn. immediately after the Florida high school shooting to distance themselves from the gun lobby. The NRA called the response “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice.” These are the companies that have cut ties with the NRA » Advertisement “We’re surprised that so many have” followed Dick’s lead “and the stances they’ve taken, and we’re very happy that they did,” said Stack, himself a gun owner, in an interview. The company already had ended sales of assault-style weapons at Dick’s stores after the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, in which 26 people, including 20 first-graders, were killed. Another leading Wall Street company, banking giant Citigroup Inc., said it would place restrictions on firearms sales for its new retail business clients, including that they don’t sell guns to someone who hasn’t passed a background check and is under 21. As for the bank’s existing business customers, Citigroup hopes “they will adopt these best practices over the coming months” but if they don’t, the bank will “work with them to transition their business away from Citi,” Chief Executive Michael Corbat said in a memo to his employees. Advertisement Corbat, like Stack, noted his own gun ownership, adding that he is “an avid outdoorsman and responsible gun owner.” Bank of America Corp., meanwhile, stopped lending to manufacturers of military-style weapons that are available to consumers. “We want to contribute in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,” Anne Finucane, a Bank of America vice chairman who leads the bank’s environmental, social and governance efforts, recently said on Bloomberg Television. “It is not our intent to underwrite or finance military-style firearms on a go-forward basis.” A dozen U.S. senators, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), this week called on other major banks to follow suit, saying “there is a growing consensus in the private sector that companies can and should take action to address the problem of gun violence in our country.” Advertisement Dick’s also is destroying the assault-style weapons it has banned from its Field & Stream stores. That is not because the chain was concerned the guns might eventually be traced back to Dick’s, but because “our preference would be that these guns are not in the marketplace,” Stack said. “If we sold these guns to someone else, then they would be in the marketplace and we felt that would be hypocritical,” he said. The chain also has retained a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm to work with Congress and push for legislation, Bloomberg reported. Indeed, the politics have changed so much on the issue that even Trump — who last year thanked the NRA at its convention for supporting his presidential campaign — has recently publicly stated that legislators should not be afraid to defy the group in reaching a comprehensive gun-control package. Advertisement Edward Stack, chief executive of Dick’s Sporting Goods, visits a new store at the Baybrook Mall in Houston in October 2016. (Scott Dalton / Invision/AP ) But the private-sector actions also are emblematic of the hotly debated and divisive gun-control issue itself: Even though the companies generally seek the same result, their campaigns in some cases have caused crosscurrents for the firms. For instance, BlackRock Inc., the nation’s largest money manager with $6.3 trillion of assets under management, is one of the largest investors in gun-related companies. It plans to remove the stocks of Dick’s, Walmart and other retailers from some of its existing and planned investment funds because, despite the retailers’ gun-control efforts, the retailers still sell firearms. “We believe that this [Parkland] event requires response and action,” BlackRock said last month. Advertisement BlackRock is led by Chief Executive Larry Fink, a longtime advocate of social responsibility by corporate America and Wall Street. In his annual letter to CEOs this year, Fink wrote that every company “must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” BlackRock will still hold positions in gun makers or sellers that are part of exchange-traded funds that replicate stock indexes if customers want those ETFs, but BlackRock’s funds that exclude firearms-related firms give investors an option. “It is ultimately our clients’ choice about the types of funds they invest in,” the money manager said. Asked whether BlackRock’s move to strip Dick’s and other retailers from certain funds penalized his company despite Dick’s own gun-control efforts, Stack said “every company, whether it’s a retailer, a services company or a financial-based company — they’ve got to do what they feel is right for their management and their investors.” “Clearly BlackRock must have felt that was in their best interest,” Stack said. “I’m not going to comment more than that.” Advertisement But then BlackRock found itself criticized by David Hogg, a Parkland student who became a leading public figure in the groundswell of student gun-control activism after the shooting. In a recent Twitter post, Hogg urged a boycott of BlackRock and Vanguard Group, another major money manager, because they are “two of the biggest investors in gun manufacturers.” Regardless, companies and Wall Street “are going to keep leading the charge to change policy” in the gun-control effort because “I see it spreading” among private firms nationwide, said Gonzalo Freixes, an adjunct professor of accounting at UCLA’s Anderson School of Management who’s been tracking the issue. “They will take a stand and try to effectuate government policy,” Friexes said of the companies. Advertisement Indeed, Stack said legislative change is unlikely soon, so the private sector will have to keep pressing the issue. “We spent a lot of time in Washington over the last several weeks, and we’ve talked to a number of people in Congress,” Stack said. “It doesn’t seem, at least in this Congress, that there’s going to be a solution.” In the meantime, the private-sector push is “a groundswell in the country today that is not going to stop,” Stack said. “The private sector should lead. But Congress should act.” james.peltz@latimes.com Advertisement Twitter: @PeltzLATimes UPDATES: 3:30 p.m. May 3: This article was updated with information about President Trump’s speech before the NRA, Dick’s decision to hire a lobbyist and a call by U.S. senators for more financial institutions to take steps to help tighten gun ownership rules.

Last month, the duo won a major victory for gun rights when an appeals court found Hawaii's restrictive handgun law unconstitutional, a ruling that could lead to a landmark decision from the U.S. Supreme Court on the right to bear arms in public. And they did so without the help of the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. ""I went around the state of Hawaii and contacted about 17 attorneys and all of them turned me down. They said I would only lose,"" said Young, 68. ""I want to see it through to the end, which is the U.S. Supreme Court."" U.S gun-control advocates favor strict laws like Hawaii's, blaming lax gun laws for excessive gun violence and deadly mass shootings in the United States. The NRA and other gun-rights advocates oppose laws that restrict the constitutional right to bear arms and want the high court to take up a new case, hoping it will expand gun rights outside the home. The Supreme Court has not taken on a major gun-rights case since a pair of cases in 2008 and 2010 in which the court established that the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep a gun at home. Hawaii allows only people who work in security or who can demonstrate to law enforcement officials that they have an ""exceptional case"" to carry weapons, concealed or openly. After he left the Army, Young carried a firearm for 17 years as an airport security guard but lost that right after he retired. He failed to convince the County of Hawaii's police chief he deserved a permit, so he sued, saying his constitutional right to bear arms was violated. He filed suits in 2008, 2010 and 2012 to challenge the denials, losing each time. Lacking the means to hire a lawyer for an appeal, Young would normally have had to depend on a star litigator financed by the NRA or a major law firm to take the case pro bono, or free of cost. Story continues Instead Young paired up with Beck, a solo practitioner who learned of Young's story and offered to represent him for free. Beck said he has limited means of his own and that his father has offered to lend him money if needed to keep the case going. ""This covers my pro bono hours for my career. It's worth it. Sometimes you have to do the right thing,"" Beck said. NO NRA HELP Based in California but with family ties in Hawaii, Beck said he took Young's case because he disagreed with the ruling by the U.S. District Court and said Young was denied the leeway that should be afforded to a non-lawyer representing himself. ""I didn't think he got a fair shake,"" Beck said. ""We got to know each other very well. I know his family now. I consider him a good friend as well as a client."" The NRA turned down a request to help with the case, Beck said, declining to elaborate. The NRA was still involved in assisting another lawsuit challenging carry laws when Young filed his suit, which is why the association did not get involved, spokeswoman Amy Hunter said. On July 24, Young scored his first victory. In a 2-1 ruling, a three-judge panel of the normally liberal 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/07/24/12-17808.pdf Young has a Second Amendment right to carry a firearm in public. The NRA applauded the ruling. Hawaii has until Sept. 14 to ask the case to be reheard by the same panel or ""en banc"" by a larger number of judges. The state has defended its law by citing the 2008 and 2010 Supreme Court cases, District of Colombia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago. While those rulings were taken as a victory by gun-rights advocates, proponents of gun control say the court also established limits to the Second Amendment. ""Heller was not intended to extend the protections found in the Second Amendment to any area outside the home,"" Hawaii said in a 2013 filing in the case. 'CIRCUIT SPLIT'Some U.S. appeals courts have upheld state laws that greatly restrict gun carry rights while others have struck them down, creating what is known as ""circuit split."" The Supreme Court often hears cases in order to resolve such splits, but it requires four out of nine Supreme Court justices to agree to hear a case. ""As a practical matter, there is indeed a circuit split,"" said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor. Young, who is part native Hawaiian and part descendant of Japanese plantation workers, became passionate about the issue while teaching his late daughter Tim, who died in a car accident in 2004 at age 21, about the Constitution. ""She was my pet. Of my three children she was the one to follow me everywhere,"" Young said. One day, as they discussed the Constitution, Young was startled when she told him he could not carry a handgun in Hawaii, so he began his quest. ""I made the promise that they cannot take your Second Amendment away,"" Young said. ""So to prove it to her, that's when I started.""

950,950,110274,http://www.yahoo.com/news/southern-california-city-mourns-wake-bar-massacre-070443860.html,Official: Shooter debated sanity online during bar massacre,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- The gunman who killed 12 people at a country music bar in Southern California went on social media during the attack and posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane, a law enforcement official said Friday. Also, one of the possibilities investigators are looking into is whether gunman Ian David Long believed his former girlfriend would be at the bar, the official said. Authorities have not determined a motive for Wednesday night's rampage at the Borderline Bar and Grill. The official was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The official would not give additional details on what the 28-year-old former Marine posted on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. A second law enforcement official said that when Long was inside the bar, he apparently stopped shooting and posted to Instagram, based on the time stamps of the posts. Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian also said he didn't know the content of the posts. Neither Facebook nor Instagram responded to a request for comment Friday. Long's social media accounts have been taken down. Long, a former machine gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire with a handgun during college night at the bar, then apparently killed himself as scores of police officers closed in. As investigators worked to figure out what set him off, President Donald Trump blamed mental illness, describing the gunman as ""a very sick puppy"" who had ""a lot of problems."" Investigators have not commented on whether mental illness played a role in the rampage. But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff's deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed. Story continues Several people who knew Long a decade ago as a high-schooler in the suburb of Thousand Oaks said in interviews that he made them uncomfortable, sometimes through aggressive behavior. At the White House, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on PTSD among veterans. He declined to engage on questions on whether the nation needs stricter gun control laws. The dead in the shooting rampage included sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran gunned down as he entered the bar, and Telemachus Orfanos, 27, who survived last year's massacre in Las Vegas, where a gunman in a high-rise hotel opened killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival. Authorities in Thousand Oaks described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire, authorities said. Instead, when Long shot, he killed. ""Every Marine is trained in urban warfare and indoor gun fighting,"" said Marc Bender, an instructor for emergency responders in Riverside County, California. ""Every Marine is a marksman."" Julie Hanson, who lives next door to the Longs' ranch-style home, described him as ""odd"" and ""disrespectful"" well before he left home a decade ago, got married and enlisted in the Marines. She could often hear him yelling and cursing, but several months ago, unusually loud banging and shouting prompted her husband to call authorities. ""I was concerned because I knew he had been in the military,"" Tom Hanson said. About 18 months ago, Don and Effie MacLeod heard ""an awful argument"" and what he believes was a gunshot from the Longs' property. Don MacLeod said he did not call police but avoided speaking with Ian Long. ""I told my wife, 'Just be polite to him. If he talks, just acknowledge him, don't go into conversation with him,' "" Don MacLeod said. Long made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens. Dominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative. In one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his. ""I literally feared for myself around him,"" Colell said in an interview. ""He was the only athlete that I was scared of."" Colell said she wanted to kick Long off the team but the boy's coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines. She relented when, at the next track meet, Long apologized in front of several coaches and administrators. Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at Newbury Park High School and its school district were unsuccessful. Both were closed because of a destructive wildfire in the area. ___ Balsamo reported from Washington.

Why man says he's fighting to be allowed to post blueprints for 3-D printed guns Why man says he's fighting to be allowed to post blueprints for 3-D printed guns ABC News Cody Wilson has been called “one of the most dangerous people on the Internet.” For years, Wilson has fought to make sure anyone should be able to download the files to make a gun at home with the click of a button using a 3-D printer or a computer automated milling machine. “I’ve demonstrated ... especially these last few weeks [that] the idea of gun control in the internet age is inoperable,” Wilson told ABC News’ “Nightline.” Last week, a federal judge temporarily stopped him from putting gun blueprints online -- the latest chapter in an ongoing battle with the federal government, 19 states, the District of Columbia and gun control advocates. “If Cody Wilson is not stopped, then what we will find is a universe where the internet has plans to 3-D print any kind of weapon anybody wants, with printers that make that incredibly easy for someone to do in only a few hours in their garage or in their living room,” Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign, told “Nightline.” Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed company, holds a 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" in his factory in Austin, Texas, Aug.1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Wilson invited “Nightline” to Austin, Texas, which is the home of his company Defense Distributed. The 30-year-old said he originally wanted to be a lawyer. “I had a better idea,” Wilson said. His idea was, “Could you make WikiLeaks for guns?” In 2012, he and his friends were some of the first people to 3-D print a plastic gun, which they called “The Liberator.” They shared the blueprint file on the internet, where Wilson says it was downloaded more than 100,000 times in just the first week. That’s when the federal government jumped. The State Department argued that by posting the blueprints, Wilson was basically doing the same thing as exporting weapons abroad. Wilson took down the blueprints, and in 2015 filed a lawsuit against the State Department arguing that the digital gun blueprints are a form of free speech. Wilson says it’s both a First Amendment issue and a Second Amendment issue. “It’s both, but the way that this had to be fought for years in court was on a First Amendment claim,” Wilson said. A 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" is seen in a factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Andy Greenberg, a senior writer at WIRED, has covered Wilson and the digital DIY gun debate since 2012. “If a gun is a piece of data then are you allowed to share it and call it free speech? That is the argument that Defense Distributed has been making for the last three years,” Greenberg told “Nightline.” “All the headlines are always about 3-D printed guns. But for Defense Distributed 3-D printing is almost just like a stand-in for this idea of any kind of digital tool that allows you to with just a download and a click create a gun component at home,” said Greenberg. In a surprise turn this summer, the Trump administration reached a settlement with Wilson and Defense Distributed that would have allowed him to publish his gun blueprints online. He started publishing some of the files on July 27 but was forced again to remove them when a judge issued a temporary restraining order last week. Wilson says that his aim is less about making weapons but instead giving people the tools to make a gun. “Posting guns to the internet my goodness in these terms knowing the attorneys general will sue, nothing beats it,"" Wilson said. At his company’s Texas headquarters, Wilson showed how his company has moved beyond the 3D printing of plastic guns into making metal guns using a computer-automated milling machine. Wilson has developed a computer-automated milling machine, which is small enough to sit on a desk, and it costs just $2,000. It carves metal parts into the main component of different firearms like the AR-15 and glock. “This will take you a couple of hours, and it doesn’t require your constant intercession,” Wilson explained, while the machine milled part of an AR-15. It’s perfectly legal. Instead of publishing the computer data needed to operate the milling machine, Wilson ships it to his customers Unlike the plastic versions that sometimes malfunctioned, experts say the metal versions can be similar to what you buy at a gun store. Greenberg said the milling machine is “the most practical technology right now for homemade guns that circumvent all gun control laws and present a much more practical threat than 3-D printing.” Weapons like these have been called “ghost guns,” as they have no serial number, can be assembled at home and are virtually untraceable. “The term ghost gun refers to guns that really appear out of nowhere,"" Gardiner said. ""We don’t have any register of who bought them, how they were sold."" J.C. Cotter installs an electronic package for a Ghost Gunner milling machine at the Defense Distributed factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images But homemade guns are not new, and in many cases perfectly legal. But critics say Wilson’s machine could make it easier for these firearms to get into the hands of people who aren’t legally allowed to own guns, like felons or the mentally ill. “We have seen ghost guns used in shootings around America in the last several years,” said Gardiner. Leticia Franco still remembers the day five years ago when a gunman opened fire in Santa Monica, killing four five people, including Franco’s father and sister. “You feel so sad, like a part of you is taken away,” Franco told “Nightline.” The shooter had used a ghost gun. An investigation revealed that he had a history of mental health issues, and previously had tried to buy a gun, but was denied. The shooter instead ordered parts online, and assembled them into a gun himself. This incident was not at all connected to Wilson, but Franco says she’s afraid of what Wilson’s doing. “Providing this information is wrong. He’s also ethically responsible for what other people do with this information,” Franco said. “You provided these people with information that could potentially cause another tragedy.” Wilson says he is aware of the potential dangers of making access to ghost guns easier. “This isn’t just like playing games on your keyboard, right, on the internet? I’ve had customers arrested, right, in other states for owning guns when they shouldn’t have,” Wilson said. “But, again, [I’m advocating] that these are the necessary consequences of ensuring the people’s right to keep and bear arms.” Wilson continued, “I reserve the right to change my mind about it, right? Maybe somehow it would deeply affect me, and I would choose to discontinue the operation ... I don’t know. I’m a full human being.” For now, Wilson is stuck waiting to find out if the courts will allow him to upload those gun blueprints, despite the fact that other websites already have posted the exact files that Defense Distributed was hosting on its own site, according to Greenberg. “The government has, essentially, failed, even though they tried this legal approach, they have failed to censor this information. It’s getting out there,” Greenberg explained. In the meantime, Wilson is continuing business, shipping out those milling machines, of which he said he’s sold a thousand so far this year. Despite all the legal battles ahead, Wilson says he refuses to back down. “A gun is power and this is the essence of this project… I'm actually giving people the means to create a power for themselves and I'm zealous to do that. That's real for me” he said. “People can misuse it, but it's power all the same. It's a conversation beyond good and evil.”",Cody Wilson 3D printed firearms Defense Distributed 3D printing Gun Liberator Ghost gun Sexual assault Gun control Right to keep and bear arms,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Districting, at his factory in Austin, Tex.",Entrepreneur behind fight for sharing 3D printed gun blueprints on why he's advocating for 'the people's right to keep and bear arms' A judge temporarily stopped Cody Wilson from posting 3-D gun blueprints online.

The attorney who represented a woman who was harassed by alleged Maryland newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos from 2009 to 2011 described him as a ""dangerous person."" Nearly seven years ago, Ramos pleaded guilty to a criminal harassment charge, court documents filed in the District Court of Maryland in Anne Arundel County show. Ramos, now 38, had befriended the woman on Facebook in 2009 and used information he gathered from the social media platform to attack her, Brennan McCarthy told ABC News. ""He would tell her to do things like hang herself,"" McCarthy said. ""He wrote a letter to her [employer] stating that they should fire her because she's a 'bipolar drunkard.' He did terrible things to this woman."" On Thursday, Ramos allegedly entered 888 Bestgate Road, the building that houses the newsroom for the Capital Gazette, and opened fire on employees for the local newspaper, killing five people, according to the Anne Arundel Police Department. The 888 Bestgate Road building is seen after police received reports of multiple people being shot at The Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Md., June 28, 2018. Jose Luis Magana/AP In 2012, Ramos had filed a defamation lawsuit against the Capital Gazette following a story about the harassment case, former editor and publisher Tom Marquardt told ABC News. The article, which was written in 2011, stated that Ramos had reached out to a former high school classmate on Facebook, asking for help because he was having some issues. The woman, who was not named in the story, tried to help and suggested that he seek counseling. ""That sparked months of emails in which Ramos alternately asked for help, called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself,"" the article said. Jarrod Ramos, 38, of Laurel, Maryland, is seen in this undated mug shot. Anne Arundel Police A judge placed Ramos on 18 months of supervised probation and ordered him to continue therapy and refrain from any further contact with the woman or her family, the court documents show. Ramos claimed he was defamed in the lawsuit against the Capital Gazette, which named Marquardt as well as the reporter who wrote it. A few months later, Ramos filed another complaint that added a charge of invasion of privacy. The case was ultimately dismissed. Marquardt had once received a death threat from Ramos and alerted authorities, but there was not enough evidence to file charges against him, he said. McCarthy described Ramos as ""incredibly angry."" ""The malice dripped off this man in court,"" he said. McCarthy was so affected by Ramos that he began to fear for his own life as well. Brennan McCarthy, the attorney who represented a woman who Maryland shooting suspect Jarrod Ramos had stalked from 2009 to 2011, described him to ABC News as a ""dangerous person."" ABC News After McCarthy got a second protective order for his client and agreed to accept all pleadings and correspondence on her behalf, Ramos allegedly began to harass him too. ""He then started stalking me, my Facebook feed, my own personal things,"" he said. ""...I have no doubt that he was on my street, and it was a very scary situation."" Each morning when he wakes up, McCarthy says se looks out the window to make sure Ramos isn't near his home. He still does it to this day, as does the woman he stalked, he said. ""He left that sort of impression on me,"" he said. ""This is a very dangerous person."" Steve Schuh, county executive of Anne Arundel County, holds a copy of The Capital Gazette near the scene of a shooting at the newspaper's office, June 29, 2018, in Annapolis, Md. Patrick Semansky/AP McCarthy also said that Ramos was ""smart enough to walk the edge so that he did not quite violate the law."" ""He would say things, like, for instance, 'Mr. McCarthy, wouldn't it be so sad if you were to be run over today and die bleeding in your own driveway, and if, perhaps, I might have been in the truck?' It's not a direct threat. It's a referential threat.'"" The woman whom Ramos stalked was so frightened by him that when she left the state, she didn't leave a forwarding address, and she alerted the local sheriff's office to Ramos in case he went looking for her, McCarthy said. ""She still has her gun,"" he said. ""...She's still scared."" Police stand watch outside the Robert F.

The gun-rights organization said it may soon have to stop producing its magazines and its video streaming service, NRAtv, because of actions by the state of New York, which the NRA accused of running a ""blacklisting campaign."" The campaign appears to be part of a national campaign calling for companies to cut ties with the group in the aftermath of several high profile shootings, most notably with the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The gun lobbying group claims in its lawsuit, which targets Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Department of Financial Services and Maria Vullo, which heads the department, that the state has caused ""irrecoverable loss and irreparable harm"" to the organization. But, of course, the organization is making these claims in a lawsuit, which it hopes to win. The Rolling Stone first obtained the lawsuit and published the 45-page complaint online Friday. Over several months, the NRA has taken aim at the state of New York and its financial regulators after the state ruled the NRA's insurance, ""Carry Guard,"" was illegal because it gave liability protection to gun owners for acts where there was ""intentional wrongdoing."" The NRA claims in its lawsuit that it has lost its insurance coverage, something it claims its carrier wouldn't renew for ""any price."" New York, the NRA says, has interfered with its business by coercing ""insurance agencies, insurers, and banks into terminating business relationships with the NRA that were necessary to the survival of the NRA.""

""Defendants seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional rights advocates. If their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed."" For years, the NRA has boasted about its large membership, which it claims to be about 5 million, though actual figures have never been released. The organization in its yearly tax filings shows it rakes in an average total of about $128 million. The Washington Post notes that number has varied over the years from a $72 million in 2006 to $228 million the following year. The newspaper notes the number of members appear to spike after a mass shooting. If true, one would think the back-to-back shootings in Florida, Texas, Nevada and Tennessee would have helped bolster the organization's finances. More:Feds: Russian operative tried to infiltrate National Rifle Association, other groups More:NRA draws fire from backers, foes for gun ban at event with Vice President Pence The organization is one of the largest lobbying groups. During the 2016 election cycle, the group spent $61 million to back current members of Congress, most of which benefitted Republicans. President Donald Trump received an additional $31 million in advertising during his campaign from the gun-rights group. But, Rolling Stone reported all that spending might have spelled some trouble for the group as the NRA overspent by $46 million in 2016. Students, who turned into gun-control advocates after the Parkland, Fla. shooting in February, applauded the news. The NRA has been their biggest target in the #NeverAgain movement, which reached a climax with the massive March for Our Lives rally in Washington. David Hogg, one of the leaders of the student-led movement, said the news is evidence ""the young people are winning."" Others offered the NRA ""thoughts and prayers,"" a common offering by politicians that's been criticized after mass shootings.

What's going on? Tom Stites, a Democrat running for Oklahoma House District 2, has challenged Republican Jim Olsen to a shooting competition, According to the Tulsa World, Stites doubts that Olsen ""is a real gun guy,"" claiming that Olsen is posturing himself as pro-firearm only because it is politically advantageous. The only solution to the problem, Stites believes, is for each candidate to show potential constituents their firearm proficiency. ""I believe it's important for the voters of this county to know which of us is the real deal and which of us truly understands the awesome power of firearms, how to safely handle them, how to teach about them, and how to be a leader on this sacred constitutional right,"" Stites explained in a video posted to his Facebook page. Stites also proposed each candidate use the competition to raise money for charity. If Stites won the competition, he pledged to donate money to Oklahomans for Life, a pro-life advocacy organization. ""Let's let the gun owners of Sequoyah County see who is the most skilled, knowledgeable, and best choice to represent them on the Second Amendment,"" Stites said. ""It's extremely rare when voters can have a real way to judge a candidate's competency on a given subject. Let's do it for them."" According to Stites' campaign website, he is a ""strong supporter"" of the Second Amendment and a member of the National Rifle Association who ""is an accomplished competitive shooter and a graduate of two different long range sniper schools.""

The Republican politician told the Tulsa World there is no reason for him to participate in a shooting competition. ""We are not running to be the sniper of Sequoyah County, but we are running for state representative,” Olsen said.

Andrew Cuomo (D) could make it “unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission.” In the July 20 amended complaint, first reported by the New York Law Journal’s Dan M. Clark and embedded at the bottom of this article, the NRA accuses Cuomo, as well as New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) Superintendent Maria Vullo, of issuing a “series of threats to financial institutions that DFS … will exercise its extensive regulatory power against those entities that fail to sever ties with the NRA.” The threats amount to a series of warnings and regulatory actions by the New York state government targeting insurance companies and other financial entities doing business with the NRA, warning that working with the group would put financial businesses in legal jeopardy or damage their public reputation. While it’s in the NRA’s interest to exaggerate the danger Cuomo and his allies’ actions pose to the group (so as to strengthen the lawsuit’s case), the complaint argues that Cuomo’s actions could wind up threatening the NRA’s continued existence. These threats, the complaint goes on to argue, endanger the financial viability of the organization by putting its access to financial services at risk. Cuomo could, the complaint states, “imminently deprive the NRA of basic bank-depository services, corporate insurance coverage, and other financial services essential to the NRA’s corporate existence and its advocacy mission.” To pay its employees, buy mailing materials, have a website, accept donations and membership dues, etc., the group needs basic checking account services. To keep holding its annual meeting and other rallies, it needs event insurance coverage. And in particular, it needs media liability coverage to run NRATV and other media projects. Without it, “it is likely that NRATV would be forced to cease operating,” the complaint states. The complaint further argues that the organization is having real difficulties securing this coverage. In January, it states, the NRA began negotiations with “a major DFS-regulated insurance carrier” (which it only refers to as the “Corporate Carrier”) to renew its general liability, umbrella, and media liability insurance policies. In February, the insurance company Lockton, which is not the corporate carrier in the suit but which collaborated with the NRA on its “Carry Guard” line of insurance products, publicly announced it would stop working with the NRA. The corporate carrier then, the complaint says, “abruptly reversed its position” and said it was “unwilling to renew coverage at any price” (emphasis in original). “The NRA has encountered serious difficulties obtaining corporate insurance coverage to replace coverage withdrawn by the Corporate Carrier,” the complaint says. “Nearly every carrier has indicated that it fears transacting with the NRA specifically in light of DFS’s actions.” Multiple banks, it continues, have also withdrawn bids to do basic depository services for the NRA. The origins of the Cuomo v. NRA battle The lawsuit dates the New York state government’s efforts against the NRA to September 2017, and blames it on pressure from Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control group financially backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In October 2017, the lawsuit notes, New York’s Department of Financial Services began investigating the “Carry Guard” line of insurance products, a firearms training program from the NRA that also offers insurance “to cover legal fees and liabilities arising from self-defense shootings.” But “the scope of the DFS investigation expanded rapidly” and by late 2017 and early 2018, the NRA says, the DFS was pressuring banks and insurers to stop working with the NRA. As the Trace’s Alex Yablon explains, the dispute became very public in April when Cuomo called on the Department of Financial Services to “urge insurance companies … to review any relationships they may have with the National Rifle Association and other similar organizations” and to “consider whether such ties harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety.” In May, DFS reached settlements including more than $8 million in fines against Chubb and Lockton Affinity, two insurance companies that supported Carry Guard. In a press release on the Lockton case, DFS Superintendent Vullo said that the Carry Guard program “unlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for certain acts of intentional wrongdoing, and improperly provided insurance coverage for criminal defense.” As part of the settlements, Lockton and Chubb both agreed to refrain from participating in Carry Guard or selling similar products to New York residents. Cuomo has been a vocal gun control advocate for years, and it’s not exactly surprising that he would choose to target the NRA. From his perspective, DFS is taking perfectly legitimate, legal actions against the group after the NRA and its commercial partners violated state laws regulating insurance and the marketing of insurance. From the NRA’s perspective, Cuomo is creating a “de facto censorship scheme” meant to chill pro-gun rights speech and the NRA’s right to free association. What does this mean for the NRA’s future? The complaint depicts an organization in mortal peril, whose lack of access to basic financial instruments could threaten its very existence. But the NRA is a mass-membership organization with powerful supporters in the federal government and the business community. A skeptical reader might argue that the NRA is trying to portray itself as more threatened than it really is in order to strengthen its case against Cuomo and enable it to resume offering its Carry Guard line of insurance products. That said, the reputational pressure the group is facing, in light of the Parkland school shooting and renewed gun control advocacy by students and others, is very real. An anonymous source at Ackerman McQueen, an advertising/PR firm that has worked closely with the NRA, gave Yablon at the Trace a candid explanation. The source said, as Yablon put it, that the NRA was “counting on Carry Guard to provide revenue after Donald Trump’s 2016 election win.” Democratic presidents are incredibly good for NRA membership and gun sales generally, because they create fear of new gun control laws. Republican presidents make gun activists more complacent, which can make the NRA strapped. Notably, the NRA is asking for Cuomo and Vallo to pay for damages caused by “lost prospective business relations.” That is, if Carry Guard can’t get them money, they want to get it by suing.",Dana Loesch National Rifle Association 2018 NRA boycott Image Speech Dark money Spokesperson Republican Party News,The National Rifle Association is suing New York for a lawsuit against the National Rifle Association.,"The National Rifle Association (NRA), the premier pro-gun lobby in the United States and arguably one of the country’s most powerful interest groups on any policy topic, says that efforts to fight it by New York Gov.

The guns rights organization made the claim in documents filed in a New York federal court in late July, which were first reported by Rolling Stone. The NRA is suing the New York State Department of Financial Services and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after the state agency encouraged financial services companies in New York not to do business with the gun rights organization after the Florida shooting. The NRA argues in its lawsuit that it's been the victim of a ""discrimination campaign"" and that it has suffered harm to its reputation and marketing damages worth tens of millions of dollars. ""The NRA has suffered tens of millions of dollars in damages,"" the lawsuit read. ""Such damages include, without limitation, damages due to reputational harm, increased development and marketing costs for any potential new NRA-endorsed insurance programs, and lost royalty amounts owed to the NRA, as well as attorneys’ fees, legal expenses, and other costs.""

It just happened in the last day and a half.” But Trump, Rubio and McConnell are dead wrong: Not forcing these conversations is, quite literally, a fatal mistake. ADVERTISEMENT Discussing gun violence has become so poisonous and polarizing that it exerts a strong impact on our everyday lives and personal relationships. Some Americans who have firearms safely stored in their home, won’t bring this topic up lest others think they are Second Amendment zealots with a basement bunker stocked for a coming ammo-pocalypse. Others don’t mention the “G-word” lest they be accused of being a “libtard.” This isn’t healthy — not confronting the reality that kids get shot when they play with unsecured firearms makes such accidents sure to happen. In more public contexts, our historical reluctance to force these conversations has made it more difficult to start them in the first place. It’s hard to have educated and informed exchanges thanks to the Dickey Amendment, a provision inserted into a 1996 federal spending bill mandating that no funds allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be used to “advocate or promote gun control” — enacting a de facto ban on gun violence research — resources the lack of which we literally “die for.” Our unwillingness to talk about guns and gun violence has even made it easy for states to make such discourse downright unlawful. Indiana state law, for example, bars public and private employers from asking employees about whether they own, use, or transport a gun, with no public safety exception. If they do, they can be slapped with a civil suit for economic damages, court costs, and even punitive damages. While this law might make gun owners more comfortable, it puts others at risk by preventing employers from adequately protecting other employees from at-risk colleagues. If Bob in marketing is suicidal, or threatens Mary down in sales, then Bob’s boss is in a really tough position, and might hesitate to ask Bob whether he has a firearm readily at hand in his car trunk in the parking lot. And that hesitation might be fatal. Such restrictions are particularly mystifying when the law affirmatively protects the right to discuss gun ownership, access, and safety — even though such conversations can be discomfiting. In Wollschlauger v. Governor of Florida, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit declared unconstitutional a Florida law that ostensibly protected “patient privacy” by prohibiting physicians from asking patients about their ownership and use of firearms. That law, the court held, violated physicians’ First Amendment rights, interfering with professional standards that require them to ask and educate about firearm ownership. Patients who were uncomfortable with such questions could refuse to answer — and such topics were certainly not the only difficult discussions to emerge in doctor-patient conversations. Our growing reluctance to talk about firearms and firearm violence doesn’t respect the Second Amendment; it turns it into a club used to bully others into silence and submission. This is the opposite of what the Second Amendment is intended to be — the constitutional provision that, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia put it in District of Columbia v. Heller, has “protected the rights of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” Using the Second Amendment as a silencer bastardizes it, undermining the civil discourse essential to democracy, creating and reinforcing a flawed narrative that fundamentally changes what people think gun ownership is about and warps popular understandings of the Second Amendment. That’s how we come to believe that “shall not infringe” means literally that no firearms regulations are permissible, equate gun safety education to gun-grabbing schemes, and misconstrue even pro-Second Amendment Supreme Court cases as unconstitutional judicial activism — all dangerous misconceptions that perpetuate and strengthen the politicization of Second Amendment issues and mass shootings. The first step in preventing gun violence — from domestic assaults with firearms to school shootings like Newtown and Parkland with high body counts — is to talk about them in meaningful ways that go beyond thoughts and prayers and Facebook posts to engagement and research. Without these resources, Second Amendment advocates and opponents won’t find common ground, and the majority of us who are caught in the middle can’t learn from these exchanges. These conversations might get messy, uncomfortable, emotional and downright infuriating, but have them we must.

But there’s less consensus on whether media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence, which is a more serious form of aggression in which the perpetrator is subject to arrest and incarceration — the sort of violence that includes using a weapon to harm or kill people. The link between media violence and mass shootings is even more tenuous. Compared with acts of aggression and violence, mass shootings are relatively rare events, which makes conducting conclusive research on them difficult. President Trump first raised the issue during a meeting on school safety with local and state officials, which took place a week after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The shooter, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, reportedly obsessively played violent video games. Trump, Feb. 22: We have to look at the Internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds, and their minds are being formed. And we have to do something about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it. And also video games. I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts. And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies, they’re so violent. Trump discussed the issue again with members of Congress on Feb. 28 during another meeting on school safety. During that discussion, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, now running for the Senate, claimed mothers have told her they’re “very concerned” that “exposure” to entertainment media has “desensitized” children to violence.

Chuck Grassley also said during the meeting: “[Y]ou see all these films about everybody being blown up. Well, just think of the impact that makes on young people.” The points Trump and members of Congress raise aren’t unfounded, but the research on the subject is complex. Scientists who study the effect of media violence have taken issue with how the popular press has portrayed their work, arguing that the nuance of their research is often left out. In a 2015 review of the scientific literature on video game violence, the American Psychological Association elaborates on this point. APA, 2015: News commentators often turn to violent video game use as a potential causal contributor to acts of mass homicide. The media point to perpetrators’ gaming habits as either a reason they have chosen to commit their crimes or as a method of training. This practice extends at least as far back as the Columbine massacre (1999). … As with most areas of science, the picture presented by this research is more complex than is usually depicted in news coverage and other information prepared for the general public. Here, we break down the facts — nuance included — on the effect of media violence on young people. Is media violence a risk factor for aggression? The 2015 report by the APA on video games is a good place to start. After systematically going through the scientific literature, the report’s authors “concluded that violent video game use has an effect on aggression.” In particular, the authors explain that this effect manifests as an increase in aggressive behaviors, thoughts and feelings and a decrease in helping others, empathy and sensitivity to aggression. Though limited, evidence also suggests that “higher amounts of exposure” to video games is linked to “higher levels of aggression,” the report said. The report emphasized that “aggression is a complex behavior” caused by multiple factors, each of which increases the likelihood that an individual will be aggressive. “Children who experience multiple risk factors are more likely to engage in aggression,” the report said. More:Kentucky governor blames violent video games, movies, not guns for school shootings More:States with the most (and least) gun violence. See where your state stacks up. The authors came to their conclusions because researchers have consistently found the effect across three different kinds of studies: cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies and laboratory experiments. “One method’s limits are offset by another method’s strengths,” the APA report explains, so only together can they be used to infer a causal relationship. Cross-sectional studies find correlations between different phenomena at one point in time. They’re relatively easy to conduct, but they can’t provide causal evidence because correlations can be spurious. For example, an increase in video game sales might correlate with a decrease in violent crime, but that doesn’t necessarily mean video games prevent violent crime. Other unknown factors might also be at play. Longitudinal panel studies collect data on the same group over time, sometimes for decades. They’re used to investigate long-term effects, such as whether playing video games as a child might correlate with aggression as an adult. These studies also measure other risk factors for aggression, such as harsh discipline from parents, with the aim of singling out the effect of media violence. For this reason, these studies provide better evidence for causality than cross-sectional studies, but they are more difficult to conduct. Laboratory experiments manipulate one phenomenon — in this case, exposure to media violence — and keep all others constant. Because of their controlled environment, experiments provide strong evidence for a causal effect. But for the same reason, laboratory studies may not accurately reflect how people act in the real world. This brings us to why debate still exists among scientists studying media violence. Some researchers have found that the experimental evidence backing the causal relationship between playing video games and aggression might not be as solid as it seems. Last July, Joseph Hilgard, an assistant professor of psychology at Illinois State University, and others published a study in the journal Psychological Bulletin that found that laboratory experiments on the topic may be subject to publication bias. This means that studies that show the effect may be more likely to be published than those that don’t, skewing the body of evidence. After Hilgard corrected for this bias, the effect of violent video games on aggressive behavior and emotions did still exist, but it was reduced, perhaps even to near zero. However, the effect on aggressive thoughts remained relatively unaffected by this publication bias. The researchers also found that cross-sectional studies weren’t subject to publication bias. They didn’t examine longitudinal studies, which have shown that youth who play more violent video games are more likely to report aggressive behavior over time. Hilgard looked at a 2010 literature review by Craig A. Anderson, the director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University, and others. Published in Psychological Bulletin, this review influenced the APA’s report. In response, Anderson took a second look at his review and found that the effect of violent video games on aggression was smaller than he originally thought, but not as small as Hilgard found. For this reason, he argued the effect was still a “societal concern.” To be clear, Hilgard is arguing that there’s more uncertainty in the field than originally thought, not that video games have no effect on aggression. He’s also not the first to find that research on video games may be suffering from publication bias. But what about movies and television? Reviews of the literature on these forms of media tend to be less recent, Kenneth A. Dodge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, told us by email. Dodge, also one of the authors of the 2015 APA study, pointed us to one 1994 review of the literature on television published in the journal Communication Research that concluded that television violence also “increases aggressiveness and antisocial behavior.” Dodge told us he’s “confident” the effect this analysis and others found “would hold again today.” Dodge also pointed us to a 2006 study that reviewed the literature on violent video games, films, television and other media together. “Most contemporary studies start with the premise that children are exposed [to violence] through so many diverse media that they start to group them together,” said Dodge. Published in JAMA Pediatrics, the review found that exposure to violent media increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior, thoughts and feelings. The review also found media decreases the likelihood of helping behavior. All of these effects were “modest,” the researchers concluded. Overall, most of the research suggests media violence is a risk factor for aggression, but some experts in the field still question whether there’s enough evidence to conclusively say there’s a link. Is violent media a risk factor for violence? There’s even less evidence to suggest media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence. “In psychological research, aggression is usually conceptualized as behavior that is intended to harm another,” while, “[v]iolence can be defined as an extreme form of physical aggression,” the 2015 APA report explains. “Thus, all violence is aggression, but not all aggression is violence.” The APA report said studies have been conducted on media violence’s relationship with “criminal violence,” but the authors “did not find enough evidence of sufficient utility to evaluate whether” there’s a solid link to violent video game use. This lack of evidence is due, in part, to the fact that there are ethical limitations to conducting experiments on violence in the laboratory, especially when it comes to children and teens, the report explains. That leaves only evidence from cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies. So what do those studies say? One longitudinal study, published in the journal Developmental Psychology in 2003, found that, out of 153 males, those who watched the most violent television as children were more likely 15 years later “to have pushed, grabbed, or shoved their spouses, to have responded to an insult by shoving a person” or to have been “to have been convicted of a crime” during the previous year. Girls who watched the most violent television were also more likely to commit similar acts as young women. These effects persisted after controlling for other risk factors for aggression, such as parental aggression and intellectual ability. A 2012 cross-sectional study that Anderson, at Iowa State, and others published in the journal Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice did find that the amount of violent video games juvenile delinquents played correlated with how many violent acts they had committed over the past year. The violent acts included gang fighting, hitting a teacher, hitting a parent, hitting other students and attacking another person. However, a 2008 review of the literature published in the journal Criminal Justice and Behavior concluded that “the effects of exposure to media violence on criminally violent behavior have not been established.” But the authors clarify: “Saying that the effect has not been established is not the same as saying that the effect does not exist.” In contrast to the APA report, Anderson and a colleague argue in a 2015 article published in American Behavioral Scientist that “research shows that media violence is a causal risk factor not only for mild forms of aggression but also for more serious forms of aggression, including violent criminal behavior.” Why did Anderson and his colleagues come to different conclusions than the APA? He told us that the APA “did not include the research literature on TV violence,” and excluded “several important studies on video game effects on violent behavior published since 2013.” In their 2015 article, Anderson and his colleague clarify that, even if there is a link, it “does not mean that violent media exposure by itself will turn a normal child or adolescent who has few or no other risk factors into a violent criminal or a school shooter.” They add, “Such extreme violence is rare, and tends to occur only when multiple risk factors converge in time, space, and within an individual.” Multiple experts we spoke with did point to one factor unique to the United States that they argue increases the risk of mass shootings and lethality of violence in general — access to guns. For example, Anderson told us by email: “There is a pretty strong consensus among violence researchers in psychology and criminology that the main reason that U.S. homicide rates are so much higher than in most Western democracies is our easy access to guns.” Dodge, at Duke, echoed Anderson’s point.”The single most obvious and probably largest difference between a country like the US that has many mass shootings and other developed countries is the easy access to guns,” he said. So while scientists disagree about how much evidence is enough to sufficiently support a causal link between media violence and real world violence, Trump and other politicians’ concerns aren’t unfounded.

Photograph: Laura Heald/AP A gunman who killed two people and wounded nine others before shooting himself dead at a video gamers’ tournament in Florida on Sunday was known to fellow players as an aloof and insular character who made little effort to make friends on the competition circuit. Authorities in Jacksonville were on Monday looking into one theory that David Katz, 24, opened fire in anger after losing a match at the Madden NFL 19 tournament, an event themed on the popular American football video game that was taking place in a bar at the back of a pizza restaurant at the Jacksonville Landing shopping complex. Katz, who was known by the gaming handle Sliced Bread, or just Bread, was a leading player on the popular game’s national tour and had won a satellite round of the tournament in Buffalo, New York, last year. But he had lost at least two games during the weekend event in Florida, forfeiting his chance to attend the national finals in Las Vegas in October. Players who beat him said he refused to shake their hands and was “acting weird” all weekend. Other survivors of the shooting told of chaotic scenes as those caught up in the violence trampled over others in panic as they tried to escape. One witness said she saw Katz as he fired while walking backwards. “We did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds,” said Taylor Poindexter, 26, who had been ordering pizza at the bar when she heard the first shot at about 1.30pm. “I was scared for my life and my boyfriend’s,” she told reporters, standing on crutches after spraining her ankle trying to escape. While police have not identified the victims, family members told Jacksonville CBS television station WJAX that the two people killed were Eli Clayton, from California, and Taylor Robertson, a husband and father from West Virginia. Both were tournament contestants. Robertson was the winner of the tournament last year. Katz, from Baltimore, won it the year before, the Miami Herald reported, citing family and friends posting online. Story continues “No one deserves to die over playing a video game, you know?” said Derek Jones, 30, a competitor from Santa Fe, New Mexico. “We’re just out here trying to win some money for our families.” Jones said he was sitting in a patio outside the tournament venue when he heard gunshots and jumped over a fence to flee. “You know, I’m glad I lost today,” he said. “Because if I’d won, I would have been in that game bar right then playing a game and not paying attention. And he could have come and I’d probably be dead right now.” Jones said he knew Katz by the gamer tags he used online, often “Bread” or “Sliced Bread”, and had played against him online but had never spoken to him personally. Fellow players left tributes to both men on social media pages. “I hope their memories are respected through people learning and understanding what other people feel and other people are going through,” said Toshiba Sharon, the announcer at the event. “We are all one. We’ve got to address the people next to us and change.” Coverage of Katz competing in the past showed him with headphones on and a poker face as commentators remarked on his attitude. “He’s not here to make friends. He’s all business. He’s focused and to even get him to open up to talk about anything it’s like pulling teeth, man,” said one. The Jacksonville sheriff, Mike Williams, said Katz, of Baltimore, Maryland, carried out the attack using at least one handgun at the Jacksonville Landing, a collection of restaurants and shops, before taking his own life. The maker of the Madden game, EA Sports, lists a David Katz as a 2017 championship winner. Sunday’s competition was held in a gaming bar but viewers could watch the games online and see the players. On Sunday evening, FBI and ATF teams searched Katz’s family home. Heavily armed agents, some in bulletproof vests and carrying long guns, could be seen entering a complex near Baltimore’s Inner Harbour. The Jacksonville sheriff’s department was on Monday liaising with the federal agents, who had removed a small box and a bag from the residence where Katz lived with his divorced father. Marquis Williams, the boyfriend of one of the witnesses, Poindexter, called for elected officials to take action to curb gun violence. “Politicians, wake up because the people you’re supposed to represent are dying,” Williams said. “Quit sitting on your butts. Quit collecting checks and do something.” Rick Scott, the Republican governor of a state that has seen several other recent mass shootings committed by lone male killers – at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in February and Orlando’s Pulse nightclub in June 2016 – would not say if he thought gun laws needed tightening . “The first thing people want to do is make it political,” he said at a late Sunday press conference. “We have got to change. Why are young men willing to give up their life, or why don’t they value someone else’s life? This is an issue that our society is going to have to deal with. We’ve got to figure out why this is happening.” • This article was amended on 28 August 2018 to correct a reference to David Katz.",Jacksonville Landing Jacksonville Landing shooting Madden NFL 19 Shooting Video Games Mass shooting Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Gun Game,"A police officer at the scene of the shooting at a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday.",Witnesses of shooting at video gamers’ event in Jacksonville tell of moment gunman opened fire Police officers attend the incident at the Jacksonville Landing.

(Photo: Facebook/HillsboroughPoliceDepartment) People are officially preparing for the holidays and all the gift giving that comes with the season. So one police department in North Carolina is making sure that families can “avoid tragedy” by not purchasing a specific type of gift for their children — a toy gun. In a PSA posted to the Hillsborough Police Department’s Facebook page, officers warn people about the gift that can quickly become controversial and even fatal. With side-by-side pictures of an airsoft replica gun (an air gun used in so-called airsoft sports) and a real handgun, it becomes evident that the two aren’t dissimilar. And in terms of how to handle either kind, the department’s message is clear: Any gun should be treated as real. “A gun should never be pointed at another person unless deadly force is necessary; these airsoft guns are real in the eyes of a law enforcement officer, CCW holder or someone protecting their home,” the post reads. “There is no way to tell a difference when making a split second decision.” According to Lt. Andy Simmons, he and fellow officers were “taken aback” by the realness of the airsoft replica gun that they found in stores just last week. “Upon seeing that, myself and my training officer said we need to do a PSA about this just so parents who are looking to get something like this for their kid understand what they’re getting themselves into,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “The fundamentals of gun safety always apply, whether they’re airsoft, replica or real.” Similar warnings have been put out about phone cases that resemble guns, about which a California police department explained “law enforcement will respond accordingly for a subject with a gun call.” The bottom line from Hillsborough officers is “be very responsible with these ‘toys’.” Read more from Yahoo Lifestyle: • Officer went into ‘dad mode’ when he confronted boys with realistic-looking toy gun: ‘Do you think I want to shoot an 11-year-old?’ • Teen hailed as hero for reporting classmate with gun and preventing possible school shooting • Photographer defends picture of baby boy posing with a BB gun: ‘This photo is in no way meant to encourage gun violence’ Story continues Follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.",Airsoft Guns Airsoft Gun Firearm Trigger Pistol BB gun  Glock Shooting,"A police officer in Hillsborough, N.C., with a toy gun used in so-called air pencil sports.",Police department posts warning against airsoft replica guns.

Helus, 54, who is survived by his wife and son, was looking to retire soon, the sheriff's office said. Instead, he made ""the ultimate sacrifice,"" Dean said.

Two of them said he displayed a gun. A black man who drives a septic truck told Pinellas Sheriff's Detective George Moffett that he parked in the same handicapped-accessible spot three months before McGlockton's July 19 videotaped shooting, the court documents show. The man said Drejka, 48, began yelling at him and said he would shoot him. The driver said he left, but as he pulled away, Drejka shouted racial slurs. The man's boss told Detective Moffett that Drejka later called, telling him ""that he was lucky he didn't blow his employee's head off."" Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox In separate 2012 cases, drivers reported that Drejka waved a gun at them during road rage confrontations. In both cases, officers stopped Drejka and found a gun in his car, but he denied showing it to the other drivers. Michael Drejka Pinellas County Sheriff's Office On Tuesday, a Florida judge kept bond at $100,000 for Drejka, who was charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a 28-year-old McGlockton, a black man who shoved him outside a convenience store in a dispute over parking. Judge Joseph Bulone in the Pinellas County court said that if Drejka posts bail, he must surrender all of his guns to the sheriff, wear an ankle monitor and not leave the county. He said he didn't have the money to hire a private attorney, which means a public defender will be appointed. McGlockton's girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, was seated in the couple's car on July 19 with two of their children, ages 3 years and 4 months, when she said Drejka confronted her for being parked in a handicapped-accessible space. McGlockton had gone into the store with the couple's 5-year-old son, also named Markeis. ""I can tell my kids now that the police got the bad man,"" Jacobs said, following the brief bond hearing. She was one of several family members who attended. ""I'm still answering their questions about when daddy is going to wake up. And all I can tell them is, daddy is resting right now."" Video of the July incident showed McGlockton leaving the store and shoving Drejka to the ground. Seconds later, Drejka pulled a handgun and shot McGlockton as he backed away. McGlockton then ran back into the store clutching his chest. Witnesses said he collapsed in front of young Markeis, who was waiting inside. McGlockton later died at a nearby hospital. ""The charges are only one step in this journey to get justice for the unbelievable killing of Markeis McGlockton in front of his children,"" said Benjamin Crump, the family's attorney. ""They understand when you look at the history of the state of Florida and stand your ground that this doesn't equal a conviction. All of America is watching Clearwater, Florida to see if there will be equal justice for Markeis McGlockton ... If the facts were in reverse, nobody would doubt what the outcome would be."" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri originally declined to charge Drejka, saying one day after the shooting that the man was protected by Florida's stand-your-ground law. The sheriff passed the case to prosecutors for a final decision. The McGlockton family said Monday the manslaughter charge provides them ""with a small measure of comfort in our time of profound mourning.""

House race,"Gun control advocate Lucia “Lucy” McBath won her race for Congress in Georgia’s long-red 6th District on Thursday toppling GOP incumbent Karen Handel in an unexpected victory. On Wednesday midday, McBath declared victory in the very tight race, reported the Atlanta Journal Constitution, though Handel didn’t concede until Thursday morning. After carefully reviewing all of the election results, it is clear that I came up a bit short on Tuesday. Congratulations to Representative-Elect Lucy McBath & I send her only good thoughts and much prayer for the journey that lies ahead for her. More:https://t.co/LxHfmnqf4b — Karen Handel (@karenhandel) November 8, 2018 McBath, a political newcomer, upset Handel, who beat Democrat Jon Ossoff in last year’s special election ― the most expensive House race in history. McBath’s victory in the suburban Atlanta district, long a Republican stronghold, could be seen as a turning point for Democrats seeking to change the state from red to purple. McBath’s district, much like the rest of Georgia, has grown increasingly diverse in recent years, with more people of color, and likely Democrats, moving in. The closely watched governor’s race in Georgia remained too close to call on Thursday morning, with Democrat Stacey Abrams vying to become the nation’s first black female governor, running against Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Kemp faced accusations of voter suppression, which he denied. McBath’s race also may have reflected Americans’ evolving views on gun control. She campaigned on a bold gun control platform in a state with gun-friendly laws in the heart of the Deep South, which has some of the nation’s highest rates of gun ownership. McBath, 58, was thrust into the national spotlight in 2012, when her black 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot dead at a Florida gas station by a white man complaining about loud music. The killer claimed he was justified under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law, but a jury convicted him of first-degree murder. Story continues McBath later became a spokesperson for gun safety group Moms Demand Action. After the Parkland, Florida, school mass shooting in February, she set her sights on Congress. “I knew that I could no longer sit on the sidelines,” McBath wrote on her campaign site, “while the politicians in the pocket of the gun manufacturing lobby decide the future of our gun laws.” McBath was part of a record wave of women ― specifically women of color ― nominated for public office in the 2018 elections. On Thursday, she joined the unprecedented number of women to be elected to the U.S. House. (Photo: Mike Pont/WireImage via Getty Images) A two-time breast cancer survivor who worked for decades as a flight attendant, McBath also campaigned for more affordable health care and a higher minimum wage. Her platform called for “common-sense” gun control measures, like background checks, restricting purchases for anyone with a domestic violence history and raising the age to purchase any gun to 21. McBath’s district, while majority Republican, tended to lean moderate, with a highly educated and relatively affluent population. The district was previously represented by Republicans Newt Gingrich and Tom Price, but only narrowly went for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. “This is just not your grandfather’s Georgia,” Alabama-based Democratic pollster Zac McCrary told HuffPost last month, adding that the state was “becoming more Democratic by the day.” Turnout for McBath may also have been aided by Democratic voters showing up for Stacey Abrams in the governor’s race, and by energy against Trump and Republicans’ hold on Congress. Former President Barack Obama and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton both endorsed McBath, as did gun reform groups Giffords and Everytown for Gun Safety (Moms Demand Action is its grassroots arm), EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood. “People have an idea of what they think Georgia is: super-conservative and really red. None of those things are true,” Nse Ufot, executive director of the New Georgia Project, said of McBath’s race last month. Ufot’s group has registered more than 250,000 black and Latino voters in the state in recent years. McBath’s candidacy, she said, “seems right on time for parents of school-aged kids concerned about losing kids to gun violence.” Related Coverage Women Of Color Candidates For 2018: ‘You’re Going To Have To Learn How To Say Our Names’ Can Gun Control Advocate Lucy McBath Win In Gun-Loving Georgia?

He initially told authorities that he mistakenly fired his gun at the boy because he tripped, something that the video did not appear to capture. “I was scared,” the teen testified. “I was trying to tell them that I was trying to get to high school, but they weren’t listening.” Brennan’s mother, Lisa Wright, said she had no doubt that the shooting was racially motivated. “If there was a button that I could press for me to pick what color I could be, just so I wouldn’t have to deal with this type of stuff, I would have to be your color just so I could survive,” she said in court, according to Detroit station WXYZ. Brennan’s father, who serves in the military and was deployed in Syria with special forces when the incident took place, attended Tuesday’s sentencing and reportedly expressed his own concerns about his family’s safety, asking a WXYZ reporter how he can protect his country when no one is protecting his family.

Nunley wrote in his 15-page decision, KOVR-TV reported. The decision came as good news for the firearms dealers who filed the lawsuit after they were cited for violating the 1923 law. The law was originally passed in hopes of curbing suicides and other violent acts. Rob Adams, the owner of Sacramento Black Rifle Shop, told KOVR that he had been unaware that his logo, which had a handgun embedded into the ""r"", was in violation of the law. ""It’s just an archaic law that nobody knew was on the books,” Adams said. After four years of litigation, the statute was struck down as unconstitutional on Tuesday. “Previous to today, we weren’t allowed to use any type of literature pictures or anything outside within the public’s view,” Adams said. What's the story? It all started when Sacramento Black Rifle Shop, Tracy Rifle and Pistol, along with other licensed gun dealers filed a lawsuit against the state, according to the Sacramento Bee. The lawsuit claimed the sellers had been stopped from using “truthful, non-misleading material advertising the sale of handguns at their places of business” by California Penal Code section 26820. For example, Tracy Rifle and Pistol was cited by the state's Department of Justice Bureau of Firearms for violating the 1923 law in September 2014.

What did the lawyers say? Brad Benbrook, one of the lawyers representing the firearms dealers, said he was pleased with the ruling. “This is an important victory for our clients and for the First Amendment. Judge Nunley decided that the State could not justify its censorship of our clients, and we are delighted with the opinion,"" Benbrook said in a statement to the Bee. “As the court explained today, the government cannot censor commercial speech in a paternalistic effort to keep citizens from making unpopular choices — or choices the government doesn’t approve — if they are told the truth.” What did the state say?

Here’s why I changed my mind.,"At the time, the Senate was voting on several gun-violence-prevention proposals, trying to find a bill that could get 60 votes. To me, it was clear that strengthening the background-check system would be the single most effective way to begin to stem the tide of gun violence in the United States. AD However, every proposal the Senate voted on that day fell short. Congress, in what has become a sad pattern of dysfunction, failed to act. AD In the years since the Senate last had a meaningful debate about gun-violence legislation, we’ve seen assault rifles and high-capacity magazines repeatedly used in mass shootings, with ever-higher body counts: Forty-nine murdered at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Fifty-eight killed and 422 wounded by gunfire in Las Vegas, one year ago Monday. We’ve seen the gun lobby close its eyes to the fact that assault rifles were the weapon of choice for the mass shooters at Parkland, Fla., and at Sandy Hook Elementary School — and to the reality that these weapons can kill with an efficiency that shotguns and handguns, like the ones I own, simply cannot match. AD Though I remain convinced that strengthening our background-check system is critical, I also believe we must do more to end mass shootings. So today I am signing on as a sponsor of the assault weapons ban. AD I do this as a gun owner and a proud supporter of the Second Amendment. Before coming to the Senate, I served as governor of Virginia, a state with a long tradition of gun ownership. During my time in office, I signed into law a number of reasonable bipartisan bills solidifying the rights of law-abiding gun owners to purchase and carry firearms for sport and self-defense. At the time, the National Rifle Association described me as a “valuable ally for gun owners and sportsmen.” While the NRA may have moved toward the extreme in the years since, I still believe in the Second Amendment. But like other parts of our Constitution, the Second Amendment isn’t absolute. For example, the law has long held that certain guns such as fully automatic rifles and accessories such as suppressors fall into a class of weapons requiring stricter oversight and regulation than your everyday hunting rifle. AD Unfortunately, these shades of gray needed for good policymaking have given way to the black and white of polarized political warfare that’s increasingly fueled by special-interest money. AD Still, I’m hopeful we can break this stalemate, disarming would-be mass shooters while still respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Restricting the sale of assault weapons is one such starting point. No doubt, there will need to be revisions and compromises before this bill becomes law. But let’s also recognize that the features and tactical accessories that define assault weapons under this legislation were designed for a specific purpose — to give soldiers an advantage over the enemy, not to mow down students in school hallways. AD We should acknowledge that while some will object to reasonable magazine-size limits, they would also force an active shooter to reload more often, buying law enforcement and potential shooting victims valuable seconds that could prove lifesaving. And let’s agree that modifications such as binary triggers and bump stocks, which skirt the law to effectively turn semiautomatic rifles into fully automatic weapons, should never have been on the streets in the first place. AD These are the core ideas behind the assault weapons ban. Some may worry that the technical challenges of defining an assault weapon may result in a law that’s either toothless or overly restrictive of gun rights. Frankly, I share those concerns, but it’s time to stop talking about the problem and do something about it. AD We have cultural divisions that must be bridged, but we should not allow these differences to become excuses for inaction. No American wants criminals, terrorists or dangerously ill teenagers to get their hands on a weapon capable of so much destruction. There is room for common ground here, and I believe it is this: Americans of all backgrounds can and should refuse to accept periodic mass shootings as the new normal, and we should demand that our nation’s leaders finally take action. I plan to be part of the solution.",Firearm Gun National Rifle Association Gun control Weapon Gun shop Assault weapon Right to keep and bear arms Shooting Gun ownership,A gun shop in Las Vegas.,"At the time, the Senate was voting on several gun-violence-prevention proposals, trying to find a bill that could get 60 votes.

Beierle, who killed himself on Friday after killing Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley and wounding five others at Hot Yoga Tallahassee, had filmed several virulently misogynist videos in 2014, according to David Mack, Amber Jamieson, and Julia Reinstein of BuzzFeed News. He had also uploaded sexist and violent songs to Soundcloud in the last few months. In the videos, Beierle rants about women who canceled dates or gave him their phone numbers even though they had boyfriends. He also mentions Elliot Rodger, the gunman who killed six people and wounded 13 in Isla Vista, California in 2014 — and who has become a hero to men who identify as “incels” (short for “involuntary celibate”). The Tallahassee shooting was the third crime in a single week that was apparently preceded by a trail of online hate. Robert Bowers, the man suspected of killing 11 people and wounding six others in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday, appears to have posted threatening language about Jewish people and HIAS National Refugee Shabbat, a refugee aid group formerly known as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, on Gab, a social network that has become a home for anti-Semitism and racism. Cesar Sayoc, the man arrested last Friday in connection with bombs mailed to CNN and several critics of President Donald Trump, appears to have threatened Democrats on Twitter and Facebook. “Hug your loved son,Niece,wife family real close everytime U walk out your home,” said one tweet sent to former Vice President Joe Biden, apparently by Sayoc. It included an image of Biden’s home with a target superimposed on it. The postings apparently made by Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were part of a pattern going back years. Elliot Rodger left behind a YouTube video in which he said women would be punished for not being attracted to him. And George Sodini, a gunman whose murder of three women at a gym outside Pittsburgh in 2009 appears to share similarities with the Tallahassee shooting, maintained a blog detailing his anger toward women for months before committing the crime. These men share more than their apparent online histories of bigotry. All were part of communities, online or off, that seemed to reinforce their views. That’s why online hatred and harassment is so serious. It’s not just that an individual person’s online posts can be warning signs of future violence. It’s also that hateful posts, even by those who never commit crimes, create an environment where those crimes are encouraged, accepted, and even celebrated. Many mass murderers and other criminals have left behind an online trail Beierle’s YouTube and SoundCloud history is rife with violent sexism. In one video, he says of a woman who canceled dates with him, “I could have ripped her head off,” according to BuzzFeed. In a song called “Locked in My Basement,” he describes holding a woman prisoner and raping her. He mentions Rodger in a video called “Plight of the Adolescent Male,” saying, “I’d like to send a message now to the adolescent males ... that are in the position, the situation, the disposition of Elliot Rodger, of not getting any, no love, no nothing. This endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration. That was me, certainly, as an adolescent.” Beierle had also been arrested in 2012 and 2016 for grabbing women’s buttocks without their consent, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. Meanwhile, posts apparently by Robert Bowers, the alleged Pittsburgh assailant, reveal a history of anti-Semitism, and a web of influences. On Gab, someone by the name of Robert Bowers posted a variety of anti-Semitic slurs and statements, including “jews are the children of satan,” according to the Associated Press. The same user criticized President Trump for being insufficiently anti-Jewish, and bragged about his gun collection, calling it his “glock family” and saying one gun in particular had an “amazing trigger.” As Vox’s Jane Coaston notes, Gab was started as a “free speech” alternative to Twitter, and allows forms of hate speech that are banned on more mainstream social networks. Because of this, it’s become a gathering place — and recruitment forum — for neo-Nazi groups. One post from a group called Atomwaffen Division features swastikas, racial slurs, and the invitation, “Join your local Nazis.” The synagogue shooting suspect also acted out of a specific kind of anti-Semitism, as Vox’s Dara Lind points out: “blaming Jews in America for bringing in an invasion of nonwhite immigrants who would slaughter the white race.” This particular kind of bigotry has been fueled by Trump’s claims that his political opponents are at fault for the caravan of migrants approaching the US, and by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists on Gab and other social networks, who have cast the caravan as a Jewish “invasion.” Most of the people posting this theory online have never committed anti-Semitic violence, but they helped create the conditions under which something like the Pittsburgh shooting could occur. Twitter and Facebook accounts connected to Sayoc contain threats against Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder, both of whom received pipe bombs. CNN analyst Phil Mudd also received a Twitter threat apparently from Sayoc. Political analyst Rochelle Ritchie reported a threat apparently from Sayoc to Twitter in the days before the shooting, but Twitter did not take action. Sayoc was apparently a devotee of a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which have spread on Twitter. As Vox’s German Lopez points out, he often posted criticisms of liberal billionaire George Soros, a common target of anti-Semitic fear-mongering on Twitter and elsewhere. Trump has fanned the flames of this fear-mongering, retweeting a claim earlier this year that Soros was a “nazi who turned in his fellow Jews.” Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were far from alone in leaving what appear to be online trails pointing to future violent behavior. “Tomorrow is the day of retribution,” Rodger said in his last YouTube video, according to the New York Times. “For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me.” “I do not know why you girls aren’t attracted to me,” he added. “But I will punish you all for it.” Rodger also identified as an “incel” and posted on forums populated by men with similar frustrations. The 22-year-old, who took his own life after killing others, became something of a hero to other “incels,” as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has noted. A man who killed 10 people by driving a van down a Toronto street in April identified himself on Facebook as part of the “Incel Rebellion.” Also on Facebook, he praised the Rodger, calling him the “Supreme Gentleman,” a nickname Rodger had chosen for himself. The man who shot and killed three women at a Pittsburgh gym, meanwhile, wrote on his personal website in 2008, “I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne – yet 30 million women rejected me – over an 18 or 25-year period.” “A man needs a woman for confidence,” he added. “He gets a boost on the job, career, with other men, and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a friend. This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded.” He also had ties to the pickup artist community, having purchased the book How to Date Young Women: For Men Over 35, and appearing in a video of one of author R. Don Steele’s lectures. Pickup artistry, more in vogue in the early 2000s than it is now, sometimes treated women as less human than men, as “targets” to be coerced or fooled into sex. It’s not murder, of course, but this was the climate of misogyny in which he planned his crime. Fighting hate crimes means understanding the communities that support them Each of these men may have seemed like a loner — but in fact, each was part of a group of people with similarly toxic views directed at Jewish people, women, or people of color. And we need to understand crimes like the Tallahassee and Pittsburgh shootings and the mailing of pipe bombs to Democrats within their larger context of on- and offline hate. That means holding platforms accountable for the behavior they allow. In the wake of the pipe bombings, Twitter has apologized for not taking Ritchie’s report more seriously. “We are investigating what happened and will continue to work to improve how we handle concerns raised by anyone on Twitter,” the account @TwitterSafety tweeted last week. But in response to a request for specifics from The Verge, the company merely pointed to blog posts from earlier in the year. “This is a familiar story from Twitter,” the Verge’s Andrew Liptak writes: “apologizing for reacting after the fact after it becomes clear that someone violated the site’s terms.” Gab, meanwhile, is being more defiant. “Gab.com is under attack,” read a message posted by the company on Monday. “We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh.” Investigating and prosecuting online threats can be tricky because perpetrators can conceal their identities and locations, and because when someone in one part of the country threatens someone in another, it’s not always clear which law enforcement agency should take the case. But there’s evidence that law enforcement, even at the federal level, isn’t doing all it can: The Department of Justice prosecutes only a small minority of cases of online threats and stalking, Joshua Eaton reported at ThinkProgress last year. A bill that would provide resources to help the FBI, DOJ, and local authorities fight such crimes, introduced by Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), has been stuck in committee since last July. While law enforcement can prosecute threats and stalking, other hate speech isn’t illegal. But that doesn’t mean companies like Twitter have to allow it on their platforms. As journalist Stacy-Marie Ishmael pointed out on Twitter, women, and especially black women, who experience disproportionate harassment online, have been warning of the seriousness of this harassment for years. Their warnings have mostly fallen on deaf ears. Taking online hate seriously would require platforms like Twitter to make fighting threats and bigotry a core part of their mission, not an afterthought. As Kate Klonick wrote at Vox in 2016, “Twitter needs to view fighting abuse as an essential feature.” It also means law enforcement, government, and ordinary users need to be aware of the ways in which online communities can fuel offline hate. Men like Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc have been posting about their violent intentions for years now, and getting support and affirmation for doing so.

It is a massive marketing opportunity for the NRA, with mammoth photos of its leaders hanging throughout the convention center, offers of discount membership, T-shirts and other swag for sale and booths set up to promote perks such as its wine club. AD AD There are seminars on firearm safety and Second Amendment law. And there is a major political element to the event, with the president and vice president this year asserting their support for an organization that since a February school shooting that left 17 dead in Parkland, Fla., has been directly challenged by students, activists, corporate America and politicians. About 80,000 people are expected to attend the meeting, which runs through the weekend. Some said they were here just to see guns and wanted nothing to do with politics. Others said they believe the minimum age to buy high-powered firearms such as the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle should be raised to 21, a proposal the NRA has rejected. Many said they wanted to come this year to show solidarity with the organization and affirm their right to bear arms, which many believe is threatened. They also want to loudly reject what they say is the assertion that anyone linked to the NRA is complicit in mass shootings. AD AD “It just makes me angry when people try to demonize gun owners and NRA members,” said Scott Glenn, a retired law enforcement officer from Salida, Colo. “They try to look at all of us like baby killers and we’re not.” Glenn and his wife, Lynn, have been NRA members for 18 years. Lynn Glenn is just getting into firearms and purchased a brown purse with a pocket for a concealed weapon. She roamed the floor to see what type of gun she might like to purchase and thinks she probably will get a .38 pistol. The couple sat at a table near a rack of .22 rifles in candy colors: red, purple and yellow. Scott Glenn is disabled, and he wants Lynn to learn how to shoot should the couple have to defend themselves. He thinks what many here said: Before additional gun-control laws are added, the ones on the books must first be enforced. His Second Amendment right, he said, is not up for debate or interpretation. AD AD “The Constitution says ‘shall not be infringed,’ ” he said. “What part of that don’t they understand?” In the main hallway of the convention center, attendees looked at the “Wall of Guns,” a case with firearms that were being raffled off. Red sirens flashed atop the case. “We’re giving away firearms! You could be our next winner!” a man said into a microphone. Tickets started at $20 and went up to $2,000. Orange cards from the Friends of NRA volunteer workshop sat on the case. “Join our team!” they read, with five questions that included, “Do you feel targeted as the bad guy?” Nearby, children and adults sat at an air rifle range, shooting air rifles and pistols at targets. “Did you shoot that thing automatic?” a man asked a boy of about 5, who was putting safety goggles into a bucket. AD For Brandon Theabold, firearms are a family affair. He and his wife have eight children between them, ages 8 to 21, all of whom are familiar with guns. He wore a T-shirt with letters constructed from guns, ammunition and the NRA logo that formed the word “coexist.” AD “This is tradition. It’s my heritage,” said Theabold, who traveled from Queen Creek, Ariz. “This is something we can do as a family. . . . It teaches responsibility, teaches safety, it teaches so many things.” For the Hendersons, attending was more of a political statement. The couple stood near a large-screen television, watching President Trump’s address to the convention on Friday. They applauded when he said that “Second Amendment rights are under siege” and called on members to vote Republican. AD “We do need to stand up. We do need to vote more Republican. We do need to get rid of the people who want to get rid of our rights,” Connie Henderson said. Art Manasse of McKinney, Tex., didn’t watch Trump’s speech. “I’m not really here for the political stuff,” he said. “I just wanted to see the show. It’s too much of a soap opera.” AD The meeting was just a half-hour drive, so Manasse popped down to check out the latest products and bought a mug and two T-shirts. One read, “Don’t stomp on my flag or I’ll stomp on your a--.” Manasse is a hunter, and he prefers to use a bow rather than a gun. He signed up for the NRA to stay informed about firearms, but he complained that the organization sends out too many fundraising solicitations, mail and emails. AD “Way too much mail,” he said. “Save a tree.” Dennis Stewart, of Dalton, Tex., spent 23 years in the Army. His opinions deviate from the NRA on a few issues. The organization stopped short of endorsing a ban on bump stocks, devices used by a gunman who killed 58 people at a Las Vegas country music festival in October to make his firearms behave more like automatic weapons. Stewart thinks bump stocks should be illegal, that civilian background checks should be as robust as those in the military and that the age to own rifles such as the AR-15 should be raised to 21, with exceptions for people in the military or law enforcement. AD “The drinking age is 21,” he said. “There’s no point in buying an AR at 18.” AD Across the hall stood a huge set for NRA TV, the organization’s media outlet, which broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and has become a staunch and open defender of the Second Amendment — against all perceived enemies. “I think they’re spot on and refuse to give up our rights,” Glenn said. Michele Rivera thinks NRA TV can be “a little aggressive” but that they are speaking to like-minded people. “To your average Joe, they’re going to look at that and say, ‘That’s crazy,’ because they don’t have the same mentality,” Rivera said. “This is how we feel.” Rivera and others said they are horrified by the recent spate of mass shootings. She believes that schools should be better protected with security measures such as armed guards. AD AD She was excited to come to the convention so she could meet up with people who have the same beliefs as she does; she said she feels as though there are not many where she lives in New Jersey.

I remember the heartbreak and anger so intense that I can feel it to this day, even knowing that it was never truly mine to feel next to the unimaginable grief of such horrific and senseless loss of life. Through the collective pain and talks of action, I had the distinct thought that no civilized society would ever tolerate the mass murder of its children in their own schools and that this would be the final turning point in our commitment to ending the plague of gun violence in our nation. ADVERTISEMENT Five years later, now completing my training as a pediatrician, I spend my career caring for children and working every day to assure their health and longevity. And yet, there is only so much I can do. After too many subsequent mass shootings and no meaningful change, my patients, their families and my own family remain in danger. We hear again and again calls for reasonable gun policy reform and “mental illness” uttered in the same breath. This apparent advocacy for improving mental health care seems fair- even though it has been clearly demonstrated, in countries such as Australia and Japan, that creating sensible gun laws is the only proven way to eliminate mass shootings and decrease gun violence- why not also work to solve the mental health crisis at the same time? What those who agree to mental health reform when it is proposed as a means of preventing mass shooting do not understand is how incredibly dangerous this tactic is. While well-intentioned, allowing for these topics to be discussed together is based on a series of problematic assumptions and leads to equally problematic results. First and foremost, there is minimal correlation between treatable mental illness and violent crime. In a study of 235 mass shootings, only twenty-two percent of the perpetrators could be diagnosed as having any degree of mental illness, with no proven correlation between this diagnosis and the horrific crime committed. Furthermore, less than one percent of gun homicides overall are committed by people with serious mental illness and there does not seem to be a higher rate of mental health issues in the United States compared to other nations, where rates of gun violence and mass shootings are exceedingly lower. What is true, rather, is that grouping-suffering individuals with mental health concerns, already stigmatized by society and with poor access to care, with antisocial mass murderers only creates further stigma. Most important to note is that after years of commitment to improving “mental health” spouted by legislators after each mass shooting, there has been no real change to our health-care system or increase in access, with the majority of those with mental health issues not receiving treatment and for those actively seeking help, 1 in 5 still unable to obtain it . It is apparent, then, that the cry for mental health access is a calculated distraction to replace a proven solution with an unrelated issue. When humanists, activists and especially physicians accept the false relationship between mental health and mass shootings, they perpetuate a lie that does a disservice to both causes. We, as doctors, must lead the way in rejecting this deception and promoting meaningful change on our own terms. This is a public health crisis that extends well past the realm of the political and in which every doctor must have a voice. As physicians, we must encourage all citizens who are angry, heartbroken, afraid and caught in a cycle of never-ending grief to see past the “mental illness” ruse and demand that our media and politicians address the real causes of and solutions to horrific and preventable mass shootings.

Gun rights protesters took to the streets over the weekend, many carrying semiautomatic rifles openly, to let the Boulder City Council know that a ban on their guns would not be accepted without pushback. What’s the story? The Boulder City Council passed the first reading of a city ordinance that would prohibit the sale and possession of “assault weapons.” The Daily Camera reported that the ordinance defines assault weapons as: All semiautomatic rifles that have the capacity to accept a detachable magazine and that have any of the following characteristics: a pistol grip or thumbhole stock; a folding or telescoping stock; or any protruding grip or other device to allow the weapon to be stabilized with the non-trigger hand. All semiautomatic centerfire pistols that have any of the following characteristics: the capacity to accept a magazine other than in the pistol grip or any device to allow the weapon to be stabilized with the non-trigger hand. Any firearm that has been modified to be operable as an assault weapon as defined by the city, plus any part or combination or parts designed to convert a firearm into an assault weapon. The idea for a ban came after the mass murder left 17 people dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. There were so many protesters outside openly carrying rifles that Boulder police declined to cite violators of city code, instead opting to provide “education” to demonstrators. Boulder code requires weapons carried outside to be kept in a case that is recognizable as a gun case. What are they saying? According to the Daily Camera, protesters had signs including “Gun Free Zones are Sitting Duck Zones” and “My Assault Rifle Self Identifies as a Personal Defense Weapon.” “We aren’t criminals,” said Brandon, one of the demonstrators. “I don’t think we should be turned into criminals.” “There ain’t nobody but me who is going to save me except myself,” said Vique DeJuliannie, another protester. “I’m not some right-wing nut job, either. “I just believe in my right to protect myself with whatever weapon I choose.”",Street Protest Flag of the United States Vehicle Pedestrian United States City Flag,"A protester in Boulder, Colo., on Saturday.","A proposed ban on assault weapons is moving through the Boulder, Colorado, City Council, and gun rights advocates are making sure their opposition is seen and heard, the Daily Camera reported.

Beierle, who killed himself on Friday after killing Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley and wounding five others at Hot Yoga Tallahassee, had filmed several virulently misogynist videos in 2014, according to David Mack, Amber Jamieson, and Julia Reinstein of BuzzFeed News. He had also uploaded sexist and violent songs to Soundcloud in the last few months. In the videos, Beierle rants about women who canceled dates or gave him their phone numbers even though they had boyfriends. He also mentions Elliot Rodger, the gunman who killed six people and wounded 13 in Isla Vista, California in 2014 — and who has become a hero to men who identify as “incels” (short for “involuntary celibate”). The Tallahassee shooting was the third crime in a single week that was apparently preceded by a trail of online hate. Robert Bowers, the man suspected of killing 11 people and wounding six others in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday, appears to have posted threatening language about Jewish people and HIAS National Refugee Shabbat, a refugee aid group formerly known as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, on Gab, a social network that has become a home for anti-Semitism and racism. Cesar Sayoc, the man arrested last Friday in connection with bombs mailed to CNN and several critics of President Donald Trump, appears to have threatened Democrats on Twitter and Facebook. “Hug your loved son,Niece,wife family real close everytime U walk out your home,” said one tweet sent to former Vice President Joe Biden, apparently by Sayoc. It included an image of Biden’s home with a target superimposed on it. The postings apparently made by Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were part of a pattern going back years. Elliot Rodger left behind a YouTube video in which he said women would be punished for not being attracted to him. And George Sodini, a gunman whose murder of three women at a gym outside Pittsburgh in 2009 appears to share similarities with the Tallahassee shooting, maintained a blog detailing his anger toward women for months before committing the crime. These men share more than their apparent online histories of bigotry. All were part of communities, online or off, that seemed to reinforce their views. That’s why online hatred and harassment is so serious. It’s not just that an individual person’s online posts can be warning signs of future violence. It’s also that hateful posts, even by those who never commit crimes, create an environment where those crimes are encouraged, accepted, and even celebrated. Many mass murderers and other criminals have left behind an online trail Beierle’s YouTube and SoundCloud history is rife with violent sexism. In one video, he says of a woman who canceled dates with him, “I could have ripped her head off,” according to BuzzFeed. In a song called “Locked in My Basement,” he describes holding a woman prisoner and raping her. He mentions Rodger in a video called “Plight of the Adolescent Male,” saying, “I’d like to send a message now to the adolescent males ... that are in the position, the situation, the disposition of Elliot Rodger, of not getting any, no love, no nothing. This endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration. That was me, certainly, as an adolescent.” Beierle had also been arrested in 2012 and 2016 for grabbing women’s buttocks without their consent, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. Meanwhile, posts apparently by Robert Bowers, the alleged Pittsburgh assailant, reveal a history of anti-Semitism, and a web of influences. On Gab, someone by the name of Robert Bowers posted a variety of anti-Semitic slurs and statements, including “jews are the children of satan,” according to the Associated Press. The same user criticized President Trump for being insufficiently anti-Jewish, and bragged about his gun collection, calling it his “glock family” and saying one gun in particular had an “amazing trigger.” As Vox’s Jane Coaston notes, Gab was started as a “free speech” alternative to Twitter, and allows forms of hate speech that are banned on more mainstream social networks. Because of this, it’s become a gathering place — and recruitment forum — for neo-Nazi groups. One post from a group called Atomwaffen Division features swastikas, racial slurs, and the invitation, “Join your local Nazis.” The synagogue shooting suspect also acted out of a specific kind of anti-Semitism, as Vox’s Dara Lind points out: “blaming Jews in America for bringing in an invasion of nonwhite immigrants who would slaughter the white race.” This particular kind of bigotry has been fueled by Trump’s claims that his political opponents are at fault for the caravan of migrants approaching the US, and by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists on Gab and other social networks, who have cast the caravan as a Jewish “invasion.” Most of the people posting this theory online have never committed anti-Semitic violence, but they helped create the conditions under which something like the Pittsburgh shooting could occur. Twitter and Facebook accounts connected to Sayoc contain threats against Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder, both of whom received pipe bombs. CNN analyst Phil Mudd also received a Twitter threat apparently from Sayoc. Political analyst Rochelle Ritchie reported a threat apparently from Sayoc to Twitter in the days before the shooting, but Twitter did not take action. Sayoc was apparently a devotee of a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which have spread on Twitter. As Vox’s German Lopez points out, he often posted criticisms of liberal billionaire George Soros, a common target of anti-Semitic fear-mongering on Twitter and elsewhere. Trump has fanned the flames of this fear-mongering, retweeting a claim earlier this year that Soros was a “nazi who turned in his fellow Jews.” Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were far from alone in leaving what appear to be online trails pointing to future violent behavior. “Tomorrow is the day of retribution,” Rodger said in his last YouTube video, according to the New York Times. “For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me.” “I do not know why you girls aren’t attracted to me,” he added. “But I will punish you all for it.” Rodger also identified as an “incel” and posted on forums populated by men with similar frustrations. The 22-year-old, who took his own life after killing others, became something of a hero to other “incels,” as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has noted. A man who killed 10 people by driving a van down a Toronto street in April identified himself on Facebook as part of the “Incel Rebellion.” Also on Facebook, he praised the Rodger, calling him the “Supreme Gentleman,” a nickname Rodger had chosen for himself. The man who shot and killed three women at a Pittsburgh gym, meanwhile, wrote on his personal website in 2008, “I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne – yet 30 million women rejected me – over an 18 or 25-year period.” “A man needs a woman for confidence,” he added. “He gets a boost on the job, career, with other men, and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a friend. This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded.” He also had ties to the pickup artist community, having purchased the book How to Date Young Women: For Men Over 35, and appearing in a video of one of author R. Don Steele’s lectures. Pickup artistry, more in vogue in the early 2000s than it is now, sometimes treated women as less human than men, as “targets” to be coerced or fooled into sex. It’s not murder, of course, but this was the climate of misogyny in which he planned his crime. Fighting hate crimes means understanding the communities that support them Each of these men may have seemed like a loner — but in fact, each was part of a group of people with similarly toxic views directed at Jewish people, women, or people of color. And we need to understand crimes like the Tallahassee and Pittsburgh shootings and the mailing of pipe bombs to Democrats within their larger context of on- and offline hate. That means holding platforms accountable for the behavior they allow. In the wake of the pipe bombings, Twitter has apologized for not taking Ritchie’s report more seriously. “We are investigating what happened and will continue to work to improve how we handle concerns raised by anyone on Twitter,” the account @TwitterSafety tweeted last week. But in response to a request for specifics from The Verge, the company merely pointed to blog posts from earlier in the year. “This is a familiar story from Twitter,” the Verge’s Andrew Liptak writes: “apologizing for reacting after the fact after it becomes clear that someone violated the site’s terms.” Gab, meanwhile, is being more defiant. “Gab.com is under attack,” read a message posted by the company on Monday. “We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh.” Investigating and prosecuting online threats can be tricky because perpetrators can conceal their identities and locations, and because when someone in one part of the country threatens someone in another, it’s not always clear which law enforcement agency should take the case. But there’s evidence that law enforcement, even at the federal level, isn’t doing all it can: The Department of Justice prosecutes only a small minority of cases of online threats and stalking, Joshua Eaton reported at ThinkProgress last year. A bill that would provide resources to help the FBI, DOJ, and local authorities fight such crimes, introduced by Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), has been stuck in committee since last July. While law enforcement can prosecute threats and stalking, other hate speech isn’t illegal. But that doesn’t mean companies like Twitter have to allow it on their platforms. As journalist Stacy-Marie Ishmael pointed out on Twitter, women, and especially black women, who experience disproportionate harassment online, have been warning of the seriousness of this harassment for years. Their warnings have mostly fallen on deaf ears. Taking online hate seriously would require platforms like Twitter to make fighting threats and bigotry a core part of their mission, not an afterthought. As Kate Klonick wrote at Vox in 2016, “Twitter needs to view fighting abuse as an essential feature.” It also means law enforcement, government, and ordinary users need to be aware of the ways in which online communities can fuel offline hate. Men like Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc have been posting about their violent intentions for years now, and getting support and affirmation for doing so.

Why wasn't he stopped?,"The police knew about his threats. The newspaper he assailed considered him a danger. And in tweets available for anyone to see, the man suspected of killing five at a Maryland newspaper this week broadcast his hate with a stream of invective. The failure to stop Jarrod Ramos, charged with five counts of first-degree murder for Thursday’s deadly rampage at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, shows the blind spots that foil law enforcement and internet companies — even as the social media gusher puts the warning signs in plain sight. “The terror and violence that we saw at Capital Gazette is another horrible example why our laws need to be updated to reflect modern-day crime,” said Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., who has been pushing for years to bolster federal online harassment laws and increase cybertraining for police departments around the country. Ramos, 38, posted harassing social media messages that alarmed editors at the newspaper and led police to investigate but fell short of leading authorities to pursue charges or Twitter to ban him. Twitter suspended Ramos’ account Friday. It declined to comment on it. Ramos’ grudge with the Capital Gazette dated back to a July 2011 article in which the paper chronicled his guilty plea for harassing a former high school classmate by email, phone and on Facebook. A year later Ramos filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper in a Maryland state court and later added a charge of invasion of privacy over the newspaper’s coverage of his conviction. The lawsuit eventually was dismissed, but that did not stop Ramos from launching a Twitter campaign in which he unleashed vitriol against the paper and its staff, including threats against the former staff reporter who wrote about his harassment conviction, Eric Thomas Hartley, and the retired publisher, Tom Marquardt. In one haunting tweet in February 2015, Ramos’ account said, “I'll enjoy seeing @capgaznews cease publication, but it would be nicer to see Hartley and Marquardt cease breathing.” Ramos' Twitter account featured journalist Hartley's picture as its avatar and included the tagline ""making corpses of corrupt careers."" On Hartley's forehead was an image inserted from the Japanese manga and anime series ""Berserk,"" which recounts the ritual murder of people marked with it. Ramos also placed the symbol on Marquardt's head. Since Nov. 20, 2011, Ramos mentioned in tweets @ethartley or his last name 107 times, Marquardt by name or as ""Evil Tom"" nearly 100 times and @capgaznews more than 50 times, according to a USA TODAY analysis. The account regularly attacked the newspaper and its journalists, including a reference to the deadly shooting at the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo in 2015. It had been dormant since January 2016. Shortly before the shooting on Thursday, it posted a message: “F--- you, leave me alone.” That was the same message it posted the day after the state’s second-highest court upheld a ruling in favor of the newspaper.

More:'Most dangerous person I've ever dealt with': Lawyer feared newspaper murder suspect More:Jarrod Ramos, suspect in Capital Gazette shooting, planned attack and blocked escape route Marquardt told the Capital Gazette that he called Anne Arundel County police years ago to express his concerns about Ramos' attacks on the newspaper and its journalists on social media. ""I was seriously concerned he would threaten us with physical violence,"" Marquardt said. ""I even told my wife: 'We have to be concerned. This guy could really hurt us.'"" Anne Arundel County Police Chief Timothy Altomare said that a detective was assigned to investigate the matter in May 2013 but that the newspaper ultimately declined to pursue criminal charges. ""There was a fear that doing so would exacerbate an already flammable situation,"" Altomare said. Some law enforcement experts questioned whether Ramos’ online posts crossed a legal threshold that would have allowed police to file charges. “His statements may be defamatory, they may be libelous, they may be obnoxious. … But the question is: Are his statements credible threats? In retrospect, it’s easy to say yes. But we have a lot of crazy people in this world saying things,"" said Peter Scharf, co-founder of the Gulf Coast Computer Forensics Laboratory and a criminologist at Louisiana State University. “You now have people saying, ‘Police should be patrolling the internet,’” Scharf said. “But really what’s here that would trigger a rational law enforcement intervention?” Twitter's scourge Online harassment has become an epic problem. Four in 10 Americans have personally experienced online harassment, and 18 percent of Americans said they have been subjected to particularly severe forms of harassment online, such as physical threats, harassment over a sustained period, sexual harassment or stalking, a 2017 Pew Research Center survey shows. The harassment happens on Facebook, Instagram or anywhere users can comment publicly on another's update. But Twitter, Ramos' apparent platform of choice, has long been dogged by rampant abuse problems. For years Twitter was reluctant to limit freedom of expression on the service. People don’t have to use their real names on Twitter. And with that anonymity has come racist, sexist and anti-Semitic taunts and attacks, as well as full-fledged campaigns from trolls, individuals or groups whose primary intent is to sow discord on social media platforms. Ineffective efforts to police that behavior have driven some users, including prominent ones, from the platform. Twitter now concedes it did not move quickly enough to curb abuse and harassment. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has pledged Twitter would work to make sure it becomes a healthier environment for users – at the same time abuse on Twitter intensified during and after the presidential election. The company has taken more forceful steps to curbing harassment, such as reducing the visibility of accounts that are disruptive or abusive, giving users new tools to block content they don't want to see, and beefing up training of employees who review harassment complaints from Twitter users. It's unclear whether the tweets on the Ramos account violated Twitter's rules. According to its terms of service, Twitter bans ""abusive behavior and hateful conduct,"" and it bans specific threats of violence of physical harm, death or disease. The threats have to be ""explicit statements of one's intent to kill or inflict serious physical harm against another person."" More:Twitter vows new crackdown on abuse after Harvey Weinstein boycott New tools to identify harmful behavior would not not have alerted Twitter to Ramos, whose account had been dormant for more than two years until Thursday, when he made a final menacing tweet. Before Twitter began using the new tools, an individual user would have had to flag Ramos' tweets as a problem. Even when users flag such abuse, Twitter has had a patchy track record of acting on the complaint. Facebook and Twitter are still not dedicating enough resources to content moderation and are not imposing stiff enough penalties on those who break the rules, fueling the behavior of online trolls, said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who studies social media. ""What we are seeing, too, is that online trolls know exactly the limits in content moderation, how far they can push things before content gets flagged,"" she said. ""Often aggressive comments fall short of content moderation language."" Police often lack tools, know-how Clark, the Massachusetts congresswoman, said the scourge of online harassment is further complicated by the fact that many law enforcement agencies – particularly small and midsized ones – have little capacity to train officers on how to investigate incidents. She has proposed legislation in the House that includes a $20-million-a-year grant to assist state and local law enforcement in cybercrimes training and a $4-million-a-year grant to establish a National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals that would provide departments technical assistance. On the federal level, prosecution of cybercrimes has been inconsistent, analysts say. Clark said cybercrime has simply been a lower priority for federal prosecutors. ""With the training of law enforcement, we have seen some progress. Indeed, there are prosecutors who specialize in online abuse,” said Danielle Citron, University of Maryland law professor who advises Twitter on safety. “But the gains have been modest, and online stalking laws remain seriously underenforced around the country."" Brianna Wu, a computer programmer who faced death and rape threats from supporters of a militant online movement known as Gamergate that targeted feminist criticism of the gaming scene, said the Capital Gazette massacre underscored that all stakeholders – law enforcement, lawmakers, social media platforms and their users – need to act. The FBI identified four men who sent threats of rape and murder to women, including Wu. The U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, however, declined to prosecute. “Everyone has a role to play – myself included,” said Wu, who is now running for Congress in Massachusetts. “We need to stop feeling powerless, and we need to start getting it done.” More:Capital Gazette gunman was identified using facial recognition technology that's been controversial Contributing: Bart Jansen",Rob Hiaasen Steve Schuh Capital Gazette shooting Annapolis The Capital Newspaper Journalist Shooting Murder Mass shooting,"A memorial for the victims of the shooting at the Capital Parade newspaper in Annapolis, Md., on Thursday.","The police knew about his threats.

(Reuters) - David Ortner adjusted his yarmulke, cocked his pistol and took aim - something he wishes a civilian had done to defend Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue three days ago when Robert Bowers walked in and shot 11 people dead. ""When this happens, you get a wake-up call,"" said Ortner, a 28-year-old owner of an optician shop in Monsey, New York. Ortner was one of nine Jewish men who attended a one-day course on Tuesday at the privately owned Cherev Gidon Israeli Tactical Defense Academy near Scranton, Pennsylvania, a class that was scheduled on Sunday in response to the Pittsburgh synagogue attack. He was there to learn how to use a gun to protect himself and his community and prevent a repeat of Saturday's massacre, the deadliest targeting Jewish people in U.S. history. ""The fact is, we're at war,"" said Yonatan Stern, a veteran officer of the Israel Defense Forces and director of the academy, told his class. ""We want every Jew in America armed."" In the six years since Stern started the academy, demand for firearms training had never been higher than after Saturday's attack. Hundreds of interested students contacted Stern in the last 72 hours. All but three or four were Jewish. The spike in demand follows President Donald Trump's statement that the shooting might have been prevented if the synagogue had employed an armed guard. But many Jews have resisted the idea that having guns in synagogues is the best way to prevent such attacks. Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of the Kansas Interfaith Action, an advocacy organization, said on Tuesday that he did not believe Trump’s call for more armed guards could prevent attacks on places of worship. “What kind of country we're going to be if every house of worship has to have an armed guard?” Rieber said. “I think having less access to that kind of weaponry is going to be much more effective in the long run than having a single armed guard.” Story continues According to Stern, an armed guard at a synagogue is a useful deterrent but not a replacement for armed civilians, since a shooter could kill the armed guard before entering and killing congregants. ""To wait for law enforcement to arrive simply is not the answer,"" Stern said. Some of the students attending the course were card-carrying National Rifle Association members. Some had never fired a gun before. Two worked in schools and wanted to defend Jewish children. Many of them intended to bring guns to their synagogues on the next Sabbath for protection. ""Everybody has to find a way to react; this is my way,"" said Zev Guttman, who said he was scared of guns until Saturday's shooting convinced him he had to be armed. Tuesday's course, held in a log cabin on an outdoor shooting range in rural Honesdale, about 300 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, consisted of active-shooter response drills using handguns and rifles. Students practiced drawing concealed weapons, loading and firing AR-15 rifles at bulls-eye targets. Stern said that it ""touches my heart"" to see his students in training because he knows they will return to their synagogues as a first line of defense.

(Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Jim Pernell says he's ready to move the family insurance business — it's just become too dangerous to have an office across the street from the Bethlehem Star Missionary Baptist Church. 'Your church has had many shootings here. That needs to stop,' he pointedly told the Rev. Roosevelt Watkins during a meeting called to talk about the latest attack there: six people shot while leaving the funeral of a local rapper slain in a gang shooting. """"My wife is sitting in a car (and) a guy is shooting alongside of her,"""" Pernell later complained outside the church. 'I’m pissed because it takes kids to get shot. This could have been prevented if this church had security out here because they know they have high-risk funerals."""" His remarks were among several tense moments at the meeting Tuesday night that drew 75 residents, activists and clergy to the church in the Burnside neighborhood on the South Side. They gathered to talk about an apparent ambush outside the church at 9231 S. Cottage Grove Ave. on Monday afternoon after the funeral for Vantrease """"Dooski Tha Man"""" Criss, killed earlier this month in a drive-by shooting. The most seriously wounded person Monday was shot in the head. The victims ranged in age from 18 to 27. At least four guns were fired during the attack, according to a police report, and as many as 50 shell casings were strewn across two blocks. Two funeral home limousines and at least one nearby home were damaged by gunfire. READ MORE: 6 shot while leaving funeral for slain rapper: 'Bullets flying everyplace' » Video surveillance shows three to five mourners pulled their own guns and returned fire, police told the Tribune, and at least one of the guns used was a rifle. Police have made no arrests. Gresham District Cmdr. William Bradley, who was the first officer to arrive at the scene, disclosed at the meeting that a police car had been assigned to cover the funeral but was dispatched to an emergency call. The shooting occurred after it left. Bradley said officers are now on alert to quell any gang retaliations. The tone of the roughly two-hour meeting, which also drew city and county officials, ranged from polite to boisterous as people responded with applause or cynical shouts from the pews. But despite the tensions, the shooting itself mostly took a backseat to issues familiar to those in communities that have struggled since the foreclosure crisis: poverty, single parenthood, lack of resources and few after-school options for at-risk children or former offenders. Watkins pressed those in attendance for solutions that could prevent the kind of attack that 'traumatized hundreds of people' on Monday. Chicago Police Sgt. Rocco Alioto speaks about at least six people shot after a funeral service in the Burnside neighborhood on the South Side on Monday afternoon. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) Chicago Police Sgt. Rocco Alioto speaks about at least six people shot after a funeral service in the Burnside neighborhood on the South Side on Monday afternoon. (Antonio Perez/Chicago Tribune) SEE MORE VIDEOS 'Tonight we called an emergency community meeting because we are family and the only way we’re going to fix a problem in our community, we have to take responsibility in our community,' Watkins said. 'Many of us know who the shooters are, we know what’s taking place in our community and we’re saying nothing about it.' Most in attendance were older adults, something not lost on some of those in the church. 'You notice what we're missing?' asked the Rev. Edward Jones, a Vietnam veteran who operates the small Now Is the Time Ministry in Hazel Crest. 'We're missing the youth,' he said, sparking applause from some who’d noticed their absence. 'You can't solve the problem, (if you can’t) find out what the problem is. We've got to deal with our young people.' After Jones spoke, activist Demetrius Nash talked about a generation gap where younger activists like himself feel they don’t have a voice or 'a seat at the table' with older community leaders. 'In the city right now, it’s not my child, not my problem. A lot of our elders are out of touch,' said Nash, 40, who said he walked more than 600 miles from Chicago to Washington, D.C., last year to protest gun violence. Linking generations could be the key to renewing the community, he suggested. 'Where your body is failing you, your wisdom, knowledge and understanding put in younger bodies will solve some of these problems. But in our community, it’s us against them.' There are other gaps, said Sandra Patterson, a real estate agent and president of the Cottage Grove Heights Community Coalition, who noted the tensions between longtime homeowners like herself and renters, some of whom live in public housing. As a result, a wall exists between the groups that has yet to be bridged, she said. 'The city created the problem because you don’t tear down the many projects within a city and expect this not to happen,' she said. 'You take down projects, but you do not teach people to be good neighbors."""" Several elected officials in attendance, including Ald. Michelle Harris, 8th, and County Commissioner Stanley Moore, blamed budget cuts for sapping resources from struggling communities. But a number of residents and clergy touted their own job training and education programs. Corey Brooks, pastor of the New Beginnings Church of Chicago, challenged the men in the room, especially those with professional pedigrees, to mentor boys. 'If every black brother in this room would start mentoring, we could solve a lot of issues that we face.' Some residents were pleased by the turnout of officials at the meeting, though they admitted they had become desensitized to the violence. 'It’s just, you get numb to it, you know,' said Barbara, a resident of a nearby community who wouldn’t give her last name. 'When we have shootings in our community, where if I hear it I just turn out the lights and get the phone.' But Pernell fumed in the church foyer, skeptical that anyone at the meeting, including his own alderman, would do anything to solve a problem that has plagued the church for months. In September 2017, a gunman fired near the church while it celebrated its 25th anniversary. A 17-year-old boy was shot in the leg and hobbled inside for help. A man inside the church was grazed in the head. Pernell called the meeting a show for television news cameras after an embarrassing spectacle. """"It’s a show, all they want to do is put on a show,"""" he said.

I remember the heartbreak and anger so intense that I can feel it to this day, even knowing that it was never truly mine to feel next to the unimaginable grief of such horrific and senseless loss of life. Through the collective pain and talks of action, I had the distinct thought that no civilized society would ever tolerate the mass murder of its children in their own schools and that this would be the final turning point in our commitment to ending the plague of gun violence in our nation. ADVERTISEMENT Five years later, now completing my training as a pediatrician, I spend my career caring for children and working every day to assure their health and longevity. And yet, there is only so much I can do. After too many subsequent mass shootings and no meaningful change, my patients, their families and my own family remain in danger. We hear again and again calls for reasonable gun policy reform and “mental illness” uttered in the same breath. This apparent advocacy for improving mental health care seems fair- even though it has been clearly demonstrated, in countries such as Australia and Japan, that creating sensible gun laws is the only proven way to eliminate mass shootings and decrease gun violence- why not also work to solve the mental health crisis at the same time? What those who agree to mental health reform when it is proposed as a means of preventing mass shooting do not understand is how incredibly dangerous this tactic is. While well-intentioned, allowing for these topics to be discussed together is based on a series of problematic assumptions and leads to equally problematic results. First and foremost, there is minimal correlation between treatable mental illness and violent crime. In a study of 235 mass shootings, only twenty-two percent of the perpetrators could be diagnosed as having any degree of mental illness, with no proven correlation between this diagnosis and the horrific crime committed. Furthermore, less than one percent of gun homicides overall are committed by people with serious mental illness and there does not seem to be a higher rate of mental health issues in the United States compared to other nations, where rates of gun violence and mass shootings are exceedingly lower. What is true, rather, is that grouping-suffering individuals with mental health concerns, already stigmatized by society and with poor access to care, with antisocial mass murderers only creates further stigma. Most important to note is that after years of commitment to improving “mental health” spouted by legislators after each mass shooting, there has been no real change to our health-care system or increase in access, with the majority of those with mental health issues not receiving treatment and for those actively seeking help, 1 in 5 still unable to obtain it . It is apparent, then, that the cry for mental health access is a calculated distraction to replace a proven solution with an unrelated issue. When humanists, activists and especially physicians accept the false relationship between mental health and mass shootings, they perpetuate a lie that does a disservice to both causes. We, as doctors, must lead the way in rejecting this deception and promoting meaningful change on our own terms. This is a public health crisis that extends well past the realm of the political and in which every doctor must have a voice. As physicians, we must encourage all citizens who are angry, heartbroken, afraid and caught in a cycle of never-ending grief to see past the “mental illness” ruse and demand that our media and politicians address the real causes of and solutions to horrific and preventable mass shootings.

Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr was fatally shot on Thursday night by a police officer who was responding to reports of gunfire at Hoover’s Riverchase Galleria near the city of Birmingham. Authorities said a Hoover police officer who was working as security at the shopping mall confronted an armed man running away from the scene and fatally shot him. Police initially said Bradford, who was known as EJ, fired the shots responsible for injuring an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl, but investigators have since said they believe he “likely did not fire” the shots. They said the gunman is still at large. Bradford's family has employed Benjamin Crump, who previously represented the families of shooting victims Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. In a press release, Mr Crump said Bradford was a veteran who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm. Bradford’s family said they were “completely shocked, heartbroken and devastated” by his death. “EJ was a devoted son and brother who dedicated his life to serving his country and always doing the right thing,” they said in a statement. “As we continue to grieve, rest assured that we are working with our legal team to determine exactly what happened and why this police officer killed our son.” Hoover police spokesperson Captain Gregg Rector said the police “regret” their initial media release was not “totally accurate” now new evidence has emerged. “Over the past 20 hours, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office investigators and crime scene technicians have interviewed numerous individuals and examined several critical evidentiary items,’’ he said. “New evidence now suggests that while Mr Bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim.” Story continues More than 200 demonstrators marched past Christmas shoppers on Saturday at the shopping centre where he Bradford was killed to demand justice. The protesters, who included several of Bradford’s relatives, chanted “EJ” and “no justice, no peace”. They held a moment of silence at the area outside a shoe store where Bradford was killed. “We knew that was false,” Bradford’s stepmother, Cynthia Bradford, said when she heard police were blaming him for the shooting. She described her stepson as a respectful young man whose father worked at a jail for the Birmingham Police Department.

The news comes just days after the massacre that left 11 people dead in a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh, but the company said its decision isn't related to the incident or any other mass killing. The NRA program is only one of the dozens of organizations that FedEx is moving to new pricing programs, the company revealed. FedEx said it has been quietly notifying customers of the changes by mail since early October. Why is the program ending? The NRA wasn't bringing in enough business to merit its own deal, according to the report. FedEx previously resisted in joining the mass exodus of major businesses with ties to the NRA after 17 students and faculty were murdered Feb. 14 at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Hertz, Enterprise, and others quickly severed ties with the NRA after the incident. But FedEx did not. ""FedEx is a common carrier under federal law and therefore does not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views,"" the company said in a statement, according to USA Today. It also said it supported a citizens' right to bear arms, as well as restricting so-called assault rifles to the military.

We would probably send in the military, and many people would demand the minority demographic hold their own members accountable. Does this happen when the suspects are white men? But in fact, we don't have to wonder — we can simply look at the actions of the Trump administration. It took far less for the government to send in the military to counter brown immigrants. Despite the fact that the allegedly dangerous migrant caravan has killed no Americans, the White House literally sent thousands of troops to block them, even initially suggesting American soldiers should have the right to shoot migrants who throw rocks. Meanwhile, gun violence has killed over 12,500 people in 2018 alone. The only real response from the White House have been strongly worded “thoughts and prayers.” Imagine, for a moment, if the suspects were from a minority demographic like Muslims or immigrants. We would probably send in the military. Worse, the White House still refuses to take meaningful action on gun control and has cut funding to counter right-wing terrorism, despite the epidemic and generational impact of white supremacists. For example, at least five of the 11 victims of what is believed to be the single worst attack on American Jews in history were born before 1945 — which means they were alive during the Holocaust. The domestic terrorist who targeted them was furious about, among other things, a Jewish organization that has worked to help Muslim refugees. But the Pittsburgh attack was far from an isolated occurrence of anti-Semitic violence: In 2017, America saw nearly a 60 percent increase in anti-Semitic violence over the previous year — the single largest increase in one year since 1979 when such data tracking began. “Many just see this an attack on the Jewish community,” said Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers. “It's not. It was an attack on America.” Get the think newsletter. This site is protected by recaptcha The rabbi’s wisdom is deep. In 2011, a white nationalist — not unlike the man who attacked the Tree of Life synagogue — attacked a Sikh Gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six Sikh Americans, thinking they were Muslim. In 2015, another white nationalist attacked the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, killing nine black Christians in what he described as an attempt to start a race war. In 2017, yet another white nationalist attacked a Quebec, Canada mosque, killing six Muslims during prayer. Meanwhile, in 2016, the FBI caught three white nationalists in Kansas as they plotted to bomb an apartment complex and mosque largely comprised of Somali Muslim refugees. Since the beginning of 2017, the Anti-Defamation league has tracked more than an astounding 900 incidents of white supremacist violence and propaganda incidents. Hundreds of incidents occurred on college campuses. If we think the problem is bad now, what happens in the coming years and decades when these young and impressionable minds become adults, influenced by hateful rhetoric and armed with semi-automatic weapons? Apathy, disunity, and America’s lax gun laws embolden these terrorists. Indeed, even Islamic State terrorists push their radicals to exploit America’s weak gun laws. Gun violence in America is getting so bad that survivors of other attacks are now getting killed later, in subsequent shootings. Borderline Bar in Thousand Oaks, California wasn’t just any bar. Some of the survivors of the Las Vegas shooting met for solace there after the Oct. 1, 2017 attack — by a white man — that left 58 dead. Telemachus Orfanos survived that Vegas attack, and was killed in the November 8 Borderline shooting. The solution, therefore, is purposeful action, a return to morality and a focus on unity. Purposeful action mandates commonsense legislation that ensures human rights are more important than gun rights. In a shocking interview regarding the Borderline shooting, Tennessee Senator-elect Marsha Blackburn remarked, “What we do is say how do we make certain that we protect the Second Amendment."" Her focus was on gun rights over human life. Notably, the NRA contributed $1.25 million to her campaign. What Blackburn fails to understand is that commonsense reform does not mean we strip guns from law abiding citizens, it means we make it more difficult for people incapable of safe gun use from acquiring them. Sen Marsha Blackburn on Thousand Oaks: “What we do is say how do we make certain that we protect the Second Amendment."" The @NRA contributed more than $1 million to Blackburn’s winning campaign.pic.twitter.com/B6nJ7BAtfk — Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) November 8, 2018 A return to morality mandates we recognize the root causes of mass violence, such as domestic violence. We know that many of the men who commit mass shootings have a history of domestic violence. The shooter in Tallahassee left a well-documented trail of misogyny behind; it is now being reported that the Borderline shooter has his own alleged history of violence against women. And, perhaps not surprisingly, it seems people intervened on his behalf to try and keep him out of trouble. Talk about white privilege. Moving forward, we must allocate more resources to educate young boys and men — and hold them accountable when they do hurt women and girls. And a focus on unity means that when one of us falls, we all help the fallen stand. In the days after the attack, the Muslim communities of Pittsburgh helped raise over $200,000 for the Tree of Life synagogue. In my ""ReSightIslam"" podcast we discuss how this is precisely in the spirit of the Qur’an 22:40-41, which commands Muslims to stand in defense of all houses of worship — including synagogues. This also means we resist outrage fatigue, a tall order as America’s 2018 mass shooting count has surpassed 300, according to organizations that track it. We must keep talking about these crucial events by remembering the victims, organizing for change and supporting leaders who push back against such violence and racism. No easy solution exists to stopping hate and extremism. There is no quick fix. However, by focusing on purposeful action, morality in countering violence against women and unity in the face of extremism, we can try to work towards a world where these attacks do not happen.",David Ian Long Ron Helus Thousand Oaks shooting Mass shooting Borderline Bar & Grill Shooting Gun control Massachusetts Murder Thousand Oaks,A memorial for the victims of the shooting in the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.,"Privilege is when, in a two-week span, white men kill 11 Jews in Pennsylvania, two black people in Kentucky grocery store, two women in a Florida yoga studio and 12 people in a California bar, yet no one calls to ban, deport, or profile white men — or asks, “Where were they radicalized?” Imagine, for a moment, if the suspects were from a minority demographic like Muslims or immigrants.

""We had this monster living under our roof and we didn't know,"" Kimberly Snead told the South Florida Sun Sentinel in an interview Saturday. ""We didn't see this side of him."" The interview with the Sun Sentinel is the first the Snead family has given since Cruz opened fire last Wednesday at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, killing 17 people. Their story aligns with what the family attorney, Jim Lewis, previously told CNN on their behalf. Cruz came to live with the Snead family, whose son was friendly with Cruz, after his adopted mother died last November. The family gave Cruz a home, enrolled him in adult-education classes and helped him get a job at a local Dollar Tree store, Lewis told CNN. The Sneads said that Cruz seemed depressed, but they did not sense, as others have said , that Cruz was someone likely to be a school shooter. ""Everything everybody seems to know, we didn't know,"" James Snead told the Sun Sentinel. ""It's as simple as that.""

""He was very naïve. He wasn't dumb, just naïve,"" James Snead told the Sun Sentinel. The family said that Cruz was not cruel to animals and seemed to love their two dogs and six cats. In addition, Cruz told the family he was set to inherit at least $800,000 from his deceased parents, most of which would come to him when he turned 22, the Sneads told the Sun Sentinel. On the day of the shooting, Cruz told the family he didn't need a ride to school, saying, ""It's Valentine's Day and I don't go to school on Valentine's Day."" Kimberly Snead saw Cruz at about 10 a.m. on the day of the shooting, with no sense of what was to come. Cruz texted with the Sneads' teenage son later that day and even asked him what classroom at Stoneman Douglas he was in. When the shooting began, the son managed to flee unharmed to a nearby middle school, according to the Sun Sentinel. 'He looked lost, absolutely lost' The Sneads allowed Cruz to bring his firearms into the home, but they made him buy a locking gun safe, they told the Sun Sentinel. James Snead thought he had the only key to the safe, but he now believes Cruz kept one for himself, he told the paper. They said they told Cruz he needed to ask permission to take out the guns. ""This family did what they thought was right, which was take in a troubled kid and try to help him, and that doesn't mean he can't bring his stuff into their house,"" Lewis, their attorney, told CNN. ""They had it locked up and believed that that was going to be sufficient, that there wasn't going to be a problem,"" Lewis added. ""Nobody saw this kind of aggression or motive in this kid, that he would ever do anything like this."" The Sneads told the Sun Sentinel that they crossed paths with Cruz at the sheriff's station as he was being led into the building in handcuffs after the shooting. Kimberly Snead lunged at him angrily before being held back by her husband. ""Really, Nik? Really?"" she yelled. ""He said he was sorry. He apologized.

The Second Amendment-loving couple appealed to their fandom by posting pix from a shooting excursion with Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., over the weekend. They both shared the same photo of the men holding guns with the former Fox News reporter in the middle, and then they put up additional shots of the president’s son holding and using his weapon. Guilfoyle, who is now working for pro-Trump super-PAC America First Policies, noted that she would have been shooting things up too — quipping that she’d be showing her boyfriend how things were done — but, alas, she’s recovering from hand surgery. (She recently injured her hand playing trampoline dodgeball with her son and Don Jr.’s kids.) As you can imagine, the comments are on fire. The couple definitely have their fans — and fans who love their gun pix (’merica!). But the majority of the comments are by people making fun of them — for their politics, for Junior’s love of shooting things, and for Guilfoyle’s shooting outfit.

Guilfoyle was happy to share her outfit credits either way: “Leggings by Varley.”) Photo: Kimberly Guilfoyle via Instagram More The weekend wasn’t all glamour shots with guns and trout in Big Sky Country, however. They were also “doing some politics,” according to Trump Jr. That meant attending the Ravalli County Republican Central Committee’s “Make Montana Great Again” event in Hamilton and taking turns addressing the crowd alongside Greg Gianforte and Matt Rosendale, who are both running for office in the state. (McCarthy is up for reelection in California.) This trip to Montana seemed better than a recent one to Bozeman, when a local bar and grill refused to host a campaign event by Trump Jr. Trump Jr., whose next divorce court hearing is Nov. 27, and Guilfoyle have been very open about their romance, but it doesn’t seem like they’re taking the next step anytime soon.

He also is the co-founder of Success Stories, an inmate-led rehabilitation program in the Correctional Training Facility in Soledad, California. He is featured in CNN's documentary, ""The Feminist on Cellblock Y,"" now available on CNNGo. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN) He killed his homeboy in broad daylight for calling him a bitch. Everybody I was in LA county jail with knew his story. The scariest part remains that most of them and many men I tell the story to today casually respond with something like, ""Well, I wouldn't go that far but yeah, I could see that."" Granted, most of the men I had this conversation with are in prison with me, but when 98% of mass murders are committed by men, and 90% of all murders are committed by men and 80% of those arrested for violent acts are men, it's safe to say there is something wrong with how our culture socializes men. Patriarchy is a social system that defines men as being inherently violent, dominant and controlling while rewarding them with power for being that way. It is no secret, especially these days, that we live in a patriarchal society. Why are we continually surprised when a man takes up arms and commits mass murder? Richard Edmond Vargas Cartoons, video games and contemporary politicians exalt male violence. This glorification echoes in our sports and movies. When the right person is performing it or it's being performed for the ""right reasons"" (think police officers or members of the military), people even call male violence heroic. So why wouldn't angry, entitled men seek to rectify their qualms with the world through unimaginable carnage? Every social cue they've received since childhood declared violence their birthright, it's what makes them real men. In my own life, I was taught by patriarchy that real men don't ask for help. And because of the ways that patriarchy is racialized I was taught that black men, like myself, were supposed to act in certain ways. Hardened. Shallow. Unaccountable. When I was 19, I followed this script and decided that committing robberies was an acceptable way to deal with the fact that I couldn't pay my rent. Though my girlfriend offered to help me pay it, I saw accepting a woman's help as weakness and decided to rob instead. That led to me being sentenced to 10 years in state prison.

The legislation, called the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018, was introduced less than two weeks after the mass shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school that left 17 people dead. The gunman used an AR-15 during the shooting, one of the many firearms that would be banned under the bill. Gun-control activists call the AR-15 an assault weapon while gun advocates dispute that claim, noting the AR-15 is not fully automatic and stands for Armalite Rifle — the company that developed the weapon. The Democratic legislation would make it “unlawful for a person to import, sell, manufacture, transfer, or possess, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, a semiautomatic assault weapon.” However, the ban wouldn't apply to semi-automatic weapons that were ""lawfully possessed"" when the measure went into effect. The bill also requires the attorney general to create a public record of semiautomatic assault weapons that have been used in crimes. ADVERTISEMENT Deutch had promised to introduce such a ban during a CNN town hall event last week. The new legislation is the latest attempt by Democrats to implement a ban on the guns since the Federal Assault Weapons ban expired in 2004.

Mr. Ryan’s claim reflects a common misconception. According to various polls, roughly half of Americans either believe that failing to identify people with mental health problems is the primary cause of gun violence or that addressing mental health issues would be a major deterrent.

One of the laws raises the minimum age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21. By signing the bill, Brown follows a move by Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott, the Los Angeles Times reported. In March, Scott signed into law a bill that raises the age for buying long guns. Other laws: Place a lifetime firearm bans on people convicted of serious domestic violence charges and for those who have been hospitalized more than once in a year for mental health issues. Make it easier for police officers and family members to have guns taken away from people who appear to be a danger to themselves or others. Require at least eight hours of gun safety training for people applying for concealed gun permits. They will also be required to demonstrate their skill through a live-fire exam. Brown vetoed a plan to limit people to no more than one rifle or shotgun purchase in any 30-day period, the report stated. What did the NRA say? The National Rifle Association fought the push to raise the age limit for purchasing guns. The measure boosts a previously-approved state law that limits handgun purchases to people age 21 and older, according to the report. “We will continue to oppose gun control measures that only serve to punish law abiding citizens,” NRA State Director Daniel Reid stated in a letter to lawmakers prior to the governor's signature on the bills. The NRA did not immediately say whether it plans to challenge the California law in court. State Sen. Anthony Portantino (D) authored California’s version of the law limiting long gun purchases to those 21 and older. The law takes effect Jan. 1. Portantino argued for the change by saying he was moved by the grief of survivors and family members of victims after the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. “I was determined to help California respond appropriately to the tragic events our country has recently faced on high school campuses,” Portantino told the Los Angeles Times. “No parent should have to worry that a gun gets in the wrong hands and commits a heinous and violent tragedy on our school campuses.”",KuToo movement Hillary Clinton Orator  Motivational speaker Argentine Workers' Central Union Unemployment Motochorro Psychology,Gov.

On the evening of Nov. 30, 2015, Adarius Montrells Sims of Birmingham, Alabama, was driving his gold Grand Am home. Tired after hanging out all night, he fell asleep at the wheel. The car crashed, and medics found Sims unconscious. After the crash, a police officer peering into the wreck spotted a .40-caliber pistol on the passenger-side floorboard. Police ran Sims’ name and saw he had two prior marijuana possession convictions, a record that made that gun illegal in Alabama. But Sims hadn’t hurt anyone, and his record was nonviolent. So he was sent to a gun court rehabilitation program, paying fines, and taking classes on anger management. While taking part in the program, he met with a federal agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, who told him that he could still face federal charges despite the local gun program he was agreeing to. “I had told him I was doing gun court, but he was saying they overrule all of that, and if they wanted me, they could get me,” Sims recalled. “But he said they weren’t going to. I don’t got a violent history.” Over the next two years, this apparent promise of discretion seemed to hold. No other charges from the incident were brought, and Sims began to move on. The father of two got a new construction job, and his girlfriend became pregnant. Sims had no idea, however, that hundreds of miles away in Washington, the new Attorney General Jeff Sessions was reversing the previous administration’s course on federal gun charges, which had dropped steadily throughout the Obama era. Focused on what he called the nation’s “rising tide of violent crime,” Sessions wanted to prosecute more gun cases to deter those he deemed most likely to commit violent crime: people with guns and felony records. In March 2017, only a month after assuming his post, Sessions announced his game plan. He ordered all federal prosecutors nationwide to prioritize firearm prosecutions, especially for illegal possession. Federal prosecutors would be evaluated by their commitment to such tactics, Sessions announced later that year, as part of a reinvigorated Department of Justice program, known as Project Safe Neighborhoods. A few months after his initial call to action, federal gun prosecutions ramped up by 23 percent. In the first half of 2018, attorneys who worked under Sessions took on more firearms cases than any previous administration in the same time period. This widened net eventually caught Sims. Sometime around May of this year, while working on a construction site, Sims got an angry call from his father. Federal agents had come to his father’s apartment looking for him. He didn’t know why. He cooperated and had them pick him up at work. Only then did he realize he was again facing charges, this time from federal prosecutors, for the same gun found in his crashed car more than two years ago. The next month, Sims pleaded guilty to felon gun possession. He will be sentenced in January on a charge that carries about five years in federal prison on average. (A local conviction for felon gun possession may only result in probation time, especially in states with permissive gun laws.) The punishment banishes “leading violent offenders” from their support networks and isolates them in long-term imprisonment. At President Donald Trump’s request, Sessions resigned from his post this month. But he’s left in place a formidable assembly line that transfers low-level gun cases from counties nationwide to federal prosecutors. That assembly line, which Sessions called his “centerpiece” crime reduction initiative, is still processing thousands of people across the country, with no sign of slowing. In his resignation letter, Sessions alluded to the program as one of his major achievements, boasting that, under his watch, U.S. attorneys “prosecuted the largest number of violent offenders and firearms defendants in our country’s history.” And most observers expect that this tough-on-crime model, which Trump praised during his 2016 presidential campaign, is likely to remain a DOJ priority. The initiative has federal prosecutors adopt ongoing gun cases from local police and prosecutors, or mine local court dockets for already adjudicated cases involving guns. The resulting federal sentences are generally longer and can send people to federal facilities far from home. The punishment banishes “leading violent offenders” from their support networks and isolates them in long-term imprisonment. The combined damage is supposed to serve as a powerful deterrent. Sessions explained the underlying logic during his Senate confirmation hearing. “Criminals are most likely the kind of person that will shoot somebody when they go about their business,” he said. “And if those people are not carrying guns because they believe they might go to federal court, be sent to a federal jail for five years, perhaps they’ll stop carrying those guns during that drug dealing and their other activities that are criminal. Fewer people get killed.” Despite Sessions’ departure, the data suggest that local law enforcement in certain parts of the country have responded enthusiastically to these calls. Since the Trump administration took office, federal prosecutors’ gun caseloads, adopted from cops and county prosecutors below, have risen to a rate never before seen. And, as with previous administrations, a majority of these gun charges are hitting black defendants. In fiscal year 2017, for example, 53 percent of defendants, convicted of felon in possession of a firearm, were black. Such disparities have held constant throughout the years. On the morning of Sept. 24, the ballroom of the Wynfrey Hotel in Hoover, Alabama, was packed with prosecutors. They had flown in from across the country to hear Sessions discuss his vision for combating violent crime. Sessions, who aggressively prosecuted gun cases during his stint as a U.S. attorney in Alabama, rallied the troops, insisting that their work was helping to combat the slight uptick in violent crime seen in 2015 and 2016. The indictments from the gun roundup, however, suggest that many of the defendants were stopped randomly for low-level infractions. “We’ve charged the most federal firearms prosecutions in a decade, and we’re not just putting people in jail, our efforts are bearing fruit,” Sessions declared, crediting the program for preliminary data showing a 2017 drop in violent crime. Seated next to Sessions that day was Jay Town, northern Alabama’s 45-year-old U.S. attorney. Like Sessions decades ago, Town has made a name for himself by zealously carrying out Washington’s gun prosecution agenda, an approach that regularly earned him the former attorney general’s praise. Of all 94 U.S. attorney districts nationwide, Town’s northern Alabama office is among the top 20 (raw and per capita) for the violent crime prosecutions Sessions prioritized in March 2017, 94 percent of which are gun cases. (Most of the districts topping the list are also in the South.) To achieve these numbers, Town has built a prosecution pipeline, routing cases from local law enforcement all across northern Alabama to his office. Last year, Town met with all 27 county-level prosecutors in his district and instituted a program streamlining the process by which county prosecutors can refer gun cases to his office. At the same time, Town has been working closely with the ATF, which has been taking over cases after local police encounter residents with guns and felony records. In May, for example, under the mantle of Project Safe Neighborhoods, Town announced the arrests and indictments of 71 people on gun charges, saying that local prosecutors had brought him their most serious gun cases. “We asked them to bring us their worst cases, bring us your trigger pullers,” Town told local media, which proceeded to publish the mug shots of numerous defendants, almost all black. The indictments from the gun roundup, however, suggest that many of the defendants were stopped randomly for low-level infractions. Town’s office published the names of 46 of the 71 people. But only a handful were charged federally because of gun offenses that indicated serious violent intentions, such as the production of a firearm silencer. Most cases stemmed from run-of-the-mill police operations, such as controlled buys, traffic infractions, or responses to residents’ calls about suspicious activity. Although many of these cases are low-level and sometimes based on random police encounters, Town has said that authorities are going after top targets, based on prior intelligence. “The defendants that we’re prosecuting, we’re not always going to get them for their worst offenses,” he said to local media in October. “But they are our worst offenders.” But several Alabama police officers and prosecutors working on the program with Town’s office told the Appeal that federal prosecutors seem to be accepting a wide range of everyday gun offender cases, rather than targeting select people. Christina Kilgore, chief deputy district attorney of Talladega County, said her office sends gun cases federal whenever an opportunity presents itself. If a defendant has a felony history and is caught for possession, she said in a phone interview, either local police will send it to the ATF or her office will refer it to federal prosecutors. “I don’t know what other factors anyone’s considering,” she said. “We don’t have an agenda as to which we’re picking and which ones we’re not picking.” Similarly, a police officer, who requested anonymity citing fears of professional reprisal, said that he sees his department referring all gun cases that they can to federal law enforcement authorities, like the ATF. “There are people who should never see the light of day again, but there are also people who made a mistake years ago but are law abiding and now need a gun for protection,” the officer said. “There’s no distinction between those two types. It bothers a lot of people in law enforcement.” This wide net is being cast, they say, because federal prosecutors have not given locals targeted guidance for when to send cases federal. According to one prosecutor, who requested anonymity because of being unauthorized to speak on the subject, federal prosecutors are just taking cases whenever it means more time. “Nobody has asked what’s the criteria for the ‘worst of the worst.’ ” The program is just “chasing numbers,” said another prosecutor, who requested anonymity citing fears of professional reprisal. “The message is ‘target,’ but what they do is ‘net.’ ” The Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment about these criticisms of Project Safe Neighborhoods. Sessions’ model for combating gun violence is premised on the idea that the fear of incarceration and exile will compel people to put down their guns. But the program’s design does not address the social conditions that cause people to carry, argues Andrew Papachristos, a sociology professor at Northwestern University whose work focuses on gun violence. The irony of the program’s target selection “is that the group most likely to be victimized is most likely to carry guns,” Papachristos noted. “You have to make people feel safer, that’s the reason these guys are carrying guns.” Living in public housing, Sims said he saw people getting robbed at night or caught in crossfire, and felt he needed protection. “Until I was grown, I didn’t need to have a gun,” he said. “I was a sports guy, but as I grown up and got kids, I needed to protect them.” Gun violence is concentrated in west Birmingham, the poorer side of the city that has an overwhelmingly black population. Several men with felony records in Ensley, one of the west side’s neighborhoods, told the Appeal that they understood the risks of carrying guns but choose to carry anyway because of the day-to-day dangers they face. Of all major American cities, Birmingham had the fourth-highest murder rate per capita from August 2017 to July 2018. Its murder rate during that period, 43.35 murders per 100,000 residents, is higher than New York City’s was at the height of the crack epidemic. And as of 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Alabama ranked second highest in the country for gun deaths per capita. Given this high exposure to violence, the threat of law enforcement punishment for gun possession did not register very highly to respondents. Less than 16 percent of gun holders surveyed felt that police were likely to catch someone for holding guns, or even shooting at someone. And even if they knew they were going to be arrested, only 27 percent said this guarantee of punishment would make them less likely to carry. The omission of this reality may help explain why the model’s effects on violent crime historically have been fairly minimal, argues Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, whose research focuses on policing. Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, concentrated federal gun prosecution programs were tried across the country with mixed results. One study on Richmond, Virginia, found that it possibly sped up a decline in gun murders in the early 2000s, while another concluded it had zero impact. A 2009 study of the first iteration of Project Safe Neighborhoods, which Sessions frequently cited in public speeches, found the program only produced a 4.1 percent drop in violent crime during its existence in the early 2000s. Despite these “small magnitude” results, Vitale argues, Sessions clung to the strategy because of a puritanical political vision, which demanded retribution against the criminal forces of lawlessness. “I don’t think they really understand the reality of why people carry,” said Vitale, referring to supporters of Sessions’ tough-on-crime approach. “They’re so committed to the Manichean worldview and deterrence-based understanding of human nature that the only way they can respond to the failure of their programs is to double down on them.” This bipartisan consensus on guns, however, has hurt people like Adarius Sims. Sessions got his first taste for harsh federal sentences against gun holders in the early 1990s as a federal prosecutor under President George H.W. Bush. Bush had won his election, in part, by tarring his opponent Michael Dukakis with the racist Willie Horton ad campaign, suggesting to voters that Dukakis was too lenient on black criminals. With violent crime rates at an all-time high, his administration’s federal prosecutors began prioritizing day-to-day drug and gun cases, shifting away from former focuses like civil rights and white-collar crime. Following Bush’s call to “take back the streets” from “vicious thugs,” Sessions ramped up gun cases, as the Trace documented, often hitting people simply caught for illegal guns or drug activity. Since the 1960s, federal administrations have consistently flaunted tough-on-crime initiatives to appeal to the fears and desires of white voters, notes Vitale. Sessions encouraged his allies to exploit the political value of such gestures for decades. In a 1982 memo to President Ronald Reagan’s attorney general, for example, Sessions pushed the White House to take on draconian anti-crime bills as a trap for its liberal opponents. “After they have come forth and identified themselves as sympathizers for drug smugglers and other assorted criminals, congregating about the bait, they should then be flattened by the President in a full-scale campaign on behalf of the legislation,” he wrote. “We support stability and order; they wander about wringing their hands crying for the criminals while violence everywhere escalates.” As attorney general, Sessions used similarly charged language when discussing violent crime and gun violence, frequently pitting “the law abiding people of this country” against the “violent thugs” and “poison peddlers.” Since the program’s launch, U.S. attorney’s offices across the country have held press conferences, announcing large-scale arrests and getting photos of guns and mug shots of black defendants published in local news outlets. The political dangers, on the other hand, seem to be minimal. Both gun rights and gun control advocates have publicly praised Sessions’ federal gun prosecutions. The National Rifle Association says it’s the best way to deter gun crime. The nonprofit Brady Campaign argues that prosecutors should hit illegal gun purchasers, in addition to other targets, like gun suppliers. This bipartisan consensus on guns, however, has hurt people like Adarius Sims. Sims says he tries not to think about the charges and keeps up his normal routine without telling many people about what’s happening. “I’ve been working, doing what I have to do,” he said. “I really don’t think about it. I pray every day. Leave it up to God.” Though the average punishment for his charge is about five years, Sims and his girlfriend, who doesn’t have a job, are hoping the judge will be lenient. “Hopefully they see my background and they keep me on probation, I’m hoping.” Though he faces sentencing in just a few months, he hasn’t talked to his kids about it. “They really won’t understand they’re so young,” he said. Sims insists he should not be considered one of the “leading violent offenders” that federal prosecutors claim to be targeting. Asked why he is now facing perhaps several years in prison, Sims said, “I don’t know, I really don’t know. … I’m not a ‘trigger puller’ or violent. I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”",Jeff Sessions United States Attorney General Lawyer United States Department of Justice Special Counsel investigation President of the United States Resignation Attorney general United States Senate CNN,Jeff Sessions in 2016.,"This story is being co-published with the Appeal, a nonprofit criminal justice news outlet.

That may have prevented a school shooting,"(CNN) Koeberle Bull got on Facebook and saw several racist, cruel messages that used the N-word and wished death on her three African-American children. She didn't know the white man who had messaged her -- she lives in New Jersey, and he appeared to live in Kentucky -- but he had a gun in his profile photo, so she decided to call police in Kentucky and report him. ""I was in shock, I was disgusted, I was angry and hurt,"" Bull said. Little did Bull know that her call, and a follow-up police investigation, prevented what police say could have been a mass tragedy. On Thursday, after speaking with Bull, Kentucky State Police went to interview Dylan Jarrell, the Lawrenceburg man who allegedly messaged her. Police say they found him backing out of the driveway with a firearm, a collection of ammo, a Kevlar vest and a detailed plan to attack local schools. ""This young man had it in his mind to go to schools and create havoc,"" state Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said. ""He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary, and the only thing that stood between him and evil -- between him in a school doing evil -- was law enforcement."" These harassing messages led Koeberle Bull to call police. Jarrell, 21, was arrested and charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications, police said. His public defender, Amy Robertson, would not comment on the specifics of the allegations. ""These cases are very complex and often have many sides to them. It is not uncommon for it to take a long time for all the facts to come out,"" Robertson said. ""I ask that you not jump to any conclusions and give me time to do my job."" Questioned over alleged threats to a school Police said they found evidence of a ""credible and imminent threat"" to nearby Shelby and Anderson County schools. Authorities said they obtained a search warrant for Jarrell's home and electronic devices. Jarrell's internet history included a search for how to carry out a school shooting, police said, and the FBI questioned him in May over social media threats to a school in Tennessee. Kentucky State Police said Jarrell had more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a 100-round high capacity magazine and a detailed plan of attack. There may be additional charges, Sanders said. Court records indicate Jarrell was arraigned Monday and entered a not guilty plea with Robertson. His bond was set at $50,000. Jarrell is being held at the Shelby County Detention Center and has a preliminary hearing in Anderson County scheduled for November 1, according to court records. 'I didn't know what he was capable of' Police say Dylan Jarrell had a weapon, ammo and a detailed plan to attack Kentucky schools. Before she called police, Bull posted a screen grab of the racist message on Facebook. ""Anyone who thinks racism doesn't exist, this is what I woke up to in my inbox this morning,"" she said in her post. ""Let's share this and make this guy famous please."" She tried to message Jarrell but he had blocked her, she said. With help from her friends she was able to find him and call police -- first in her hometown and then in Kentucky. Now, days later, Bull's Facebook page is full of messages of praise, thanking her for preventing what could have been a tragedy. ""People are reaching out and calling me a hero and calling me a guardian angel, but I was just being a mom,"" she said. ""I was just being a mom who wanted to protect her kids."" As a precautionary measure, Anderson County Schools were closed on October 19, and Shelby County Public Schools suspended activities at Shelby County High School, too. On the Anderson County Schools website , officials thanked security officials and first responders ""who eliminated a threat to AC students and staff, worked countless, tireless hours to ensure our safety and humbly take no credit for their heroic actions."" At a press conference, Sanders thanked Trooper Josh Satterly, a ""humble, dedicated trooper"" who took Bull's report and followed up with other agencies to investigate. Bull said she is grateful that Satterly validated her concerns, despite her suspicion that her call would lead nowhere. ""I thought, 'they're not gonna care about my three black kids from New Jersey,' and this community genuinely did care about my kids,"" she said. ""If you see something, say something -- I never took that as seriously as I do now, and now I know that it matters,"" she said.

Born in Venezuela, he had just received his American citizenship. He was about to begin his senior year of high school. A year later, his friends and family stood outside the National Rifle Association headquarters in Fairfax County, Virginia, surrounded by hundreds of protesters and sang ""Happy Birthday"" through waves of tears. Joaquin was one of the 17 people killed in a February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. His 18th birthday would have been Saturday. ""I don't know what the right way is to celebrate today,"" said his sister, Andrea Ghersi, 26, after the crowd had dispersed. ""There's nothing I can do that will make today feel okay. He should have been here. He should be here."" The birthday tribute served as the emotional climax to a rally that brought hundreds to the doorstep of the NRA, demanding stricter gun laws and the revocation of the gun group's nonprofit status. They were met with dozens of counterprotesters, some of whom arrived with guns strapped to their hips or across their chests. The protest, which was organized by a coalition of anti-gun-violence organizations, included survivors of gun violence from around the country - though the headliners were students from Stoneman Douglas. They have been touring the country registering young people to vote and raising awareness about gun violence. Organizers, who dubbed the protest the National March on the NRA, said they were there for multiple reasons: to confront the NRA and condemn the lobbying efforts of the group, and to make demands of local and federal lawmakers who may be watching. Their demands include instituting universal background checks of gun buyers through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System and banning high-capacity magazines and ""any weapon of a caliber higher than .30-caliber or more and any rifle, long gun, or short-barreled rifle that fires in semi-automatic and takes self-loading magazines,"" according to a website for the march. They also called for a searchable database of gun owners through the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The NRA did not respond to a request for comment. Though police separated the groups, placing thick orange barricades and a chunk of space between them, several activists said they came to Saturday's rally to engage the other side and have a conversation. ""When you're just yelling at each other, nothing is going to change and no one is going to change their minds,"" said Lindsey Nystrom, 18, who carried a sign listing NRA contributions to prominent Republican lawmakers. ""It's such a different energy when you take the time to really listen and have a conversation. That's why we came today. That's what we wanted."" She and her sister, Grace Nystrom, 16, spent much of the day speaking to NRA members and gun owners who milled around on their side of the barricades. Wade Guzman, 31, of Aberdeen, Maryland, had similar motivations - he wanted to engage people on the other side of the gun debate. So he stood with the student protesters and their supporters, refusing to move to the other side of the barricades where his fellow pro-gun activists were corralled. With his 9mm gun strapped to his hip, Guzman greeted passersby with a smile and a hand-drawn sign that challenged people to ""disarm"" their expectations and assumptions. Though he's a gun owner, Guzman is not a member of the NRA. He grew up near Parkland, and felt personally affected by the attack on students there. But he said he doesn't believe stricter gun laws will fix the problem. ""We can find middle ground if we work together and see past what we assume about each other,"" he said. ""People look at me and they think they know all about who I am and what I believe. But they would probably never guess that my parents came here illegally from Guatemala, my sister is married to a black woman, I personally disagree with the Muslim ban - there's a lot you can learn when you just talk to people,"" Guzman said. ""I'm here because I'm trying to hear them. I'm trying to be sensitive and help them hear me, too,"" he said. Several counterprotesters said they support better enforcement of existing gun laws, broader mental-health checks and safety training for gun owners. But they dismissed attacks on specific firearms, such as the AR-15, which was used in the Parkland attack. Despite the occasional heated exchange, the event remained peaceful. Fairfax County police Lt. Eli Cory said one arrest was made. A man, crossing from the counterprotesters' side, was charged with unlawfully crossing a police barrier. Similar ""sister marches"" took place in nearly two dozen cities, where marchers were expected to target local guns groups or state legislatures. Outside the NRA headquarters, a pile of sunflowers was left beside a mural that Joaquin's father, Manuel Oliver, created to honor his slain son. He had painted the teen's face, framed by 18 small flames and the words: ""We demand to blow out our candles."" Then, with a hammer, he struck a hole through each flame, blowing them out.",Parkland March for Our Lives Stoneman Douglas High School shooting National Rifle Association  Crowd Image Birthday Protest,"A protester was carried into the crowd after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Saturday.","Joaquin Oliver's 17th birthday was celebrated with a surprise party - a gathering of nearly 50 friends and family who packed his house in Florida.

549,549,444,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/08/06/americas-active-shooter-problem-blown-out-proportion-column/826571002/,America's increasing moral panic over active shooters is overblown and counterproductive,"James Alan Fox Opinion columnist Reports that there was an active shooter barricaded inside an Ohio military hospital Thursday sent employees scurrying for safety as teams of first responders rushed to the scene. News of the crisis spread quickly throughout the national media and the Twittersphere. By the time officials gave the “all clear,” it became apparent that a planned active shooter training exercise had been mistaken for the real thing. Although actual active shooter events can be devastating, the level of fear associated with this modern-day boogeyman is out of control, leading to countless false alarms: ►An unfounded report of an active shooter inside a California hospital Wednesday prompted a “code black” lockdown of the facility and a massive police response. ►An attempted robbery of a jewelry store on July 28 inside a Texas mall created havoc when the sound of breaking glass was mistaken for an active shooter event, sending terrified shoppers rushing for the exits. ►As fireworks lit up the sky above Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, last July Fourth, word spread through the crowd that there was an active shooter among them, sending thousands running for their lives. However, there was no shooting and no gunman — just folks misinterpreting the sound of firecrackers. Satanic cults, child abductions by strangers, pedophile daycare workers — all were at some point considered threats of some magnitude, albeit small. Yet, in classic moral panic fashion, frightened Americans overstated the risk and embraced overresponse. Of course, anyone who sits in a classroom or at his desk at work, or who visits a shopping mall or restaurant, faces the possibility of confronting an armed assailant. But the likelihood is akin to that of being killed by lightning. How did we get to the point where the term “active shooter,” a relatively recent addition to our lexicon, reflects a menace of intense concern? In recent years, the FBI has produced a series of reports on active shooter events, dispelling a number of common misconceptions. For example, the latest update indicated that, contrary to what many believe, active shooters are generally not driven by serious mental illness. Moreover, they tend to target specific victims as opposed to shooting indiscriminately. Are there really more active shooters? The FBI statistics remain dubious, however, in terms of the reported increase over the past two decades, which has many observers thinking in epidemic terms. According to the FBI database, partially assembled by accessing news archives, the number of active shooters — defined as a gunman “actively engaged in killing or attempting to kill people in populated areas” — grew from one case in 2000 (the massacre of seven employees in Wakefield, Massachusetts) to an average of dozens over the past few years. Is the increase in actual cases or in the ability to locate cases from years gone by, especially when the press was not so vigilant in reporting on armed assailants who, despite their intentions, failed to kill lots of people? It is hard to fathom that in 2000, there was not more than one person in this entire nation who picked up a loaded gun with the desire to kill many people in a public place. Actually, there was, among others, a Pittsburgh man who killed five in a hate-inspired rampage. He just didn't make the FBI database. More:Mom of school shooting hero says she 'would hug' the shooter's parents After Texas school shooting, how can we inoculate ourselves against the next one? Danger in overreacting to Santa Fe school shooting In the four years since the FBI began surveying active shooter events, 27 percent of assailants failed to kill anyone. In the first four years of the FBI database (2000-03), only 9 percent killed no one. Either active shooters of recent vintage are poorer marksmen, or the less serious cases of earlier years were not identified. The other factor driving misperceptions of risk is the over-the-top news coverage. As in the recent episode at YouTube headquarters, as soon as the 911 calls arrive, satellite trucks and helicopters are dispatched to the scene transmitting live images into living rooms across America. Our fear doesn't match the level of risk As a result, the level of fear is well out of proportion with the risk. For example, a recent poll of residents of Anne Arundel County, Maryland, found that two-thirds feared that an active shooter would strike at a local school. Sadly, there was indeed an attack, but instead of striking a school as residents feared, he struck the very newspaper that published the survey results. Although fear can sometimes encourage taking reasonable precautions, in the case of moral panics, the steps are often useless, of questionable value, or even counterproductive. Consider these examples: ►Some schools, despite limited budgets, are purchasing active shooter insurance in case of liability. ►For school teachers, a few hours of training at a shooting range and simulated exercises hardly qualifies them to be prepared sufficiently for the real thing. ►It is debatable whether active shooter drills in schools and workplaces really help, but they certainly can arouse fear. The message is: “We wouldn’t be doing these drills were we not in real danger.” Inadvertently, the drills can also inform a disgruntled student or employee of the best attack strategy. ►In 2016, Michigan established an active shooter alert system patterned after the Amber Alert. Unlike kidnappers, active shooters rarely venture very far or remain active for long. Widely broadcasting an alert could do more to frighten than protect citizens. Overall, the most significant downsides to our hypervigilance are the constant reminder of danger and the possibility of false alarms. Plus, the more we obsess over active shooters, the more we entice angry individuals to seek redress with a gun.

Public outrage over the shooting deaths of 17 Florida high school students and faculty last month is bringing pressure on the gun industry from institutional investors. But whether that pressure will result in real change -- on society or the financial industry -- is unclear. States like New Jersey are moving toward divesting their pension funds of gun stocks, a move that CalPERS (the California Public Retirement System) made in 2013 following the school shootings in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Meanwhile, investment companies BlackRock and Vanguard have been putting heat on gun manufacturers. Black Rock is now giving investors the option of opting out of gun stocks in some funds, and Vanguard, which has long offered gun-free funds, has been in discussions with manufacturers. But neither company has declared an outright ban on investing its clients’ money in firearms and there’s a good reason for this. These two companies are the largest purveyors of passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors have been putting heat on gun manufacturers, but whether that pressure will result in real changes is unclear. Alex Quesada/Polaris Regardless of an investment company’s sensitivity to social opposition of guns, there’s a functionality problem with divesting all funds of gun-related investments. To be an S&P 500 index fund, such a fund must hold stocks from that entire index. And while gun manufacturers tend to be small companies, some of the retail companies that sell firearms are huge -- notably, Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart. Since the Feb. 14 school massacre in Parkland, Florida, both retailers have stopped selling assault rifles and raised the age for gun purchases to 21. Even if investment companies feel pressure to eliminate any trace of guns from their offerings, it would be impossible to keep the stocks of major retailers selling them out of all index funds and ETFs. Because they’re relatively small public companies, gun manufacturers could be viewed as easier financial targets than some past targets of SRI (socially responsible investing) movements—most notably, the tobacco industry. CalPERS got wound up about tobacco more than a decade ago, but didn’t end up fully divesting. People comfort each other at a public memorial for the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla., Feb. 16, 2018. Gerald Herbert/AP Pension funds have a different problem. They’re required to get the best returns for investors. Generally, the view in that industry is: If that means guns, then so be it. CalPERS, the largest public or private pension fund with more than $300 billion in assets under management, has the flexibility to snub guns because its size confers enough investment clout to open up many options. But most pension funds, especially private ones without the public policy accountability, don’t have this kind of flexibility. It came out soon after the Parkland shooting that teacher pension funds in 12 states own stocks in gun manufacturers. These states include Florida and California (where teachers have a separate fund from other public employees). Doubtless, there will be at least some divestiture by these funds, but generally, anti-gun pressure on the financial services industry will have to be sustained to make a lasting difference on society and on the financial services industry. This would be a departure from past patterns of waning public and investor attention as the focus on mass shootings fades until the next one unfortunately occurs.

97,97,131,https://www.yahoo.com/news/dispute-over-3d-printed-guns-223738462.html,Dispute over 3D-printed guns raises many legal issues,"A little-known dispute over 3D-printed guns has morphed into a national legal debate in the last week, drawing attention to a technology that seems a bit of sci-fi fantasy and — to gun-control advocates — a dangerous way for criminals to get their hands on firearms that are easy to conceal and tough to detect. The gun industry calls the outcry an overreaction that preys on unwarranted fears about a firearm that can barely shoot a round or two without disintegrating. It also raises a host of constitutional questions involving First Amendment protections for free speech and Second Amendment rights to own guns. Here are some questions and answers about the debate: Q. What is behind the dispute? A. Cody Wilson, the founder of Texas-based Defense Distributed, first posted downloadable blueprints for a handgun called the Liberator that could be made using a 3D printer in 2013. Within days it had been downloaded about 100,000 times until the State Department ordered him to cease, contending it violated federal export laws since some of the blueprints were saved by people outside the United States. The dispute between Wilson and the federal government went on for years until this past June when they reached a settlement that paved the way for Wilson to resume posting the designs. The State Department decision came amid an obscure administrative change — begun under the Obama administration — in how the weapons are regulated and administered. Military grade weapons remain under the purview of the State Department, while commercially available firearms fall under the Commerce Department. The settlement with Wilson determined that 3D-printed firearms are akin to more traditional firearms that aren't subject to State Department regulations. Wilson resumed sharing his blueprints for the gun the day the settlement went into effect last week. Q. Why does Wilson want the authority to post the designs on his website? A. Wilson calls it a First Amendment issue. He believes the First Amendment gives him a constitutional right to disseminate the code to make a gun with a 3D printer. Story continues ""This is a very, very, very easy First Amendment question that I think people might be hesitant to accept because it involves guns and people don't like guns,"" said his lawyer, Josh Blackman. And Wilson has a strong legal claim that distribution of the information is different than actually making an all-plastic firearm. While it is a violation of the federal Undetectable Firearms Act to make, sell or possess a firearm that can't be detected by magnetometers or metal detectors, what Wilson is doing is simply providing the information on how to make such a firearm. ""What Defense Distributed was doing was not making and then shipping the weapons overseas,"" said Chuck James, a former federal prosecutor who is now a private lawyer with the Washington, D.C.-area firm of Williams Mullen. ""They were making the data available on the Web where it would be available to someone overseas."" Q. What kind of gun designs are available on the website? A. Defense Distributed shows a variety of designs. The code for a 3D printed gun is for what he calls the Liberator, which gets its name from a pistol American forces used during World War II. His design includes a metal firing pin and a metal block. His site also includes blueprints to make various AR-platform long guns and some other handguns using more traditional means and materials. Q. Are 3D printed guns legal? A. In 1988, the U.S. enacted the Undetectable Firearms Act, making it illegal to manufacture, sell, or possess a firearm that couldn't be detected by a metal detector. That law has been renewed several times by Congress and remains in effect. If 3D printed guns contain enough metal to be flagged by a metal detector, they are considered legal under U.S. law. Gun-control advocates argue that the risks are too great to allow 3D printed guns because even if they're designed to include metal, it's too easy for someone to not include those pieces or to remove them to skirt detection. ""It's an absurdity. You can take the piece of metal out and put it back in at your own whims and you can take it out and walk through a metal detector undetected,"" said Jonas Oransky, legal director for Everytown for Gun Safety. Q. How well do 3D printed guns work? A. Gun experts and enthusiasts recoil at the suggestion that a 3D printed gun is a true threat, calling the firearms mere novelties. Unlike traditional firearms that can fire thousands of rounds in their lifetime, 3D-printed guns are notorious for usually lasting only a few rounds before they fall apart. They don't have magazines that allow the usual nine or 15 rounds to be carried; instead, they usually hold a bullet or two and then must be manually loaded afterward. And they're not usually very accurate either. A video posted of a test by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in 2013 showed one of the guns produced from Wilson's design — the Liberator — disintegrating into pieces after a single round was fired. ""People have got this Star Trek view"" of the guns being futuristic marvels, said Chris Knox, communications director for The Firearms Coalition, a gun-rights group. ""We're not talking about exotic technology."" Others are quick to point out that normal guns are readily available in the U.S. with little regulation, making 3D-printed guns a major hassle compared with regular weapons. Q. What's the status of the debate? A. A federal judge on Tuesday issued a temporary restraining order blocking Wilson from continuing to post the designs on his site. A hearing is to be held in that case next week. In the meantime, President Donald Trump criticized the Department of Justice advising the State Department to reach a settlement with Wilson without first consulting with him.

Jeffrey Ziegler, 53, was found guilty on charges of assault with attempt to murder and possession of a firearm in commission of a felony for shooting at 14-year-old Brennan Walker in April. Ziegler could face up to life in prison. His bond has been revoked and he is in custody awaiting sentencing. What happened? On April 12, Walker missed the morning school bus. Left without options, he attempted to walk to school. Problem is, he didn't quite know the way. So, as Walker wandered through an unfamiliar neighborhood, he decided he needed to try to get some directions. He ended up knocking on the door of a house belonging to Ziegler and his wife. Ziegler's wife answered the door, and apparently thought Walker was attempting to break into the house. She called 911, and Ziegler came to the door and chased Walker away from the house with a loaded shotgun. Walker fled, and security footage shows Ziegler running out of the house with the gun pointed. After Walker is off camera, Ziegler fires one shot in Walker's direction, which fortunately missed. Walker was surprised by the couple's reaction to him knocking on their door. ""I knocked on her door a few times and she came down yelling at me before I could say anything and she thought I was trying to break into her house,"" Walker told WXYZ-TV at the time. ""I was trying to explain to her that I wanted to get directions to go to my school. I told her, 'No, I go to Rochester High; I'm just looking for directions to Rochester High.'"" Security footage tells the story Ziegler claimed in court that there was ""a lot more to the story than what's being told,"" but the home security footage clearly shows Walker's knock being met with Ziegler's armed threat and eventually a shotgun blast.

I remember the heartbreak and anger so intense that I can feel it to this day, even knowing that it was never truly mine to feel next to the unimaginable grief of such horrific and senseless loss of life. Through the collective pain and talks of action, I had the distinct thought that no civilized society would ever tolerate the mass murder of its children in their own schools and that this would be the final turning point in our commitment to ending the plague of gun violence in our nation. ADVERTISEMENT Five years later, now completing my training as a pediatrician, I spend my career caring for children and working every day to assure their health and longevity. And yet, there is only so much I can do. After too many subsequent mass shootings and no meaningful change, my patients, their families and my own family remain in danger. We hear again and again calls for reasonable gun policy reform and “mental illness” uttered in the same breath. This apparent advocacy for improving mental health care seems fair- even though it has been clearly demonstrated, in countries such as Australia and Japan, that creating sensible gun laws is the only proven way to eliminate mass shootings and decrease gun violence- why not also work to solve the mental health crisis at the same time? What those who agree to mental health reform when it is proposed as a means of preventing mass shooting do not understand is how incredibly dangerous this tactic is. While well-intentioned, allowing for these topics to be discussed together is based on a series of problematic assumptions and leads to equally problematic results. First and foremost, there is minimal correlation between treatable mental illness and violent crime. In a study of 235 mass shootings, only twenty-two percent of the perpetrators could be diagnosed as having any degree of mental illness, with no proven correlation between this diagnosis and the horrific crime committed. Furthermore, less than one percent of gun homicides overall are committed by people with serious mental illness and there does not seem to be a higher rate of mental health issues in the United States compared to other nations, where rates of gun violence and mass shootings are exceedingly lower. What is true, rather, is that grouping-suffering individuals with mental health concerns, already stigmatized by society and with poor access to care, with antisocial mass murderers only creates further stigma. Most important to note is that after years of commitment to improving “mental health” spouted by legislators after each mass shooting, there has been no real change to our health-care system or increase in access, with the majority of those with mental health issues not receiving treatment and for those actively seeking help, 1 in 5 still unable to obtain it . It is apparent, then, that the cry for mental health access is a calculated distraction to replace a proven solution with an unrelated issue. When humanists, activists and especially physicians accept the false relationship between mental health and mass shootings, they perpetuate a lie that does a disservice to both causes. We, as doctors, must lead the way in rejecting this deception and promoting meaningful change on our own terms. This is a public health crisis that extends well past the realm of the political and in which every doctor must have a voice. As physicians, we must encourage all citizens who are angry, heartbroken, afraid and caught in a cycle of never-ending grief to see past the “mental illness” ruse and demand that our media and politicians address the real causes of and solutions to horrific and preventable mass shootings.

625,625,10131,http://thehill.com/regulation/368425-planned-shift-on-gun-exports-kicks-up-storm,Planned shift on gun exports kicks up storm,"The Trump administration’s expected plan to transfer the licensing of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department has Democratic lawmakers and foreign policy advocates readying for a fight. The proposal under review by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has yet to be made public, but experts fear it will lead to less oversight of commercial sales of assault weapons like submachine guns and flame throwers to foreign buyers. ADVERTISEMENT Less oversight, they warn, could make it easier for deadly weapons to end up in the hands of terrorists and drug cartels. “It’s a major change,” said Colby Goodman, director of the Security Assistance Monitor program at the Center for International Policy. “It’s opening up a lot more risk and a lot more opportunity for illegal and illicit trafficking.” The State Department said it is shifting responsibility to Commerce for approving exports of nonmilitary firearms and ammunition that are already commercially available — those under Categories I, II and III on the U.S. Munitions List. The goal is to reduce regulatory burdens on manufacturers and exporters. Under the proposed rules, an administration official told The Hill, firearms and related articles that are uniquely military or that are not otherwise widely available for commercial sale would remain under State Department export licensing controls. In shifting oversight, exporters and manufacturers, including small gunsmiths, would no longer have to register with the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and pay the $2,250 annual registration fee. But experts say if exporters aren’t forced to register with the federal government, there will be no way to track and no one to prosecute when weapons end up in the wrong hands. “There are plenty of cases when in regular processes weapons have been lost,” said Jeff Abramson, a nonresident senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, adding that these are the weapons often used in human rights abuses. Democrats are particularly upset with one potential change in the proposal. Shifting oversight from the State Department to the Commerce Department, they say, would eliminate congressional review that’s now required under the Arms Export Control Act for any commercial sales of lethal weapons worth $1 million or more. “As you are aware, combat firearms and ammunition are uniquely lethal; they are easily spread and easily modified, and are the primary means of injury, death and destruction in civil and military conflicts throughout the world,” Sens.

In an interview with The Hill, Torres said the Commerce Department has a very different role than the State Department, which leads on foreign affairs. “[Commerce’s] interest is selling U.S.-made goods,” she said. “They aren’t looking at things from a public safety point of view.” Torres said the types of weapons being sold could cause a lot of problems in countries where democracy is fragile. “The State Department has more knowledge about what’s happening on the ground,” she said. The administration, however, disagrees. “The Commerce Department is uniquely qualified to handle these rule changes,” the administration official said in an email to The Hill. “In fact, the Department of Commerce has decades of experience in licensing firearms for export under the Export Administration Regulations. This involves the export, re-export, and transfer (in-country) of 12-gauge shotguns, optical sighting devices for firearms, and crime control equipment.” The official said each export license would go through a rigorous interagency review process that includes the Defense and State departments to ensure national security and human rights concerns are addressed. “The proposed changes will allow the Commerce Department to use its expertise and resources through its in-agency law enforcement unit, and its robust end use verification program,” the official said. “This transfer will not create opportunities to put weapons in the hands of bad actors.” Gun manufacturers and former Obama administration officials say the hysteria over the rule is overblown and premature. The rule, after all, has been in the works since 2012 and is expected to mimic an Obama-era proposal that was slated for release, but stalled after 20 children and six adults were killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Kevin Wolf, the former assistant secretary of Commerce for export administration, said gun rights and gun control groups should relax until they’ve seen the actual wording of the rule. “Everybody just chill,” he said. “Anyone who has any concerns should just relax until they see an actual rule to comment on.” Larry Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said he’s been told the current rule isn’t significantly or materially different than the Obama-era proposal. “It is disingenuous for people like Sen. Cardin and other Democrats to now complain about the policy when the rules were over at [the Office of Management and Budget] and within hours of being published” under Obama, he said. A former administration official familiar with the rule discussions said export licenses still would have been required for assault weapons under the Obama-era rule. Licensing requirements would have been eased, however, for the less sensitive gun parts like screws and springs. “The assumption is the Commerce Department is less restrictive, but the difference is less sensitive items can be treated less sensitively, but more lethal items can be treated more aggressively,” the former official said. The push to change the rules is supported by the National Rifle Association, which says many people who never intend to export a firearm or firearm accessories, like gunsmiths and parts manufacturers, are now required to register with the State Department and pay high fees to operate their business. “The NRA supports the Trump administration’s efforts to complete the reforms and transfer law-abiding firearms and ammunition manufacturers from an export system designed for nuclear submarines and ballistic missiles into one designed around lawful commercial products,” said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker. The State Department’s proposed rule was sent to OIRA on Sept. 26 and is marked as pending review. The office has 90 days to review the rule, but that deadline can be extended indefinitely by the head of the rulemaking agency. The Office of Management and Budget, which oversees OIRA, said it has a longstanding policy of not commenting on rules under review.",Firearm Assault rifle Gun Gun violence Machine gun Rifle Airsoft Guns Trigger National Rifle Association DAX MONTHLY HEDGED TR JPY,A gun used by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.,"The Trump administration’s expected plan to transfer the licensing of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department has Democratic lawmakers and foreign policy advocates readying for a fight.

979,979,85,https://www.vox.com/2018/8/27/17785896/jacksonville-landing-mass-shooting-gun-violence,America can prevent shootings like Jacksonville. But it must come to terms with its gun problem.,"It was just another video game tournament. Based on the live stream, players were playing Madden NFL 19, and shoutcasters were giving the typical play-by-play, while the chat on Twitch.tv carried on with conversation about the match and memes. But then, a laser point appeared on one of the player’s chests. Suddenly, 12 shots rang out. There was chaos on the live stream — screaming and running around as the game abruptly paused. A voice could be heard asking, “Oh, fuck, what’d he shoot me with?” At that moment, this tournament in Jacksonville Landing in Florida, had become the site of another mass shooting in America. By the end of the gunfire, three people, including the shooter, were killed, and at least 11 were injured. It was a horrifying end to a tournament that was supposed to be a qualifying event for a national competition sponsored by EA Sports later this year. By now, mass shootings have become almost routine in America. One seems to make the news every month or so. Since the mass shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, more than 1,800 mass shootings — defined as any shooting in which four or more people, excluding the shooter, were shot although not necessarily killed — have happened in the US. We don’t yet know why this particular shooter carried out a horrific act of gun violence. But we do know why this keeps happening in America. Guns. America has the laxest gun laws of any wealthy country in the world, and it also has by far the highest number of privately owned firearms. The easy access to guns makes it easy for anyone to escalate just about any encounter into deadly violence. This means not just more mass shootings, but gun violence in general, which the US has a lot more of than its developed peers. The US can do something about this. But to understand that, it’s crucial to grasp five key points about America’s gun problem, from how unique it is to why it might take more far-reaching solutions than anyone is proposing in mainstream politics. 1) America has a unique gun violence problem The US is unique in two key — and related — ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2016. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, “The US makes up less than 5% of the world’s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.” The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms. These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. Researchers have found this to be true not just with homicides, but also with suicides (which in recent years were around 60 percent of US gun deaths), domestic violence, and even violence against police. For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate. This chart, based on data from GunPolicy.org, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) among wealthier nations: Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. 2) The problem is guns, not mental illness Supporters of gun rights look at America’s high levels of gun violence and argue that guns are not the problem. They point to other issues, from violence in video games and movies to the supposed breakdown of the traditional family. Most recently, they’ve blamed mental health issues for mass shootings. But as far as homicides go, people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, had mental illnesses. “The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘chief’ perpetrators of mass murder,” he concluded. Other research has backed this up. More broadly, America does not have a monopoly on mental illness. That’s not to say more access to mental health care wouldn’t help; it could, for example, be effective for reducing the number of gun suicides. But mental health issues aren’t what make the US stand out in terms of gun violence. The problem that’s unique to the US, instead, is guns — and America’s abundance of them. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime: Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. ”A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone. 3) The research shows that gun control works The research also suggests that gun control can work. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives. Consider Australia’s example. In 1996, a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur, Australia, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia’s history. Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory buyback program, in which it purchased firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.) Australia’s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to a review of the evidence by Harvard researchers. It’s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes. Australia’s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: “First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.” One study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant because Australia already had a pretty low number of murders. But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking. One other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: “While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.” 4) State and local actions are not enough A common counterpoint to the evidence on gun control: If it works so well, why does Chicago have so much gun violence despite having some of the strictest gun policies in the US? White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made this argument after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting: “I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there.” It’s true that Chicago has fairly strict gun laws (although not the strictest). And it’s true that the city has fairly high levels of gun violence (although also not the worst in the US). This doesn’t, however, expose the failure of gun control altogether, but rather the limits of leaving gun policies to a patchwork of local and state laws. The basic problem: If a city or state passes strict gun control measures, people can simply cross a border to buy guns in a jurisdiction with laxer laws. Chicago, for example, requires a Firearm Owners Identification card, a background check, a three-day waiting period, and documentation for all firearm sales. But Indiana, across the border, doesn’t require any of this for purchases between two private individuals (including those at gun shows and those who meet through the internet), allowing even someone with a criminal record to buy a firearm without passing a background check or submitting paperwork recording the sale. So someone from Chicago can drive across the border — to Indiana or to other places with lax gun laws — and buy a gun without any of the big legal hurdles he would face at home. Then that person can resell or give guns to others in Chicago, or keep them, leaving no paper trail behind. (This is illegal trafficking under federal law, but Indiana’s lax laws and enforcement — particularly the lack of a paper trail — make it virtually impossible to catch someone until a gun is used in a crime.) The result: According to a 2014 report from the Chicago Police Department, nearly 60 percent of the guns in crime scenes that were recovered and traced between 2009 and 2013 came from outside the state. About 19 percent came from Indiana — making it the most common state of origin for guns besides Illinois. This isn’t exclusive to Chicago. A 2016 report from the New York State Office of the Attorney General found that 74 percent of guns used in crimes in New York between 2010 and 2015 came from states with lax gun laws. (The gun trafficking chain from Southern states with weak gun laws to New York is so well-known it even has a name: “the Iron Pipeline.”) And another 2016 report from the US Government Accountability Office found that most of the guns — as many as 70 percent — used in crimes in Mexico, which has strict gun laws, can be traced back to the US, which has generally weaker gun laws. That doesn’t mean the stricter gun laws in Chicago, New York, or any other jurisdiction have no effect, but it does limit how far these local and state measures can go, since the root of the problem lies in other places’ laws. The only way the pipeline could be stopped would be if all states individually strengthened their gun laws at once — or, more realistically, if the federal government passed a law that enforces stricter rules across the US. 5) America probably needs to go further than anyone wants to admit America’s attention to gun control often focuses on a few specific measures: universal background checks, restrictions on people with mental illnesses buying firearms, and an assault weapons ban, for example. It is rare that American politicians, even on the left, go much further than that. Something like Australia’s law — which amounts to a confiscation program — is never seriously considered. As Matthews previously explained, this is a big issue. The US’s gun problem is so dire that it arguably needs solutions that go way further than what we typically see in mainstream proposals — at least, if the US ever hopes to get down to European levels of gun violence. If the fundamental problem is that America has far too many guns, then policies need to cut the number of guns in circulation right now to seriously reduce the number of gun deaths. Background checks and other restrictions on who can buy a gun can’t achieve that in the short term. What America likely needs, then, is something more like Australia’s mandatory buyback program — essentially, a gun confiscation scheme — paired with a serious ban on specific firearms (including, potentially, all semiautomatic weapons). But no one in Congress is seriously proposing something that sweeping. The Manchin-Toomey bill, the only gun legislation in Congress after Sandy Hook that came close to becoming law, didn’t even establish universal background checks. Recent proposals have been even milder, taking small steps like banning bump stocks or very slightly improving the existing system for background checks. Part of the holdup is the Second Amendment. While there is reasonable scholarly debate about whether the Second Amendment actually protects all Americans’ individual right to bear arms and prohibits stricter forms of gun control, the reality is the Supreme Court and US lawmakers — backed by the powerful gun lobby, particularly the NRA — widely agree that the Second Amendment does put barriers on how far restrictions can go. That would likely rule out anything like the Australian policy response short of a court reinterpretation or a repeal of the Second Amendment, neither of which seems likely. So the US, for political, cultural, and legal reasons, seems to be unable to take the action that it really needs. None of that is to say that milder measures are useless. Connecticut’s law requiring handgun purchasers to first pass a background check and obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in handgun suicides. Similar results — in the reverse — were reported in Missouri when it repealed its own permit-to-purchase law. It’s difficult to separate these changes from long-term trends (especially since gun homicides have generally been on the decline for decades now), but a review of the evidence by RAND linked milder gun control measures, including background checks, to reduced injuries and deaths — and that means these measures likely save lives. There are also some evidence-based policies that could help outside the realm of gun control, including more stringent regulations and taxes on alcohol, changes in policing, and behavioral intervention programs. But if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much, much further on guns in particular.",Jacksonville Landing Jacksonville Landing shooting Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Video Games Mass shooting Madden NFL Shooting Car Police car Police,"A shooting victim in Jacksonville, Fla., on Monday.","It was just another video game tournament.

When police searched Jarrell’s home, they found an internet search history on “How to conduct a school shooting” and a “credible and imminent threat to Shelby and Anderson County schools,” according to a press release. Police also revealed that in May, Jarrell had been questioned by the FBI regarding social media threats toward a Tennessee school.

Conway appeared on Fox & Friends, blaming “anti-religiosity” for Saturday’s attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue, which killed 11 people. The senior White House counselor to President Trump also called out “late-night comedians” for perpetuating such sentiment. “The anti-religiosity in this country, that is somehow in vogue and funny to make fun of anybody of faith, to constantly be making fun of people who express religion, the late-night comedians, the unfunny people on TV shows, it’s always anti-religious,” Conway said on the Fox News morning show. She continued, “And, remember, these people were gunned down in their place of worship, as were the people in South Carolina several years ago.” Conway was referencing the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., carried out by white supremacist Dylann Roof. He was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering nine people in the 2015 incident. “And they were there because they’re people of faith, and it’s faith that needs to bring us together,” stated Conway. “This is no time to be driving God out of the public square. No time to be making fun of people.” The Pittsburgh shooting marked the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Federal prosecutors have filed hate-crime charges against Robert Bowers, a 46-year-old white man who surrendered to authorities after Saturday morning’s shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. Law enforcement officials told CNN that he had made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting and targeted Jews on social media. Although Conway failed to discuss the growing issue of anti-Semitism in the United States, she praised President Trump for using such a phrase.

""As you review the contents of this reply, we believe it is important to tell you that we respect the national debate that is currently underway regarding firearms and safety,"" the letter from American Outdoo (AOBC)r said. ""The solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company, our employees, our industry, our shareholders, the economies we support and, significantly, the rights of our law abiding customers, but results in no increase in public safety,"" said the company. The company made the Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle used to kill 17 people in the mass shooting in Parkland, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Department. ""We share the nation's grief over the incomprehensible and senseless loss of life in Parkland, Florida, and we share the desire to make our communities safer,"" said the letter. The company said it wanted to ""address the challenges of acute mental illness in our society"" and improve the federal background check system, a move that has also been floated by the National Rifle Association and other groups that oppose tightened gun control. Related: BlackRock has questions for gun makers BlackRock, which manages trillions of dollars for other investors, is the leading shareholder for American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger (RGR). It is the second-biggest shareholder of Vista Outdoor (VSTO). All three of those companies make guns, including AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. BlackRock said it will start offering clients the option to invest in funds that exclude firearm manufacturers and retailers. It also said it will more actively engage with gun manufacturers, and in some instances vote against the wishes of company management. In response to American Outdoor, BlackRock said: ""Responsible business policies and practices are critical to firearms manufacturers' long-term prospects."" ""We will continue to engage with these companies to further understand their business policies and practices in order to protect our clients' investments in them,"" BlackRock said. Related: Gun sales plunge for Smith & Wesson owner In the weeks after the Parkland shooting, gun control advocates encouraged companies to reevaluate their relationship with gun makers and the National Rifle Association, the country's most powerful gun lobby. Companies including Delta Air Line (DAL)and Enterprise Holdings, which owns Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Alamo Rent a Car and National Car Rental, ended discounts for NRA members. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), a gun retailer, said it would stop selling AR-15-style rifles, and wouldn't sell any guns to anyone under 21. Walmart (WMT)stopped selling them in 2015, and also raised its minimum purchase age last week, as did the grocery chain Kroger (KR), which sells guns through its Fred Meyer stores.

Charles Martin Ellis, 64, was charged Wednesday in a Nevada federal court with one count of engaging in firearms dealing without a license and one count of transfer or sale of a firearm to a nonresident, according to the indictment. Prosecutors say Ellis sold the Zastava 7.62-millimeter caliber pistol that was used in a dramatic shootout on Aug. 30, 2017, that ended with two California Highway Patrol officers wounded and Deputy Robert French, a 21-year veteran of the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, dead. According to the Sheriff’s Department, investigators also found two handguns and a live hand grenade in the shooter’s vehicle after he was caught. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced the gun back to a man who purchased it from Ellis in Nevada, prosecutors said. Advertisement “The genesis of this investigation started the day Bob French was murdered,” Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones said in a statement. “With the gracious help of our federal partners and their relentless pursuit of this investigation, a dangerous felon that provided the instrument that killed Deputy French will now be held to answer. It does little to fill the hole that still exists in his family and in our Department family, but it helps provide both a small measure toward justice and helps reduce the risk of a similar recurrence elsewhere.” Between January 2016 and February 2018, Ellis bought and quickly sold 250 firearms, including AR-15 and AK-47 assault-style weapons, without a federal firearms license, the indictment says. He allegedly sold the guns to residents of Nevada, Texas, Arizona and California. Several of the guns were used in crimes in Nevada and California, prosecutors said. Ellis faces up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted.

Protests at NRA’s first annual meeting since Parkland Gun control activists are to meet 80,000 National Rifle Association supporters in Dallas this weekend, where the gun lobby is hosting its annual three-day meeting. The convention is being held less than two months after the push for gun control drew thousands to protests across the country and inspired one of the largest student demonstrations in US history. An additional stressor for the NRA is the impact these actions and Donald Trump’s divisiveness will have on the Republican party heading into the November midterms. The Guardian’s Lois Beckett has done a great breakdown of the six threats facing the NRA here and will be reporting from the convention all weekend. Trump, whose campaign accepted more than $30m from the NRA in 2016, spoke Friday afternoon at the first day of the convention. “Thanks to your activism and dedication. You have an administration fighting to protect your second amendment and we will protect your second amendment,” he said. And if you’re wondering why the NRA is so powerful, the Guardian US business editor, Dominic Rushe, has the answer here. Teacher backs immigrants and refugees in moment with Trump At the White House this week, the National Teacher of the Year staged a silent protest by wearing overtly political badges, including one with a poster for the Women’s March, when she accepted her award from Trump. Mandy Manning, who leads a classroom for teenage refugees in Washington, also wore badges that supported the LGBT community to the annual ceremony. Manning told the Associated Press that in a private moment with Trump she gave the president letters written by her students and the community that she hoped would convey what coming to the US means for refugees and immigrants. Story continues Immigration lawyers have warned repeatedly that White House policies are slowing immigration to the US. And refugee groups have been sounding an alarm about the the fall in refugee admissions this fiscal year. Only 10,584 people have been admitted in the past six months, compared with 39,000 refugee admissions in the same period in 2017, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The annual ceremony took place against the backdrop of teachers’ strikes in Arizona, Colorado, Kentucky, Oklahoma and West Virginia amid complaints over stagnant pay and shrinking pensions.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo By Alana Wise NEW YORK (Reuters) - Georgia state legislators on Thursday struck down what would have been a lucrative tax exemption for hometown carrier Delta Air Lines , after vowing to punish the airline for ending its relationship with the National Rifle Association. Led by a Republican majority, state lawmakers passed a tax bill that excludes a jet fuel tax exemption designed to benefit Delta, the state's largest private employer. It was the most significant blowback yet after the carrier said last week it was cutting ties with the NRA following a Florida school massacre. Delta said it was ending a discount program for NRA members and had asked the gun rights group to remove its information from the group's website after the Feb. 14 slaying of 17 students and educators at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Fort Lauderdale suburb of Parkland. The killings reignited the long-running U.S. debate over gun ownership laws Delta did not respond to a request on Thursday for comment about the Georgia tax bill. In a statement on Saturday, the carrier said it supports the Second Amendment, which grants Americans the right to bear arms, and that it wished to stay neutral in the emotionally charged debate. Georgia Republicans had criticized the airline's move to cut its ties to the NRA. They were led by Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle, president of the state senate, who vowed to kill any tax legislation that benefited Delta. The bill that passed the Georgia House of Representatives and Senate on Thursday had previously included tax exemption language that had been projected to save Delta some $40 million a year in jet fuel tax. Georgia Governor Nathan Deal had on Wednesday criticized the decision to exclude the exemption as ""the type of antics that tend to plague election years,"" but said he would still sign the bill after it passed. Cagle is running to succeed Deal in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial race. Deal said he remained committed to eliminating Georgia's sales tax on jet fuel, ""which is non-negotiable.""

The shooting occurred during the first event of the Madden eSports season. The shooting could prompt a re-evaluation of security measures at the growing number of esports tournaments. The gaming community reacted in shock and sadness on Sunday, after a mass shooting at a Florida esports event left three people dead. The shooting turned what had been a good-natured season-opening event for a league of passionate Madden football players into the latest scene of carnage resulting from a mass shooting in the US.

The event featured several professional players as well as dozens of aspiring esports players. While esports has grown into a more than $500 million industry according to Goldman Sachs, the leagues based on real-world sports like football and basketball are generally considered smaller than the leagues for fantasy and first-person-shooter games such as Call of Duty and Dota 2. But news of the tragedy quickly spread across the broader industry of video gamers and esports contestants. During a League of Legends tournament on Sunday, the video stream included a live statement to pay respects to the victims of the shooting in Florida.

According to the LA Times, the shooter was a participant in the Madden tournament who had been eliminated earlier in the day, but authorities did not provide a motive or confirm whether Katz was involved in the tournament. EA did not return requests for comment, though it tweeted statements earlier that it was working with the authorities to gather facts about the ""horrible"" situation.

With Florida voters scheduled to pick candidates for governor and Congress on Tuesday, some Democratic contenders said the shooting was further evidence of the need for stricter gun legislation while other hopefuls canceled campaign appearances. ""We as society have to come together and say enough of this,"" Democratic U.S. Senator Bill Nelson told reporters in Jacksonville, near the site of the shooting at a Madden 19 online football game tournament. The violence, which also injured 11 people, was the latest in a series of high-profile shootings in the state, following the killing of 17 students and educators at a high school in February and the massacre of 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in 2016. The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office identified the shooter, who took his own life, as David Katz, 24, of Baltimore. Witnesses told local media Katz was angry because he lost the tournament. Katz was hospitalized twice as a teenager for mental illness and prescribed anti-psychotic and anti-depressant medications, the Baltimore Sun reported, citing his parents' divorce filings. Reuters could not independently confirm the report. Nelson's re-election campaign is facing a November challenge by the state's Republican governor, Rick Scott, in one of the key races that will determine the balance of power in the Senate. Gun rights, which are covered by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, are one of the most contentious themes of American politics. The debate breaks along party lines, with Republicans typically arguing that better enforcement of existing gun laws is the best way to deter shootings, while Democrats call for more restrictions on weapons ownership. Given the partisan breakdown, the shooting may not change outcomes in Tuesday's primaries where people will pick candidates from within their own parties. Story continues 'SHAME ON YOU' State Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, one of the Republicans seeking to succeed Scott as governor, canceled a campaign event in Jacksonville and on Twitter said his ""prayers continue to be with the victims and their families."" Democratic front-runner Gwen Graham called on Putnam and his leading Republican rival, U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis, to offer a stronger policy response. ""@AdamPutnam and @RonDeSantisFL are avoiding Jacksonville because they are scared to answer questions on gun violence,"" Graham said in a Monday Twitter post. DeSantis spokesman Stephen Lawson said it was not the time to talk policy. ""We chose not to politicize a tragedy,"" Lawson said. ""This is a sad attempt to score a quick political point while families are still grieving. Shame on you."" One of the people slain was Elijah Clayton, 22, of Woodland Hills, California, a representative of his family told reporters on Monday. The other was Taylor Robertson, 27, of Ballard, West Virginia, local media reported, citing family members. Robertson, a husband and father, won the tournament last year and Katz won it the year before, according to Madden publisher EA Sports, the unit of Electronic Arts Inc, which sponsored Sunday's tournament. Katz had two handguns and extra ammunition but appeared to have fired only one gun, Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said at a news conference. Katz bought the guns, at least one of which was equipped with a laser sight, legally in Maryland, Williams said. Williams said the shooter targeted other gamers. ""The suspect walked past patrons who were in other parts of the business and focused his attention on the gamers,"" he said.

Why wasn't he stopped?,"The police knew about his threats. The newspaper he assailed considered him a danger. And in tweets available for anyone to see, the man suspected of killing five at a Maryland newspaper this week broadcast his hate with a stream of invective. The failure to stop Jarrod Ramos, charged with five counts of first-degree murder for Thursday’s deadly rampage at the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, shows the blind spots that foil law enforcement and internet companies — even as the social media gusher puts the warning signs in plain sight. “The terror and violence that we saw at Capital Gazette is another horrible example why our laws need to be updated to reflect modern-day crime,” said Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., who has been pushing for years to bolster federal online harassment laws and increase cybertraining for police departments around the country. Ramos, 38, posted harassing social media messages that alarmed editors at the newspaper and led police to investigate but fell short of leading authorities to pursue charges or Twitter to ban him. Twitter suspended Ramos’ account Friday. It declined to comment on it. Ramos’ grudge with the Capital Gazette dated back to a July 2011 article in which the paper chronicled his guilty plea for harassing a former high school classmate by email, phone and on Facebook. A year later Ramos filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper in a Maryland state court and later added a charge of invasion of privacy over the newspaper’s coverage of his conviction. The lawsuit eventually was dismissed, but that did not stop Ramos from launching a Twitter campaign in which he unleashed vitriol against the paper and its staff, including threats against the former staff reporter who wrote about his harassment conviction, Eric Thomas Hartley, and the retired publisher, Tom Marquardt. In one haunting tweet in February 2015, Ramos’ account said, “I'll enjoy seeing @capgaznews cease publication, but it would be nicer to see Hartley and Marquardt cease breathing.” Ramos' Twitter account featured journalist Hartley's picture as its avatar and included the tagline ""making corpses of corrupt careers."" On Hartley's forehead was an image inserted from the Japanese manga and anime series ""Berserk,"" which recounts the ritual murder of people marked with it. Ramos also placed the symbol on Marquardt's head. Since Nov. 20, 2011, Ramos mentioned in tweets @ethartley or his last name 107 times, Marquardt by name or as ""Evil Tom"" nearly 100 times and @capgaznews more than 50 times, according to a USA TODAY analysis. The account regularly attacked the newspaper and its journalists, including a reference to the deadly shooting at the French newspaper Charlie Hebdo in 2015. It had been dormant since January 2016. Shortly before the shooting on Thursday, it posted a message: “F--- you, leave me alone.” That was the same message it posted the day after the state’s second-highest court upheld a ruling in favor of the newspaper.

More:'Most dangerous person I've ever dealt with': Lawyer feared newspaper murder suspect More:Jarrod Ramos, suspect in Capital Gazette shooting, planned attack and blocked escape route Marquardt told the Capital Gazette that he called Anne Arundel County police years ago to express his concerns about Ramos' attacks on the newspaper and its journalists on social media. ""I was seriously concerned he would threaten us with physical violence,"" Marquardt said. ""I even told my wife: 'We have to be concerned. This guy could really hurt us.'"" Anne Arundel County Police Chief Timothy Altomare said that a detective was assigned to investigate the matter in May 2013 but that the newspaper ultimately declined to pursue criminal charges. ""There was a fear that doing so would exacerbate an already flammable situation,"" Altomare said. Some law enforcement experts questioned whether Ramos’ online posts crossed a legal threshold that would have allowed police to file charges. “His statements may be defamatory, they may be libelous, they may be obnoxious. … But the question is: Are his statements credible threats? In retrospect, it’s easy to say yes. But we have a lot of crazy people in this world saying things,"" said Peter Scharf, co-founder of the Gulf Coast Computer Forensics Laboratory and a criminologist at Louisiana State University. “You now have people saying, ‘Police should be patrolling the internet,’” Scharf said. “But really what’s here that would trigger a rational law enforcement intervention?” Twitter's scourge Online harassment has become an epic problem. Four in 10 Americans have personally experienced online harassment, and 18 percent of Americans said they have been subjected to particularly severe forms of harassment online, such as physical threats, harassment over a sustained period, sexual harassment or stalking, a 2017 Pew Research Center survey shows. The harassment happens on Facebook, Instagram or anywhere users can comment publicly on another's update. But Twitter, Ramos' apparent platform of choice, has long been dogged by rampant abuse problems. For years Twitter was reluctant to limit freedom of expression on the service. People don’t have to use their real names on Twitter. And with that anonymity has come racist, sexist and anti-Semitic taunts and attacks, as well as full-fledged campaigns from trolls, individuals or groups whose primary intent is to sow discord on social media platforms. Ineffective efforts to police that behavior have driven some users, including prominent ones, from the platform. Twitter now concedes it did not move quickly enough to curb abuse and harassment. Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has pledged Twitter would work to make sure it becomes a healthier environment for users – at the same time abuse on Twitter intensified during and after the presidential election. The company has taken more forceful steps to curbing harassment, such as reducing the visibility of accounts that are disruptive or abusive, giving users new tools to block content they don't want to see, and beefing up training of employees who review harassment complaints from Twitter users. It's unclear whether the tweets on the Ramos account violated Twitter's rules. According to its terms of service, Twitter bans ""abusive behavior and hateful conduct,"" and it bans specific threats of violence of physical harm, death or disease. The threats have to be ""explicit statements of one's intent to kill or inflict serious physical harm against another person."" More:Twitter vows new crackdown on abuse after Harvey Weinstein boycott New tools to identify harmful behavior would not not have alerted Twitter to Ramos, whose account had been dormant for more than two years until Thursday, when he made a final menacing tweet. Before Twitter began using the new tools, an individual user would have had to flag Ramos' tweets as a problem. Even when users flag such abuse, Twitter has had a patchy track record of acting on the complaint. Facebook and Twitter are still not dedicating enough resources to content moderation and are not imposing stiff enough penalties on those who break the rules, fueling the behavior of online trolls, said Jennifer Grygiel, a Syracuse University communications professor who studies social media. ""What we are seeing, too, is that online trolls know exactly the limits in content moderation, how far they can push things before content gets flagged,"" she said. ""Often aggressive comments fall short of content moderation language."" Police often lack tools, know-how Clark, the Massachusetts congresswoman, said the scourge of online harassment is further complicated by the fact that many law enforcement agencies – particularly small and midsized ones – have little capacity to train officers on how to investigate incidents. She has proposed legislation in the House that includes a $20-million-a-year grant to assist state and local law enforcement in cybercrimes training and a $4-million-a-year grant to establish a National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals that would provide departments technical assistance. On the federal level, prosecution of cybercrimes has been inconsistent, analysts say. Clark said cybercrime has simply been a lower priority for federal prosecutors. ""With the training of law enforcement, we have seen some progress. Indeed, there are prosecutors who specialize in online abuse,” said Danielle Citron, University of Maryland law professor who advises Twitter on safety. “But the gains have been modest, and online stalking laws remain seriously underenforced around the country."" Brianna Wu, a computer programmer who faced death and rape threats from supporters of a militant online movement known as Gamergate that targeted feminist criticism of the gaming scene, said the Capital Gazette massacre underscored that all stakeholders – law enforcement, lawmakers, social media platforms and their users – need to act. The FBI identified four men who sent threats of rape and murder to women, including Wu. The U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, however, declined to prosecute. “Everyone has a role to play – myself included,” said Wu, who is now running for Congress in Massachusetts. “We need to stop feeling powerless, and we need to start getting it done.” More:Capital Gazette gunman was identified using facial recognition technology that's been controversial Contributing: Bart Jansen",Rob Hiaasen Steve Schuh Capital Gazette shooting Annapolis The Capital Newspaper Journalist Shooting Murder Mass shooting,"A memorial for the victims of the shooting at the Capital Parade newspaper in Annapolis, Md., on Thursday.","The police knew about his threats.

1132,1132,10136,http://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-weighs-video-game-gun-violence-210950846.html,White House weighs video game link to gun violence,"Some critics believe violent video games might be influencing the behavior of young people (AFP Photo/THOMAS SAMSON) San Francisco (AFP) - Video game industry representatives will trek to Washington Thursday to persuade lawmakers that virtual violence does not trigger real-world lashing out, amid a reignited gun debate in the wake of the latest horrific school shooting. The meeting between US President Donald Trump and the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) trade group comes less than a month after a teenaged gunman bearing a semi-automatic weapon shot dead 17 people at his former Florida high school. In the aftermath of the attack Trump pointed to video games as a possible contributing factor to the firearms violence plaguing the nation. ""We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed,"" the Republican leader said. ""And also video games. I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts."" But the ESA says gaming is ""plainly"" not at fault, wielding data showing no established link between games and violence in the flesh. ""Like all Americans, we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States,"" the ESA said in response to an AFP inquiry about the upcoming White House meeting. ""Video games are plainly not the issue: entertainment is distributed and consumed globally, but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation."" Video games are calculated to be a $100 billion a year global business by market intelligence firm NewZoo. - White House rematch - Thursday's meeting comes five years after Joe Biden, then vice president, met with the ESA, heads of major video game companies, and researchers as the nation grappled with Connecticut's Sandy Hook massacre that saw 20 primary school-age children gunned down. Following that shooting the National Rifle Association singled out video games as the true danger to society. ""There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows violence against its own people,"" said the NRA's Wayne LaPierre, blaming ""vicious violent video games"" as well as ""bloodsoaked films."" But gaming industry veteran Mark DeLoura -- who attended the Biden meeting and later spent two years as a White House senior adviser for digital media -- said that ""if anything, it seems like it has gotten clearer there is no correlation."" ""All of our research related to games is there, Trump would just have to ask for it,"" he said. ""That makes me mad; one administration should learn from another."" Both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have taken a stance in recent years against children and teens playing violent video games. But a rising number of academics question the evidence of a link between gaming and aggression, and more than 200 scholars joined to speak out against an APA report affirming such a connection. - 'Gut-feelings' vs 'facts' - It is not the first time video games have come under scrutiny: a high-profile 1993 congressional hearing spearheaded by Democratic senators targeted games including ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Night Trap"" for violent play, with some lawmakers saying the games encouraged or desensitized minors to brutality and bloodshed. A later effort by California officials to ban sales of violent video games to children was struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2011 on the grounds that, like books and films, games are protected by constitutional rights to free speech. DeLoura said blaming video games that feature brutal play might stem from the ""gut-feelings"" of adults watching children engage in virtual battles, rather than hard data. ""What's causing shootings is guns are so accessible that when you have an impulse, you can act on it,"" he said. ""Does it have to be more complicated than that?"" With a gun culture that runs deep, America is deadlocked over how to stem the scourge of mass shootings. But video games, the industry holds, are innocent. ""Blaming video games for violence in the real world is no more productive than blaming the news media for bringing violent crimes into our homes night after night,"" the ESA says on its website. Video game play is booming as spectator sport, with fans flocking to arenas for tournaments as well as watching matches online. The association notably cites data trends showing that violent crime, particularly by young people, has declined in the US since the early 1990s -- even as video games have flourished. ""The rise of this conversation again isn't about facts, it isn't about research,"" said DeLoura in a recent blog post. ""It's about politics.""",Video game addiction Video Games World Health Organization  Mental disorder  Game Health Disease Mental health,A video game video game.,"Some critics believe violent video games might be influencing the behavior of young people (AFP Photo/THOMAS SAMSON) San Francisco (AFP) - Video game industry representatives will trek to Washington Thursday to persuade lawmakers that virtual violence does not trigger real-world lashing out, amid a reignited gun debate in the wake of the latest horrific school shooting.",""" we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the u.s., "" says joe biden.

""That's where it gets really strange to me,"" Loesch says on Friday's episode. ""Am I to understand this entire time that Thomas and his trains were white? Because they all have gray faces.

Police interrogated Cruz hours after the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead and 17 wounded, and fueled the national debate about gun control. Cruz told Broward County Sheriff’s Office detective John Curcio during his 12-hour interrogation that a “demon” voice in his head told him to “Burn. Kill. Destroy.” The voice, he claimed, directed him to buy the AR-15 used in the massacre and to take an Uber to the school. He also told Curcio that, before the Parkland shooting, he had planned to open fire on people at a park and had experienced a previous run-in with police for “shooting animals.” He told police he had made two past attempts on his own life, one with Ibuprofen and one with alcohol.* Several pages of the transcript have been redacted. At varying points during the interview, Cruz talked to himself, contradicted his own statements, and requested a psychologist. He became defensive when Curcio expressed doubt about the “voice” in his head. “Personally, I think you’re using the demon as an excuse,” the police detective said. “You could have stopped the demon any time you want. You didn’t want to stop the demon … I think you like the demon.” After disputing that claim, Cruz asked for an attorney. When Curcio left the room for a moment, Cruz said, “I want to die.” Cruz’s brother Zachary was brought into the room later in the interview, saying, “People think you’re a monster now. … Why did you do this?” “I’m sorry, dude,” Cruz replied. Much of that conversation has been redacted. On the day of the shooting, Cruz was arrested in a neighborhood near the school. The Washington Post reported that Cruz had escaped the campus virtually unnoticed during the chaos that ensued. A court-ordered report, which was released on Friday and published unredacted by the Sun-Sentinel, revealed that Cruz had asked the Broward County school district for special counseling assistance months before the shooting, but the district did not follow through. Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of murder in the first degree and 17 counts of attempted murder. His defense attorneys are looking to strike a plea deal, in which Cruz would plead guilty in exchange for life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. “He is the most damaged and broken human being I have encountered in 40 years doing this type of work,” Broward County public defender Howard Finkelstein told the Washington Post in an email. The transcript adds to a litany of evidence previously released by law enforcement, as The Washington Post points out, including footage of police responding to the crime scene, some 911 calls from the attack, and video footage of Cruz announcing his plans to become “a professional school shooter” and bragging about how it would make him famous. The release of the transcript and a video of the interrogation was ordered by a Florida judge last month. It comes just a week before the start of the new school year at Stoneman Douglas.",Nikolas Cruz Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School School shooting Columbine High School massacre Fort Lauderdale Suspect Shooting Lawyer Massacre,"A police photo of the suspect in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., in February.","A police interrogation transcript released on Monday contains not only Nikolas Cruz’s confession to carrying out the shooting at a Parkland, Florida, high school but also remarks that reveal his state of mind before, during, and after the attack.

That’s the theory at Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Michigan, where faculty members are being trained to fight school shooters using, among other things, hockey pucks. OU Police Chief Mark Gordon told local station WDIV-TV, the pucks are being given to teachers and students to throw at school shooters and cause a distraction. Gordon knows something of which he speaks. As a former youth hockey coach, he told the Detroit News he was once hit in the head with a puck. It “caused a fair amount of damage to me,” he said. Hockey pucks are perfect for defense, he said, though he acknowledged he knows of no research on using pucks in active shooter situations. They’re heavy enough to cause damage and compact enough to be carried in backpacks, but aren’t considered weapons by law enforcement. “Anything that you can throw that’s heavy and will cause damage, cause injury is the bottom line of what you’re trying to do,” Gordon said, according to the Detroit Free Press. A hockey puck “was just a thing that was suggested that could possibly work, especially when you have 20 or 30 people in a classroom and they all throw hockey pucks at the same time ― it would be quite the distraction.” Faculty member Garry J. Gilbert admitted he was skeptical about the puck plan. “My first reaction was: You are talking about facing an assault weapon and asking us to fight back with hockey pucks? It sounded silly,” Gilbert told the Detroit News. “Then I went through the training session, and it all made sense. None of us want to face an armed assailant. Students will look to us for leadership in a situation like that.” The training encourages the faculty to flee if possible, and hide if not. “If we have to do that (fight), Chief Gordon has shown us you can surprise or disarm an assailant with an object. Grab anything you’ve got ... a stapler or book ... anything you’ve got and be prepared and charge him,” Gilbert said. “Maybe he can be distracted by having things thrown at him, and you can limit injuries and loss of life. It won me over.” It also won over the university’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which is distributing 2,500 hockey pucks to its members and students, according to WDIV-TV. The union is selling hockey pucks to raise funds to equip all campus classroom doors with locks that can be used without leaving the room in the event of an emergency. The unending wave of mass shootings targeting students also is prompting other ideas that don’t involve firearms. Pennsylvania’s Blue Mountain School District in March equipped all of its classrooms with a five-gallon bucket of rocks. Anyone attempting a school shooting, the superintendent said, “will be stoned.” Meanwhile, sales of bulletproof backpacks reportedly are soaring.

In addition to being president of the borough, Adams is a 22-year veteran and retired captain at the NYPD — and a Democrat. What did he say? During a Sunday news conference outside a Jewish family services center in the Midwood neighborhood, which holds one of New York City's highest concentrations of Orthodox Jews, Adams said that it's important to protect one another in the wake of the Pittsburgh mass killing, the New York Times reported, A mass murderer opened fire on congregants on Saturday at The Tree of Life Synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, killing 11 people and injuring several more. Authorities filed multiple charges, including hate crime charges, against the suspect. ""I used to carry my gun all the time when I went to church,"" Adams said during the news conference. ""If we have police officers standing in front of churches, they can't say it's wrong for a police officer who's off-duty to be inside churches with a gun. If they're leaving those firearms at home, I now say to them: Stop leaving your firearm home. Do as I do. Bring your firearm to church. ""From now on,"" Adams added, ""I will bring my handgun every time I enter a church or synagogue."" Adams said that while the situation isn't ideal, it's logical. “We have to live in the real universe that we’re in,” Adams explained. “It’s not popular, but it’s right.” Anything else? According to the Times, the department already instructs officers to carry weapons when off-duty. Retired officers are also permitted to carry concealed weapons so long as they pass a marksmanship test. However, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio begs to differ. The mayor delivered remarks about Pittsburgh's deadly massacre on Sunday afternoon at an interfaith gathering at Temple Emanu-El in New York City. ""Houses of worship do not have to have armed guards to be able to practice their religions,"" de Blasio said.

Witnesses said the gunman, Adam Purinton, angrily confronted Kuchibhotla and another Indian national Alok Madasani at an Austin’s Bar & Grill in Olathe, Kansas, yelling “Get out of my country!” Purinton then shot eight rounds inside the restaurant, killing Kuchibhotla and wounding his friend Madasani. A third man, identified as Kansas resident Ian Grillot, was also shot after he tried to stop Purinton outside the bar. Before shooting, Purinton reportedly asked the men, who he thought were Iranian, about their immigration status. When he was located by police, at a bar more than 80 miles away from the crime scene, he told officers he had killed “two Middle Eastern men.” In May, Purinton agreed to a plea deal that recommended the maximum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the hate crime and firearm offenses against him. In turn, prosecutors agreed to not pursue a death sentence. “No matter who you are, what you believe, or how you worship, you should be able to live without fear of becoming a victim of hate crimes, We hope today’s sentencing brings some closure for the victims and their families,” U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister for the District of Kansas said Tuesday in a statement. The new sentence comes on top of a separate life sentence given to Purinton after he pleaded guilty to state charges of murder and attempted murder. All the counts are to be served consecutively, according to court documents. Here’s what else we know. Prosecutors have pointed to an earlier incident weeks before the shooting In its statement today, the Justice Department said that Purinton “admitted in open court” at his federal guilty-plea hearing months ago “that he targeted and shot Kuchibhotla and Madasani because of their race, color, and national origin.” In a statement from the department in May, prosecutors also pointed to a separate incident weeks before the shooting. Purinton happened to be at Austin’s Bar & Grill at the same time as Kuchibhotla and Madasani, sitting by himself in the bar area while the two Indian men were having a drink on the patio. All three were known to frequent the restaurant after work. “Noticing the two men, Purinton commented to a regular sitting at the bar, ‘Did you see the terrorists on the patio?'” according to the statement. How did the shooting happen? On the evening of Feb. 22, 2017, Purinton was sitting by himself on the front patio of Austin’s Bar & Grill. Kuchibhotla and Madasani were also sitting nearby. He then approached to two men, demanding to know their immigration statuses. “Out of the blue comes this weird-looking gentleman, I say weird-looking because he had anger on his face,” Madasani, 32, later told The New York Times. “I did not hear what he was saying instantly, but I saw the look on Srinivas’s face change drastically. I looked at Adam and he walked towards me, he came to me and said, ‘Are you here legally?’” According to DOJ, Purinton poked Kuchibhotla in the chest, calling him a “terrorist” and other racist epithets. Witnesses at one point heard Purinton shout: “Get out of my country!” Ian Grillot, 24, and another bar patron interceded and escorted Purinton out of the bar. “Everybody kept coming up to us saying ‘This is not what we represent, you guys belong here.'” “Everybody kept coming up to us saying ‘This is not what we represent, you guys belong here,’” Madasani recounted for the Times, saying that other patrons assured them that he and his friend were welcomed at the bar. Purinton, however, drove home to retrieve a semi-automatic pistol. He changed into a different shirt and wore a blue and white scarf, all in an effort to “disguise his identity,” the DOJ said. About 30 minutes later, he returned and shot eight rounds at Kuchibhotla and Madasani on the patio. Four of the bullets struck Kuchibhotla, who later died from his injuries. Madasani was shot once, but survived. As Purinton fled the scene, Grillot tried to catch him. Purinton shot Grillot, who also survived the attack. After the shooting, Purinton “stated over the phone to a friend, and later in person to a bartender, that he had just killed some Iranians,” the DOJ said. The fallout The attack raised concerns about anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S. and even caught the attention of Indian officials. They and local media wondered if America was a safe place for Indians. Sunayana Dumala, Kuchibhotla’s widow, addressed this in court today via a statement that was read by a prosecutor. Dumala wrote that it was “extremely painful” to face the gunman. She did address Purinton directly in the statement: “If you could have kept your anger inside and spoke to my husband softly, Srinu would have been more than happy to share his background and help you understand that not every brown skinned person is suspicious or evil, but kind, smart and contributing to America,” she wrote. “Instead you chose to rage and bully in anger and when you were stopped, you decided to take their lives,” she added. None of the victims were present for the sentencing, The Kansas City Star reported. In a video produced by the Star after Purinton’s sentencing in May, Dumala said the “murder of my husband will not bring back Srinu to me, but it will send out a very strong message that hate is never acceptable.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions also called the hate crime “detestable” in today’s statement. “While we cannot undo the irreparable harm that this defendant has done, some measure of justice for the victims’ families has been achieved. Such hateful crimes will remain a priority for the Department of Justice,” he said.

Diane Black must be watching some crazy violent porn, it seems. (Photo: Aaron Bernstein / Reuters) Does anyone know what kind of porn Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) is watching? Whatever it is, the 67-year-old Black, who is running for governor of Tennessee, said it’s a “big part” of what is driving the spike in school shootings. During a meeting last week with local pastors, Black raised the issue of gun violence in schools and why it keeps happening. “Pornography,” she said. “It’s available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there,” she continued. “All of this is available without parental guidance. I think that is a big part of the root cause.” Here’s an audio of her remarks, which she made during a listening session with ministers at Safe Harbor of Clarksville, Tennessee. Black didn’t clarify what it is about porn that she thinks is leading to school massacres. Her congressional spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond naughty movies, Black said school shootings are on the rise because of the “deterioration of the family,” mental illness and violent movies. There have been 23 shootings of some type this year on the campuses of K-12 schools or colleges. Of those at the K-12 schools, nine involved a gun being discharged and people being injured or killed, including a Friday shooting in Indiana school that left a teacher and a student injured. Contrary to Black’s take, experts say poor social, economic and cultural conditions are primary drivers of gun violence. Enacting policies to improve those conditions for people, along with reducing access to firearms, would go a long way in stemming mass shootings, they say. These actions are “far more effective than all the police, doctors and hospitals combined, and intervening only after tragedies have struck,” said professors James Gilligan of New York University and Bandy Lee of Yale University, both experts on violence.

1194,1194,75,http://www.yahoo.com/news/day-mass-shooting-held-another-150257669.html,"The Day After Jacksonville's Mass Shooting, They Held Another Gaming Tournament","(Photo: Andy Campbell/HuffPost) JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ― On Monday night, a group of gamers met up at a local arcade and bar for a casual Super Smash Bros. tournament. It wasn’t anything fancy; a few guys and gals hooted and hollered over beers in the corner of the bar, duking it out in pairs of two, either in front of a tiny TV or a projector screen. Some were regulars, who’d been schlepping their controllers and consoles to this King Street venue since it was a laundromat and bar, well before last year, when it became a dedicated barcade called Keg & Coin. Others were just curious and asked to hop in for a quick round of Smash. It was like a lot of other Jacksonville gaming events: smaller affairs that happen almost nightly and usually take place at one of three mainstay arcades in town, or at a less formal locale like someone’s apartment, where this competitive gaming community got its roots. But of course, this night was different. Some of the folks watching the tournament wore shirts or pins bearing the name GLHF ― the arcade just over two miles away at Jacksonville Landing where, less than 24 hours prior, a mass shooting at a Madden tournament left three dead and another 11 wounded. Keg & Coin, then, was the obvious setting for them to gather and mourn together; to revel; to plot their next steps; to just get their mind off things. “We needed somewhere to get together and hang out ― now this is one of the only places to do that,” said Joshua “Tyger” Campbell, 35, who’s been hosting competitions in town for nearly two decades. “In Jacksonville, this scene used to be so underground. But in the past three to five years we’ve had so much community organizing and so many events that we’re stronger. We have so many places now where gamers feel safe to congregate.” They also wanted to point out the strength of this community. Campbell said he was excited that a national gaming tournament was being held at one of his local haunts. It signaled that the community he’d helped to start, with small Dance Dance Revolution tournaments held back in 2003, was thriving. Story continues But then came the shooting, one that would undoubtedly change the message about his community. This was, after all, a shooting at a video game tournament, and gaming has been a punching bag and a boogeyman for politicians since shooting at Columbine. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has continued that storied tradition, vowing earlier this year to look into the connection between video games and mass shootings. Surely, this real-world, violent event would breed more mischaracterizations about video game culture. “It’s just heartbreaking,” said Mark Ronan, 22, who organizes gaming events across the city. “GLHF is here so we can have a place to hold awesome events like the Madden tournament. One of Jacksonville’s opportunities to shine in the esports world was soiled, and made headlines for all the wrong reasons.” The people HuffPost spoke to Monday ― gaming advocates and activists, family and friends of those victims still hospitalized ― wanted to paint a different picture of local gaming. They’ve spent years fostering a culture of charity, entertainment and competition that extends well beyond the shooting at Jacksonville Landing. ’This Is His Dream’ Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo poses with Florida Gov. Rick Scott from his hospital bed in Jacksonville. (Photo: Courtesy of Sujeil Lopez) At the University of Florida Health medical center, Sujeil Lopez told reporters that she used to get upset when her son, 26-year-old Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo, played video games for a dozen hours a day or more where he grew up in New York City. “I used to get mad,” she said. “My husband used to say, ‘He could be outside doing a lot worse, leave him alone!’ I used to be so furious. But he went to high school, went to college, and he’s a good man.” Anselimo now makes a living playing NBA 2K competitively and boasts a sponsorship from the Milwaukee Bucks. Lopez created a Twitter account just to follow and support his career. She’s fully on board. “This is his dream ― his life,” Lopez said, a life that was put on hold when her son was shot three times on Sunday, once in the chest, once in the hip and again in his right hand. Lopez spoke to reporters as he went through surgery on that hand, a procedure which would decide whether he could continue his career. “As a mother you want your child to be brave,” she said. “If he can’t play and he can’t work, his life would be changed forever. ... But look forward to seeing him again. This is not the last you’ll see of oLARRY, I promise you that!” In the same hospital where Lopez spoke, another group of friends and family was waiting on Chris “Dubby” McFarland to recover. The world-renowned Madden player was grazed in the head by a bullet on Sunday. His friend, John Washington, said outside the ER that McFarland’s gaming community, and sense of safety, had been “invaded.” “He’s very emotional, his whole family is emotional. He’s a soldier, but now it’s like, where in America can you go and feel safe anymore?” Washington said. “The gamers really appreciated this event coming to town. This was just so catastrophic for all of them and the Jacksonville community as a whole.” McFarland, he said, was expected to be released from the hospital sometime this week. But his side career in gaming may be put on hold. ‘Gaming’s Not Going Anywhere’ From left to right: Kyle Schmisek, Joshua Campbell and Mark Ronan, at Keg & Coin in Jacksonville. (Photo: Andy Campbell/HuffPost) There’s rehabilitation to be done, but luckily for the gamers in town, there’s already a network in place to do that. Before the shooting, they had Games Art And Music, a gaming culture company that melds local entertainment with events; the Jacksonville chapter of Extra Life, which raises money for local pediatric programs through gaming events; and locals like Campbell and Ronan, who are already preparing to host charity events for their people. “A lot of people have questions about how they can help, or how we can increase safety at our events ... it encourages me,” Ronan said. “We have to bring everyone back together to show that something like this isn’t going to stop us from having a good time and doing what we love.” Kyle Schmisek, 32, who hosts trivia at GLHF, said calls were rolling in from people wanting to donate to the arcade and various victims’ funds. Over the course of 24 hours, he went from a local organizer in gaming to a national one. “It needs to be done so I do it,” he said. “I’ve been sitting around waiting to do something other than just donate, so I’m here to help. But there’s still a lot to be done. We want to help these families, and we’re still working on that.” Schmisek, Campbell and Ronan sat around a table outside Keg & Coin as the Smash Bros. tournament wrapped up, talking shop and devising plans on what to do next. When asked whether the shooting changed anything for them in terms of their involvement in the scene, they each laughed. “This is my livelihood,” Ronan said. “I work at a game shop, I host events, I travel for them. I put a lot of my effort into Smash. I wouldn’t give it up for anything.” Campbell agreed. “Gaming’s not going anywhere for me,” he said. Love HuffPost?

410,410,455,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~/564308486/_/usatoday-newstopstories~Exclusive-Democrats-funding-spike-in-gun-control-ads-this-election-cycle/,Exclusive: Democrats fund spike in gun control ads this election cycle,"Correction: This story has been updated to remove an incorrect reference to the location of the National Rifle Association headquarters. WASHINGTON – Candidates across the country and allied outside groups are seizing on the issue of guns in advertising this election cycle, but with a twist: More spots now promote gun control than oppose it. That messaging represents a reversal from the last midterm cycle in 2014 and even 2016, when the combined total of pro-gun-rights spots in governors, House and Senate races eclipsed those touting restrictions on guns, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from Kantar Media. The shift follows a rash of mass shootings, including the killing of 17 students and staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School six months ago Tuesday. Democrats are driving the surge in advertising favoring gun control as polling shows the public generally supports stricter laws covering the sale of firearms and overwhelmingly supports expanded background checks. It could be a gamble, given that curbing access to guns has long been considered the third rail of politics. For decades, prominent Democratic candidates, especially in battleground states, have sought to reassure voters of their support for protections under the Second Amendment for the right to bear arms. In 2018, however, candidates and outside groups – particularly in House and governors races – are flooding the airwaves with pointed and sometimes dramatic messages. “I’m running for governor because I’m a parent who will not stop at anything until we make our gun laws stronger and our children safe,” says Philip Levine, a candidate in Florida’s Democratic gubernatorial primary, which has drawn the largest number of spots favoring gun-control. From Jan. 1 through Aug. 6, the total number of spots in governors, House and Senate races favoring gun control outpaced those opposed to it, representing about 59 percent of the total spots that took an explicit position in the gun debate. That's up from 31 percent in 2016 and 11 percent in 2014. Overall in those races, there were about 82,000 pro-gun-control spots, mostly by Democrats, and about 57,500 anti-gun-control spots, mostly by Republicans, this year so far. Another batch of more than 19,000 “miscellaneous” spots by both parties this year mentioned or showed a gun without taking a position. The pro-gun-control spots this year had 81 sponsors, compared to 72 for anti-gun-control spots – also a reversal from the two previous cycles when anti-gun-control spots had a higher number of sponsors than pro-gun-control spots. Spots considered ""pro-gun-control"" may call for increased restrictions on guns or opposition to the National Rifle Association while ""anti-gun-control"" ads may express support for the Second Amendment, the NRA or the freedom to bear arms, according to Kantar, which tracked the spot count or the number of times ads have aired. For instance, GOP Georgia gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp, who has run the most anti-gun-control spots, made waves during his primary with an ad showing him pointing a shotgun toward a teenager named “Jake” who wanted to date his daughter. He announced his approval when he discovered Jake met Kemp’s qualifications: “Respect” and “a healthy appreciation for the Second Amendment, sir.” Something 'flipped' Democrats have long tried to counter such messaging and attacks from the National Rifle Association by showing an affinity for hunters and expressing support for Second Amendment rights. In 2004, for example, John Kerry, appearing in camouflage, took his presidential campaign to a duck blind. And President Obama, in an appeal to the heartland in 2008, supported a Supreme Court decision overturning a ban on guns in Washington, D.C. That came after he angered Midwestern voters by saying at a fundraiser that they get bitter and ""cling to guns or religion."" Something ""flipped,"" at least for some politicians, after former Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., lost her seat in 2016 following her vote against an expansion of background checks, said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, vice president for social policy and politics at the center-left think tank, Third Way. That same cycle, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., won his election after touting his work on the background check bill as a strategy to mobilize suburban women. ""All of a sudden they were like, 'Oh, being against some of these commonsense reforms can actually hurt me and being for them can be good,"" Erickson Hatalsky said. In House races – a good gauge for comparison, since they happen in every district, every two years – pro-gun-control spots this year represented about 67 percent of those with explicit messages on guns, compared to 26 percent in 2016 and 6 percent in 2014. All but one of those ads in favor of gun control this year were funded by Democrats. “We have never seen this many gun-safety ads being run and especially not this early on in the cycle,” said Isabelle James, political director for Giffords, a gun-control group co-founded by former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. “Voters are demanding leadership on the issue of gun safety, and the candidates are responding.” More: 3D-printed guns might be inevitable More: 'NRA has got to go': Protesters Only in the Senate races this year did pro-gun-rights spots – all aired by Republicans – outpace pro-gun-control spots. Democrats instead aired more miscellaneous gun-related messages in Senate races than those promoting gun control. This approach makes ""perfect sense"" for Democrats when looking at where the competitive Senate races are this year, said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist and former Republican National Committee spokesman Senate Democrats haven't had competitive primaries this cycle, but they face a challenging November, defending 10 Senate seats in states that President Donald Trump won. States like Missouri, Indiana and North Dakota have large rural populations where voters remain opposed to gun control, Conant said. For Senate Democrats running for re-election in red states, their party's emphasis on gun control this cycle could be ""awkward,"" he said. “Gun control polls well in urban enclaves, but the further you get from a big city, the less support you’re going to find for it,” Conant said. “It’s a real liability for Senate Democrats if gun control emerges as a national issue in the midterms.” Suburban vs. rural voters But while the Senate's geographical battleground is more rural and Midwestern, most key House races are in suburban districts former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton won in 2016, Erickson Hatalsky said. “Republicans are on defense on guns in most of the House races, because the suburban women who will decide those elections strongly support commonsense gun-safety laws,” Erickson Hatalsky said. “The terrain is different in the Senate, given the states that are up, and both parties may worry they have something to lose from leaning in on guns in the key Senate races.” In a Northern Virginia district near the nation's capital, Democratic House candidate Jennifer Wexton kicked off one ad by highlighting her fight as a state senator for universal background checks for gun purchases. Wexton, who is running against GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock, said she’ll work in Congress to ban bump stocks and high-capacity magazines. The message makes sense, considering a Public Policy Polling survey following last year’s Virginia governor’s race showed the gun issue was an important deciding factor in the election of Democrat Ralph Northam and that 60 percent of Virginians want stronger gun laws. Comstock has an “A” rating from the NRA and has been among the top recipients of NRA funds in the past. She is also considered among the most vulnerable House Republicans in a district Clinton won by 10 percentage points. “I’ll show Donald Trump how progressive we are in Virginia,” Wexton said in her ad. Pro-gun-control ads ranked highest – fifth – among issues in ads for Democratic gubernatorial races, driven by large ad buys in Florida followed by California. Such ads ranked seventh among issues highlighted in advertising in Democratic House races. Rather than talking about “gun control,” James said most candidates’ messages use other terms. They’re talking about gun safety, strengthening gun laws, making communities safer and standing up to the gun lobby. “Gun control,” she said, is a term that’s been co-opted by the gun lobby and “weaponized” against candidates who use it. “Candidates have found a new way to talk to voters about the policies that they know voters support without suggesting that they oppose the Second Amendment or the right of responsible gun owners to bear arms,” she said.

The latest mass shooting, at the Florida high school has some pondering the improbable: Could this one actually bring some measure of change? (Michael Laughlin/South Florida Sun-Sentinel via AP, File) PARKLAND, Fla. (AP) -- The progression has become numbingly repetitive — mass bloodshed unleashed by a gunman, followed by the stories of the fallen, the funerals, the mourning, the talking heads and the calls for change that dwindle into nothingness. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, though, has some pondering the improbable: Could this latest carnage actually lead to gun reforms? Alongside the familiar refrains stemming from earlier shootings, the Feb. 14 attack in Parkland, Florida, came with something else: young survivors immediately pleading for nationwide action. They have led walk-outs, confronted politicians and garnered the support of celebrities, linking their sorrowful, eloquent, outraged voices to the gun debate. """"Our kids have started a revolution,"""" Stoneman Douglas teacher Diane Wolk Rogers said during a CNN-sponsored forum Wednesday. In the aftermath of the violence that claimed 17 lives, students have piled into buses and crashed a meeting of lawmakers in Tallahassee. They've relentlessly badgered Florida Sen. Marco Rubio about his support from the National Rifle Association. They've rejected President Trump's condolences, calling for action over words. To many advocates for gun control, the moment feels more profound than any since the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where 20 first-graders and six adults were fatally shot, spurring the most serious congressional gun debate in years. """"The mantra just became if we couldn't do it after Newtown, if we couldn't do it after however many 6-year-olds were killed, it's never going to happen,"""" said Dave Cullen, the author of """"Columbine,"""" which chronicles the 1999 shooting at the Colorado high school of the same name. """"Then this happened,"""" Cullen said, """"and everything changed."""" Parkland is a well-to-do suburb, with a median household income more than twice the national average. Stoneman Douglas is a top-tier public school under the state rating system, where most students take advanced-placement classes and the curriculum includes yoga and culinary arts. Charles Zelden, a professor of history and political science at Nova Southeastern University in nearby Fort Lauderdale, said the students speaking out in the shooting's aftermath """"come from a tradition of being heard and are angry enough right now that they won't stand for not being heard."""" """"They're used to the idea that they're going to make a difference, that people are going to listen to them,"""" Zelden said. Cullen wonders whether the Parkland attack indicates that it's not the number of deaths or level of outrage that a shooting evokes, but """"whether it's the right group of people with the right standing and the right set of abilities that picks up the ball and runs with it."""" He's been awed that the tragedy produced not just one well-spoken young student activist, but a deep bench of them. Emma Gonzalez stirred a huge crowd with shouts of """"Shame on you!"""" directed at lawmakers. David Hogg has emerged as a media star, giving poised interview after interview. Sarah Chadwick, whose angry tweet to Trump went viral, stirred those gathered in the state Capitol rotunda with what she promised was a revolution on behalf of fallen friends. """"Never again should a child be afraid to go to school,"""" she said. """"Never again should students have to protest for their lives."""" Andy Pelosi, a co-chair of the Florida Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, has spent the past two decades fighting for gun control and watching in despair as a stream of tragedies seemed to bring little meaningful change. He, likewise, was struck by students' collective response. """"I'd like to think this is different,"""" Pelosi said, noting that the students' impassioned actions are helping galvanize a movement, even if they face formidable odds. """"And if you look at our history, the main social movements in our country have been fueled by students,"""" Pelosi said. In matching a $500,000 donation by George and Amal Clooney to the students' planned marches against gun violence, Oprah Winfrey compared the teens to the Freedom Riders of the 1960s, who rode buses into southern states in protest of racial segregation — and others shared that sentiment. Jacob Udo-Udo Jacob, a professor at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania who studies social media-fueled activism, said the students have a chance to stir something equally profound. Jacob cited Rosa Parks' arrest in the fight for civil rights and street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in Tunisia, which led to the Arab Spring. """"Any movement, historically, it's down to narratives, how the movement is framed,"""" Jacob said. The teens don't agree on all issues, but most want AR-15s banned and the age for buying rifles in Florida raised to 21, as it is for handguns. Many want all semi-automatic rifles banned. Uniformly, they want stronger background checks so people like the 19-year-old shooter, who was known to be mentally unstable and violent, cannot buy guns. Their message seems to already be having at least some effect, with Trump, Rubio and Gov. Rick Scott all taking some steps toward greater gun regulation. Rubio said his visit to Stoneman Douglas is what prompted him to change his stance on large-capacity magazines. Alongside the reasons for hope, though, have been signs of the tough road ahead. Some conservatives have portrayed the teens as pawns being exploited to take away constitutional rights, with the NRA insisting that liberals want to ban all guns. Far-right voices have even sought to advance the lie that some of the students are """"crisis actors,"""" essentially paid puppets helping advance an anti-gun agenda. """"Everything they're doing is right out of the Democrat Party's various playbooks,"""" Rush Limbaugh said of the students on his show Monday. To Dr. Allen Konis, whose son is a freshman at Stoneman Douglas, the students are so inspiring that """"even their enemies are taking notice."""" ''They are worried, and they should be,"""" Konis said, """"because they are going to start a real movement in this country."""" After watching Virginia Tech and Orlando and Las Vegas and so many other places become mile markers in the thwarted march to pass significant federal gun laws, the voices of Parkland's teens are bringing hope to advocates craving change. """"Nobody's going to stop these kids,"""" said Mike McFadden, a 59-year-old retired police officer who drove several hours from his home in Indialantic to visit Stoneman Douglas, where a makeshift memorial of 17 white crosses is surrounded by mounds of flowers. Alissa Parker, who co-founded Safe and Sound Schools after her daughter Emilie was killed at Sandy Hook, said the Stoneman Douglas students simply want to feel safe. It makes her remember how Emilie would run to protect her little sisters if they ever felt scared. """"I look at them,"""" Parker said, """"and I'm inspired."""" ___ Sedensky reported from New York.

In a lawsuit, the NRA alleges that Cuomo and state regulators are seeking to “deprive the NRA and its constituents of their First Amendment rights to speak freely about gun-related issues and defend the Second Amendment.” At issue is a campaign by the Democratic governor to discourage insurance companies and financial firms from working with the NRA. The NRA claims that what it describes as New York’s “blacklisting” would “imminently” deprive it of basic banking and other financial services “essential to the NRA’s corporate existence and its advocacy mission.” In its court filing, the NRA said that Cuomo and state regulators “seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional-rights advocates,” adding that “if their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed.” Cuomo scoffed at the NRA’s lawsuit on Friday. “New York will not be intimidated by the NRA’s frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda,” he said. The state is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit with New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood downplaying the group’s concerns. Although Underwood acknowledged that Cuomo and the NRA have a “longstanding history of strong disagreement” on gun control, she said the lawsuit did not allege that New York “directly inhibited the NRA from expressing its opposition to gun regulation. Instead, it presents a speculative and implausible ‘parade of horribles’.” Twitter users, for their part, knew exactly how to respond to the NRA’s tale of woe: “Thoughts and prayers.” Twitter was suddenly filled with well-wishers for the organization who repeated what has become the cliché phrase that gun advocates use whenever there is a mass shooting.

Casey L. Jones, aged 30, is accused of firing more than a dozen shots into the ceiling and walls of the room. At least one of the rounds hit a residence across the street while a family of three was at home, the Knoxville News Sentinel first reported, citing an arrest warrant. There were no injuries in the incident, but Jones was charged with four counts of reckless endangerment involving a deadly weapon. He was arrested and released on $8,000 bond. The incident was reported at just after 1:30 a.m. Wednesday in North Knox County. The home is on the 5100 block of Magic Lantern Drive. A woman who was in the residence at the time reportedly told police officers that there had been no trouble prior to the shots. The arrest warrant stated: ""She stated that no argument had taken place, but the arrestee was playing Xbox when he suddenly had a breaking point and began screaming at the game. He smashed the gaming console with his fist, causing him to act out in more rage. ""The victim then told officers [Jones] went upstairs to the bedroom and began firing rounds through the ceiling and walls, but never pointed the firearm at her. The arrestee made threats of harming himself and has a history of making those same threats, according to the victim."" The woman in the home was not named by the sheriff's department. According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, citing the warrant, police found 16 shell casings in the bedroom. The news outlet reported that Jones admitted to investigators that he had used a Springfield XDS handgun to fire some bullets into the ceiling. He then used a separate gun—a Springfield XDM—and fired more bullets into the surrounding walls. One of those bullets flew through a window and struck the family home. Two weapons were seized by law enforcement. It remains unknown what game Jones was playing. He will appear in court on November 14. In September, a New York man was arrested after allegedly threatening to kill an 11-year-old boy who beat him at Fortnite, an online multiplayer game in the battle royale genre.

The meeting between US President Donald Trump and the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) trade group comes less than a month after a teenaged gunman bearing a semi-automatic weapon shot dead 17 people at his former Florida high school. In the aftermath of the attack Trump pointed to video games as a possible contributing factor to the firearms violence plaguing the nation. ""We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed,"" the Republican leader said. ""And also video games. I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts."" But the ESA says gaming is ""plainly"" not at fault, wielding data showing no established link between games and violence in the flesh. ""Like all Americans, we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States,"" the ESA said in response to an AFP inquiry about the upcoming White House meeting. ""Video games are plainly not the issue: entertainment is distributed and consumed globally, but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation."" Video games are calculated to be a $100 billion a year global business by market intelligence firm NewZoo. - White House rematch - Thursday's meeting comes five years after Joe Biden, then vice president, met with the ESA, heads of major video game companies, and researchers as the nation grappled with Connecticut's Sandy Hook massacre that saw 20 primary school-age children gunned down. Following that shooting the National Rifle Association singled out video games as the true danger to society. ""There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows violence against its own people,"" said the NRA's Wayne LaPierre, blaming ""vicious violent video games"" as well as ""bloodsoaked films."" But gaming industry veteran Mark DeLoura -- who attended the Biden meeting and later spent two years as a White House senior adviser for digital media -- said that ""if anything, it seems like it has gotten clearer there is no correlation."" ""All of our research related to games is there, Trump would just have to ask for it,"" he said. ""That makes me mad; one administration should learn from another."" Both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have taken a stance in recent years against children and teens playing violent video games. But a rising number of academics question the evidence of a link between gaming and aggression, and more than 200 scholars joined to speak out against an APA report affirming such a connection. - 'Gut-feelings' vs 'facts' - It is not the first time video games have come under scrutiny: a high-profile 1993 congressional hearing spearheaded by Democratic senators targeted games including ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Night Trap"" for violent play, with some lawmakers saying the games encouraged or desensitized minors to brutality and bloodshed. A later effort by California officials to ban sales of violent video games to children was struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2011 on the grounds that, like books and films, games are protected by constitutional rights to free speech. DeLoura said blaming video games that feature brutal play might stem from the ""gut-feelings"" of adults watching children engage in virtual battles, rather than hard data. ""What's causing shootings is guns are so accessible that when you have an impulse, you can act on it,"" he said. ""Does it have to be more complicated than that?"" With a gun culture that runs deep, America is deadlocked over how to stem the scourge of mass shootings. But video games, the industry holds, are innocent. ""Blaming video games for violence in the real world is no more productive than blaming the news media for bringing violent crimes into our homes night after night,"" the ESA says on its website. Video game play is booming as spectator sport, with fans flocking to arenas for tournaments as well as watching matches online. The association notably cites data trends showing that violent crime, particularly by young people, has declined in the US since the early 1990s -- even as video games have flourished. ""The rise of this conversation again isn't about facts, it isn't about research,"" said DeLoura in a recent blog post. ""It's about politics.""",Video game addiction Video Games World Health Organization  Mental disorder  Game Health Disease Mental health,A video game video game.,"Some critics believe violent video games might be influencing the behavior of young people (AFP Photo/THOMAS SAMSON) San Francisco (AFP) - Video game industry representatives will trek to Washington Thursday to persuade lawmakers that virtual violence does not trigger real-world lashing out, amid a reignited gun debate in the wake of the latest horrific school shooting.",""" we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the u.s., "" says joe biden.

77,77,110070,https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-orlando-nightclub-shooter-20160612-snap-story.html,"Orlando nightclub gunman remembered as abusive, homophobic and racist","His ex-wife said he was unstable and beat her. His father said he spoke openly of his disgust for gay people. A co-worker recalled him as a virulent racist. Those who knew Omar Mateen, the 29-year-old Florida security guard who carried out the worst mass shooting in American history, described him Sunday as an angry and disagreeable person. But the roots of his rage – and much else about his assault on a gay nightclub in Orlando – remained unclear. Was the killing of 50 motivated by the homophobia Mateen spewed to his family and co-workers? Or by the allegiance to Islamic State that he professed to a 911 operator the night of the attack? Or by a mental unraveling that drove his wife away after four months of marriage? And what lay behind his choice of a target: a Latin dance party at a club 130 miles from his home? Advertisement President Obama acknowledged the unanswered questions about Mateen at the White House, but noted, “What is clear is that he was a person filled with hatred.” Mateen’s outbursts and possible connection to terrorists attracted the attention of the FBI twice in recent years. Agents questioned Mateen, the American-born son of Afghan immigrants, twice in 2013 after being told his co-workers suspected he might be linked to terrorists. The colleagues reported that Mateen had made frightening claims that he had ties to terror groups, including Al Qaeda, a U.S. law enforcement official said. The Wall Street Journal reported that he also told colleagues he had connections with the brothers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. FBI agents closed the 2013 investigation after they determined that Mateen didn’t understand how the groups operated and he told investigators that he had been lying and blustering about his terrorist ties. Advertisement “Ultimately we were unable to verify the substance of his comments and the investigation was closed,” FBI Assistant Special Agent in Charge Ronald Hopper said. Agents talked to him again in 2014 after learning he had attended the same mosque as Moner Mohammad Abusalha, a 22-year-old Floridian who joined a branch of Al Qaeda in Syria and killed himself and more than a dozen government soldiers in a truck bombing that year. The FBI conducted an intensive investigation into Abusalha. The investigation into Mateen’s relationship with Abusalha revealed that the two men probably knew each other by sight but were barely acquaintances. Hopper told reporters in Orlando that agents “determined the contact was minimal and did not constitute a substantive relationship or a threat at that time.” The FBI had placed Mateen on the terrorist watchlist during the investigations but removed him after he was cleared, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Advertisement Mateen was born in New York and grew up in Florida. He lived in Fort Pierce, about a 10-minute drive from his parents’ home in Port Saint Lucie. Current and former neighbors described the area as ethnically mixed with immigrants from Haiti, Guatemala and the Middle East. His father, Seddique Mateen, is known in the global Afghan community from a TV show he hosts on a satellite network, Payam-e-Afghan TV, about the national politics of his homeland and the ongoing conflict with Pakistan. In one clip from the program, “Durand Jirga,” posted online last year, the elder Mateen called the Taliban “our warrior brothers” in opposing Pakistan. The network owner, Omar Khatab, said the father flew from Florida to California every three months to film broadcasts at the channel’s Canoga Park studio and expressed little interest in Islam. “He is not a religious guy. He’s a secular guy,” Khatab said. “He loves America. He has been here a long time. He was a nice guy. The son, I don’t know about.” Advertisement Mateen’s father told NBC News that the family was not aware he was planning an attack. “We are in shock, like the whole country,” Seddique Mateen said. Omar Mateen met Sitora Yusufiy, the daughter of Uzbek immigrants, online and married her in 2009, but the marriage was short-lived. “After a few months he started abusing me physically, very often, not allowing me to speak to my family,” Yusufiy said at a news conference in Boulder, Colo., where she lives. She said that her parents rescued her after four months and that she and Mateen eventually divorced. Advertisement As their marriage devolved, she said, she grew to believe he was mentally ill. “He was obviously disturbed,” she said. People who knew him said he had a young son, but the age of the child and Mateen’s relationship with the mother was unknown. Mateen was employed since 2007 as a security guard for the international firm G4S, which provides services to corporations, celebrities and foreign governments. Daniel Gilroy, who worked alongside Mateen for about a year as a security guard for a gated community, said he brought a prayer rug and skullcap to work and prayed on his knees during his shifts. Advertisement He didn’t talk about his faith, Gilroy said, but was outspoken in his disdain for African Americans, gays and women, frequently using slurs and sometimes talking about committing violence against them. Once, when he saw an African American man driving past, Gilroy recalled, Mateen said he wished he could “kill all” blacks, referring to them with the N-word. “You meet bigots,” Gilroy said, “But he was above and beyond. He was always angry, swearing, just angry at the world.” Gilroy said that he complained, but that the company did not intervene. Representatives from G4S did not immediately return requests for comment about Gilroy’s remarks. In a statement earlier in the day, the company said, “We are cooperating fully with all law enforcement authorities, including the FBI, as they conduct their investigation.” The company said Mateen underwent company screening and a background check in 2007 and repeated the process in 2013, with no problems. The company was aware of the FBI inquiry. Advertisement Mateen attended the Islamic Center of Fort Pierce, a small mosque with about 150 worshipers, several times a week. Just last Friday, he prayed with his young son. But the center’s imam said he did not really know him. “He was a quiet, shy guy,” Imam Syed Shafeeq Rahman said. “Come last, go first.” The imam said he hadn’t had a conversation with Mateen in a decade and couldn’t reconcile his actions with the teachings of Islam. “In the mosque, there is no extremism,” he said. Mateen’s father told NBC News that he believed homophobia, not religion, led his son to kill. The father recalled a visit to Miami earlier this year where his son became angry with displays of affection by gay men. Advertisement “We were in downtown Miami, Bayside, people were playing music. And he saw two men kissing each other,” Seddique Mateen said. “And then we were in the men’s bathroom and men were kissing each other.” Omar Mateen bought two guns he used in the rampage, an assault-type rifle and a semiautomatic pistol, legally in the last two weeks at a gun store near his home, federal officials said. Near the time he opened fire in the nightclub, Mateen placed a call to 911 and told the operator that he pledged allegiance to Islamic state and specifically mentioned the Tsarnaev brothers, who were responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. In a live broadcast Sunday afternoon on Payam-e-Afghan, the network that aired Mateen’s father’s show, an unidentified man speaking in English expressed dismay at the attacks. Advertisement “It’s not the work of all Afghans. It’s not the work of all Muslims,” he said. “We are so sad this happened especially for those defenseless people gathering in a nightclub pursuing the happiness they wanted to obtain.” His ex-wife had not talked to Mateen for seven years and, reflecting on their time together, said he practiced his faith and showed no signs of interest in radical Islam. He talked about becoming a police officer. But then there was his temper. “When he would get in his tempers, he would express hate toward everything,” she said.

That’s the theory at Oakland University in Auburn Hills, Michigan, where faculty members are being trained to fight school shooters using, among other things, hockey pucks. OU Police Chief Mark Gordon told local station WDIV-TV, the pucks are being given to teachers and students to throw at school shooters and cause a distraction. Gordon knows something of which he speaks. As a former youth hockey coach, he told the Detroit News he was once hit in the head with a puck. It “caused a fair amount of damage to me,” he said. Hockey pucks are perfect for defense, he said, though he acknowledged he knows of no research on using pucks in active shooter situations. They’re heavy enough to cause damage and compact enough to be carried in backpacks, but aren’t considered weapons by law enforcement. “Anything that you can throw that’s heavy and will cause damage, cause injury is the bottom line of what you’re trying to do,” Gordon said, according to the Detroit Free Press. A hockey puck “was just a thing that was suggested that could possibly work, especially when you have 20 or 30 people in a classroom and they all throw hockey pucks at the same time ― it would be quite the distraction.” Faculty member Garry J. Gilbert admitted he was skeptical about the puck plan. “My first reaction was: You are talking about facing an assault weapon and asking us to fight back with hockey pucks? It sounded silly,” Gilbert told the Detroit News. “Then I went through the training session, and it all made sense. None of us want to face an armed assailant. Students will look to us for leadership in a situation like that.” The training encourages the faculty to flee if possible, and hide if not. “If we have to do that (fight), Chief Gordon has shown us you can surprise or disarm an assailant with an object. Grab anything you’ve got ... a stapler or book ... anything you’ve got and be prepared and charge him,” Gilbert said. “Maybe he can be distracted by having things thrown at him, and you can limit injuries and loss of life. It won me over.” It also won over the university’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which is distributing 2,500 hockey pucks to its members and students, according to WDIV-TV. The union is selling hockey pucks to raise funds to equip all campus classroom doors with locks that can be used without leaving the room in the event of an emergency. The unending wave of mass shootings targeting students also is prompting other ideas that don’t involve firearms. Pennsylvania’s Blue Mountain School District in March equipped all of its classrooms with a five-gallon bucket of rocks. Anyone attempting a school shooting, the superintendent said, “will be stoned.” Meanwhile, sales of bulletproof backpacks reportedly are soaring.

113,113,482,http://www.yahoo.com/news/us-crypto-anarchist-sees-3d-printed-guns-fundamental-040318092.html,US 'crypto-anarchist' sees 3D-printed guns as fundamental right,"Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide. A federal court judge blocked Texan Cody Wilson's website on Tuesday by issuing a temporary injunction. Eight states had sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a ""lone wolf"" gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons. Wilson complied with the judge's order and shut down his Defcad website, which he wanted to turn into the ""WikiLeaks of guns."" But by then, the blueprints he had posted -- after President Donald Trump's administration granted him permission to publish in a settlement to end a five-year legal battle -- had been downloaded thousands of times. ""No matter how badly I win or lose, you can download a gun from the internet,"" Wilson told AFP at the headquarters of Defense Distributed, the company he runs out of a modest factory in Texas capital Austin. ""This attempt by these authorities to go into court and stifle this information drove more people to the website to download it and spread it deeper into the internet."" Sporting a pair of gray jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, the 30-year-old with a close-cropped beard wouldn't appear out of place as a tech executive in Silicon Valley. The ideology he says he is driven by is a defense of the US constitution's first and second amendments -- the rights to free speech and to bear arms. Wilson believes the intense media attention he generated cemented one of his principal goals: to use technology and the spread of gun-making information as a permanent bulwark against any future attempts at gun control in the US. ""We believe that the firearm itself, this implement of violence, is an essential component of force, of sovereignty,"" he says. He concedes that what he has done, and still wants to do, ""offends the conscience"" of some people, but he says ""it's never been illegal in this country to make a firearm -- and the way that you make it shouldn't affect that law."" Story continues - Anarchist philosophy - Wilson subscribes to an anarchist philosophy that the free exchange of ideas on the internet -- in its absolute form -- is a check on government. ""It's a politics that predicted WikiLeaks, predicted Bitcoin, predicted anonymous mail and anonymous communications online,"" he says. The law school dropout has dedicated the last five years of his life to the cause of unfettered online access to gun-making information. ""I'm a publisher. At the end of the day, I do many things, but the main thing that I strive to do is to take my information and put it on the internet,"" he says. Defense Distributed, the company Wilson co-founded in 2013 and currently heads, is more than a publishing firm -- it sells actual firearms products. It has created a machine called the ""Ghost Gunner,"" priced at $2,000. Computer code operates the machine, which carves essential components of various firearms to create weapons without serial numbers. - 'Ghost guns' - Such weapons -- called ""ghost guns"" -- are already being made by those who can properly carve metal components. The ""Ghost Gunner"" takes away the need for advanced skill and creates untraceable weapons. The issue is far from academic. The Los Angeles Police Department last month showcased a trove of ""ghost"" weapons it recovered from gang members. Law enforcement cannot trace these weapons if they are used to commit crimes. That is why lawmakers, law enforcement personnel, gun control groups and even Trump himself expressed everything from panic to skepticism this week when Wilson started distributing blueprints online. Those blueprints included his company's own creation, the ""Liberator"" plastic gun -- a sidearm that resembles something seen on science fiction TV shows. The potential impact of Wilson's publication was worldwide. Any country with uncensored access to the internet could see its gun control measures circumvented with a click of a mouse. ""It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that 3D-printed guns are nothing short of a menace to society,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one,"" Gardiner said after the injunction. Wilson also plans to fight, just as he unsuccessfully fought in the courts for five years. The judge that ordered his website shut plans to hold a hearing on the states' lawsuit next week. Wilson put out a call for donations to fund the legal challenge, but is aware that he may be facing a losing battle. ""I believe that duty demands that I continue to fight it,"" he said, while admitting that ""I think I'll waste a lot of money.""",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distortion, at the company’s headquarters in Austin, Tex.","Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide.

1132,1132,10136,http://finance.yahoo.com/news/white-house-weighs-video-game-gun-violence-210950846.html,White House weighs video game link to gun violence,"Some critics believe violent video games might be influencing the behavior of young people (AFP Photo/THOMAS SAMSON) San Francisco (AFP) - Video game industry representatives will trek to Washington Thursday to persuade lawmakers that virtual violence does not trigger real-world lashing out, amid a reignited gun debate in the wake of the latest horrific school shooting. The meeting between US President Donald Trump and the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) trade group comes less than a month after a teenaged gunman bearing a semi-automatic weapon shot dead 17 people at his former Florida high school. In the aftermath of the attack Trump pointed to video games as a possible contributing factor to the firearms violence plaguing the nation. ""We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed,"" the Republican leader said. ""And also video games. I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts."" But the ESA says gaming is ""plainly"" not at fault, wielding data showing no established link between games and violence in the flesh. ""Like all Americans, we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States,"" the ESA said in response to an AFP inquiry about the upcoming White House meeting. ""Video games are plainly not the issue: entertainment is distributed and consumed globally, but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation."" Video games are calculated to be a $100 billion a year global business by market intelligence firm NewZoo. - White House rematch - Thursday's meeting comes five years after Joe Biden, then vice president, met with the ESA, heads of major video game companies, and researchers as the nation grappled with Connecticut's Sandy Hook massacre that saw 20 primary school-age children gunned down. Following that shooting the National Rifle Association singled out video games as the true danger to society. ""There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows violence against its own people,"" said the NRA's Wayne LaPierre, blaming ""vicious violent video games"" as well as ""bloodsoaked films."" But gaming industry veteran Mark DeLoura -- who attended the Biden meeting and later spent two years as a White House senior adviser for digital media -- said that ""if anything, it seems like it has gotten clearer there is no correlation."" ""All of our research related to games is there, Trump would just have to ask for it,"" he said. ""That makes me mad; one administration should learn from another."" Both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have taken a stance in recent years against children and teens playing violent video games. But a rising number of academics question the evidence of a link between gaming and aggression, and more than 200 scholars joined to speak out against an APA report affirming such a connection. - 'Gut-feelings' vs 'facts' - It is not the first time video games have come under scrutiny: a high-profile 1993 congressional hearing spearheaded by Democratic senators targeted games including ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Night Trap"" for violent play, with some lawmakers saying the games encouraged or desensitized minors to brutality and bloodshed. A later effort by California officials to ban sales of violent video games to children was struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2011 on the grounds that, like books and films, games are protected by constitutional rights to free speech. DeLoura said blaming video games that feature brutal play might stem from the ""gut-feelings"" of adults watching children engage in virtual battles, rather than hard data. ""What's causing shootings is guns are so accessible that when you have an impulse, you can act on it,"" he said. ""Does it have to be more complicated than that?"" With a gun culture that runs deep, America is deadlocked over how to stem the scourge of mass shootings. But video games, the industry holds, are innocent. ""Blaming video games for violence in the real world is no more productive than blaming the news media for bringing violent crimes into our homes night after night,"" the ESA says on its website. Video game play is booming as spectator sport, with fans flocking to arenas for tournaments as well as watching matches online. The association notably cites data trends showing that violent crime, particularly by young people, has declined in the US since the early 1990s -- even as video games have flourished. ""The rise of this conversation again isn't about facts, it isn't about research,"" said DeLoura in a recent blog post.

The latest spasm of violence in a year marred by assaults on the nation's schools, the shooting at Santa Fe High School was the latest to test the president's role as national comforter-in-chief. Trump met with more than two dozen people affected by the shooting, and did not publicly share his message for the grieving families and local leaders during a meeting at a Coast Guard base outside Houston. Pamela Stanich — whose 17-year-old son, Jared Black, was among the eight students killed — was one of the parents who met with Trump, presenting him with a family statement and a copy of her son's eulogy. Trump ""met with us privately and showed sincerity, compassion, and concern on making our schools safer across the nation,"" she wrote in a Facebook post after the meeting. ""He spent time talking to the survivors and asking on what happened and what would have made a difference. Changes are coming for the good. Thank you Mr. Trump."" Rhonda Hart, whose 14-year-old daughter, Kimberly Vaughan, was killed at the school, told The Associated Press that Trump repeatedly used the word 'wacky' to describe the shooter and the trench coat he wore. She said she told Trump, ""Maybe if everyone had access to mental health care, we wouldn't be in the situation."" Hart, an Army veteran, said she also suggested employing veterans as sentinels in schools. She said Trump responded, ""And arm them?"" She replied, ""No,"" but said Trump ""kept mentioning"" arming classroom teachers. ""It was like talking to a toddler,"" Hart said. Reporters were not permitted to witness the meeting. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha While the president was in Texas, Trump's school safety commission met outside Washington, part of the president's chosen solution to combat the rising tide of bloodshed after his brief flirtation with tougher gun laws after February's mass killing at a high school in Parkland, Florida went nowhere. A White House spokesman said Trump was ""moved"" by the shooting at Santa Fe High School, which left eight students and two substitute teachers dead. A student faces capital murder charges in the attack. ""These events are very tragic, whenever they happen. And you know, the president wants to extend his condolences and talk about the issue of school safety,"" spokesman Raj Shah told Fox News Channel. Also Thursday, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whom Trump put in charge of the school safety commission, announced a $1 million grant to the Santa Fe school district to help with post-shooting recovery efforts. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Sen. Ted Cruz, both Republicans, greeted Trump after Air Force One landed at a Houston military base. Abbott joined Trump for the short ride in the presidential limousine to a Coast Guard hangar where the meeting took place. Trump then headed to a fundraiser at a luxury hotel in downtown Houston, the first of his two big-dollar events in Texas on Thursday. A White House official did not immediately respond to requests for details about how much money was to be raised, and who was benefiting, from the fundraising events. After 17 teachers and students were killed during a February shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Trump said he would work to improve school safety, but has not called for new gun control legislation. He created the commission to review ways to make schools safer. Trump briefly strayed from gun-rights dogma after the Parkland shooting, but quickly backpedaled. Abbott, a Republican and a staunch gun-rights supporter, has called for schools to have more armed personnel and said they should put greater focus on spotting student mental health problems. He's proposed a few small restrictions on guns since the shooting. Investigators say student Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 17, carried out the attack with a shotgun and pistol that belonged to his father. Classes at Santa Fe High School resumed Tuesday for the first time since the shooting. As the Parkland students became vocal advocates for gun control, embracing their public positions as few school survivors had before, Trump quickly became a focal point for their anger. In Trump's visit to Florida after the shooting, aides kept him clear of the school, which could have been the site of protests, and he instead met with a few victims at a local hospital and paid tribute to first responders at the nearby sheriff's office. There has yet to be a similar outcry for restrictions on firearms from the students and survivors in deep-red Texas. Displaying empathy does not come naturally to Trump, who has been criticized for appearing unfeeling in times of tragedy, including when he sharply criticized a mayor in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of a deadly hurricane and fought with a Gold Star military family. But Trump has at times displayed a softer side. On Wednesday, he returned a hug from an 8-year-old boy with muscular dystrophy who attended a White House event where he signed legislation to give patients the right to try experimental treatments.

We use young people as collateral damage for the Second Amendment, and it’s wrong.” She added, “Shootings like Las Vegas happen in the equivalent of a musician’s office. That’s where we work. So for people to say, ‘Shut up and sing; you don’t have a right to talk about this’: Well, it affects us. This Thousand Oaks shooting happened just 15 miles from where I grew up in Ventura, California. To read that some of the survivors also survived Las Vegas, it’s incomprehensible — the trauma these people have endured.” Both massacres were direct hits on the country music fan base, which she also takes personally, as country music royalty and as someone who had her own run of major country hits in the 1980s — although she cautions that “in some ways, I’m persona non grata in country music. The Americana community has embraced me; I love country music and used to be part of the mainstream, but not anymore. So I can’t pretend to speak for country artists or that community. artists or that community.” Nonetheless, she used the good will she still enjoys among that artist and fan base as occasion to write an op-ed for the New York Times after the Las Vegas shootings last year, titled “Country Musicians, Stand Up to the N.R.A.” Asked by the Atlantic if any mainstream country artists had taken her up on that offer, she responded, “No. There’s a lot of fear. Particularly from younger artists who know the blowback they’ll get. Look at the blowback Taylor Swift got for just telling people to vote. I’ve gotten threats for speaking out. Like I said in the op-ed, people wanted to kill us because we spoke out against gun violence. There’s a level of insanity that’s taken root.” As she often is, Cash was asked to defend her father’s legacy against the idea held by a lot of pro-gun conservatives that he was one of them. “Oh, it’s so ridiculous, and I never use him to support my own agenda,” she said. “But he was on the advisory board of PAX, the anti-gun-violence-against-children organization. So, come on. He had hunting rifles and antique Remingtons, but he didn’t have an arsenal of military weapons, and he never believed in that.” Cash pointed out that she served for a decade on the board of PAX, which “was devoted to protecting children from gun violence. And I met grieving parent after grieving parent until it was crushing me. These secret pockets of the deepest suffering imaginable are scattered throughout the country, and you can go your whole life without knowing they exist. When a child is killed by random gun violence, it shatters so many lives, from the parent to the family to the extended family to the school to the city. The suffering is multigenerational.” Cash’s latest album, “She Remembers Everything,” includes a collaboration with Elvis Costello and Kris Kristofferson on “8 Gods of Harlem,” a song about a child who falls victim to gun violence.

And yet the Seattle nun is a leader of Wall Street rebels. Byron, a member of the Adrian Dominican Sisters, helps faith-based activist investors push large, publicly traded companies to consider their social impact. She researches corporations, develops strategies to persuade them to make changes and recruits like-minded investors to join her. Then she uses that leverage to write to the company or file a shareholder resolution. “When I say that I’ve always been interested in social justice, it isn’t just to know about it and be aware of it, but to bring about change and bring about justice,” Byron said. “We’re looking to change the system.” Their target this year has been America’s gun makers, with some unexpected results. Driven by outrage over the Feb. 14 massacre at a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and backed by some of the country’s largest institutional investors, Byron and a small band of shareholders have forced two firearm manufacturers to produce reports detailing how their guns are used in violent crimes and what the companies are doing to develop safer weapons. The manufacturers did not want to do this, and urged their shareholders to reject the proposals. But both times, first with Sturm Ruger in May and on Tuesday with American Outdoor Brands, a majority sided with the activists. The Ruger booth at the 2016 National Shooting Sports Foundation's Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade (SHOT) Show in Las Vegas. Ethan Miller / Getty Images file Those surprising victories may turn the financial market into a new front in the battle over solutions to gun violence. “Her organization has hit on issues that are relevant not only culturally and socially but also relevant to shareholders,” said Courteney Keatinge, director of environmental, social and governance research at Glass Lewis, a proxy adviser that recommended clients vote for the activists’ proposals. That includes an eye for vulnerabilities to “reputational risk” — changes in the way a company is perceived that can cause its value to suffer. “It’s pretty novel and pretty impressive,” Keatinge said. The votes have also made Byron a luminary among her fellow crusaders, who describe her as a quiet leader: methodical and persistent in her activism but also restrained and compassionate when it comes to dealing with the executives whose minds she hopes to change. “She’ll walk out of a meeting and say to me, ‘I don’t think the CEO looked very good today, how do you think she’s doing?’” said Margaret Weber, the corporate responsibility director for the Congregation of St. Basil, a Toronto-based order of Catholic priests, who has known Byron for 20 years and has watched her negotiate with corporate executives. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha Weber added: “She’s not very complicated. She’s just genuine. Strong and solid.” A CALLING TO ACTIVISM Byron admits she’s no stock market guru. Raised in a small lumber town on the Washington coast, she became a nun after graduating high school in 1960, then taught and served as a principal at Catholic schools. She says that as a student and an educator she felt compelled to find tangible ways to improve people’s lives. “My religion wasn’t just about God and me; my religion called me to be concerned about others, and to work for the common good,” Byron said. That led her, in 1998, to the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, an organization of institutional investors that was formed in the early 1970s to end economic support of the apartheid-based regime in South Africa and has since embraced an array of social and environmental causes. Byron also became director of the Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment, made up of religious communities looking for profitable, and influential, ways to manage their retirement funds and other assets. She learned on the job, with help from members of her coalition who had more experience in financial markets: “socially responsible” asset managers, nonprofits, labor unions. “You really can’t do this work on your own,” Byron said. Through the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, “we have any number of people I can call or email for guidance and have an answer in a few minutes. Our strength is in our partnerships.” ‘WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING’ Byron said she believes their successes this year with firearm companies represent a first step in a process to persuade companies to take a more active role in reducing violence. “We have our toe in the door, but this is going to be a long journey,” Byron said. The effort began two years ago, when Byron floated the idea in a meeting of the Adrian Dominican Sisters’ portfolio advisory board, a group of nuns and lay people who set criteria for the congregation’s investment strategies. “The phenomenon of mass shootings, children dying, people dying because of gun violence, she wasn’t just doing this because of an ideology, but because she was feeling the pain,” Weber, who was at the meeting, recalled. “Judy took the initiative by saying, ‘We need to do something.’” Byron persuaded the Adrian Dominicans to buy gun stocks, and organized other members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility to join her, pooling their holdings in three companies: Dick’s Sporting Goods, a retailer, and two manufacturers, Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, which owns the Smith & Wesson brand. Byron and her fellow activists then wrote to the companies with requests to meet their executives in person. Dick’s was the only to respond, saying it was exploring changes to its firearm policies. THE PARKLAND EFFECT Then came the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland. The public outcry and student activism sparked a new wave of calls for gun control ─ and new pressure on gun retailers and gun makers. Suddenly, Byron and her fellow activists had big institutional investors on their side, including BlackRock, which owned large chunks of shares and endorsed the proposals. That gave them the votes to pass the measures at Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands. In both cases, the companies’ chief executives were defiant, saying the activists couldn’t force them to change their operations. In fact, the companies aren’t required to follow the resolutions. But analysts expect them to comply rather than risk shareholders’ anger. Byron delivered a brief statement to American Outdoor Brands during Tuesday’s online meeting, saying that the company’s weapons were used in the Parkland attack and prior mass shootings. She appealed to the company’s responsibility not only to produce profitable returns for investors but also “to seek to prevent or mitigate human rights impacts that are directly, or indirectly, linked to their products.” Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands did not respond to requests for comment on Byron and the activists. But after Tuesday’s vote, American Outdoor Brands CEO James Debney said the process had become hijacked by a “political agenda.” Such a characterization of Byron isn’t accurate, said Patty Bowman, the executive director at the Intercommunity Peace and Justice Center in Seattle, a social-justice nonprofit that includes Byron’s Northwest Coalition for Responsible Investment. “The American Outdoor Brands people said this is partisan and political. But she’s not that way. She’s reasoned and responsible and committed,” Bowman said. “It’s long, slow work, this shareholder activism work. It takes a lot of determination and persistence.” ‘WE’RE IN THIS FOR THE LONG HAUL’ Next week, Byron will join members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility for a biannual meeting to develop strategy and be honored by the organization for her career of service. They’ll also discuss how to follow up on the success at Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands. Byron knows that Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands are producing their reports begrudgingly. Her team, therefore, will need to keep pressing for change. “We have to decide what our next step is,” Byron said. “Because we’re in this for the long haul too.”",Seattle Nun Sister  Shareholder rebellion  Activist shareholder  Publicly listed company Investment,"Sister Judy Byron, a member of the Adrian Dominican Sisters, helps religious-based activist investors push large, publicly traded companies to consider their social impact.","Sister Judy Byron doesn’t have a degree in finance and, having taken a vow of poverty, doesn’t have much personal use for the stock market.

A sweeping tax bill with the fuel exemption stripped out by the Republicans passed the GOP-controlled House and Senate by wide margins, just days after Delta reacted to the school massacre in Florida by announcing it would no longer offer discount fares to NRA members. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal criticized the Delta controversy as an ""unbecoming squabble"" but said he would sign the broader tax measure in whatever form it passed. Delta, which is based in Atlanta and has 33,000 employees in Georgia, would have been the prime beneficiary of the tax break, estimated to be worth at least $38 million a year to airlines. The political battle at the Georgia Capitol was the latest in the debate over gun control and school safety that flared after the Feb. 14 shooting rampage in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 students and educators dead. Delta did not immediately return messages seeking comment. NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen had no immediate comment. The state Senate's presiding officer, Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, set up the showdown between gun-rights supporters and one of Georgia's biggest private employers when he vowed Monday to stop any tax break that would benefit Delta. ""Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,"" he tweeted. The dispute stirred fears of damage to Georgia's business-friendly reputation, and politicians in several other states seized on the furor in recent days, urging Delta to move its headquarters. ""Hey @delta — Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You're welcome here any time,"" Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, tweeted. The Delta provision barely came up Thursday in either legislative chamber during debate on the underlying tax bill, designed in part to give back to Georgia taxpayers $5.2 billion in extra state revenue expected over the next five years because of the recent federal tax overhaul. Story continues Cagle took a softer tone in celebrating victory Thursday. ""Obviously the political environment does sometimes get a little testy, but in the end, it's all about the product,"" said Cagle, who is running this year to succeed the term-limited governor. ""And the product we have today is something that all of us can be very proud of."" The Senate passed the tax measure 44-10, with Democrats accounting for all of the no votes. The House — which had passed an earlier version with the jet fuel exemption intact before the Delta-NRA controversy erupted — followed with a 135-24 vote. ""It's been strenuous,"" said GOP Sen. Michael Williams, another candidate for governor. ""We've been attacked by the media, we've been attacked by the left. Big corporate has gone after us. And we've stayed strong. We've even stayed strong against our own governor."" House Speaker David Ralston, a Republican, bemoaned the combative tone some had taken toward Delta. But he put some of the blame on the airline, noting the jet fuel exemption wasn't controversial before Delta crossed the NRA. ""I hope they are better at flying airplanes than timing P.R. announcements,"" Ralston said. Among Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift action on guns after the Florida tragedy. She said Delta's decision to end its NRA discounts led her to support the jet fuel tax break. ""The small steps that Delta and Dick's Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,"" Williams said. ""We're the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing."" Dick's Sporting Goods has said it will no longer sell assault-style weapons like the one used in the Florida attack. Critics of the GOP effort to retaliate against Delta have warned it could backfire by harming Georgia's ability to lure businesses — including Amazon, which recently named Atlanta a finalist in its search for a second headquarters. ""It definitely could have an effect when an outside company looks at something that happens this quickly around election time to one of the largest employers in the state,"" said William Hatcher, a professor at Augusta University who studies economic development. ""But will it be the dominant factor? I don't think so."" Delta has helped make Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport the busiest airport in the world.

In the weeks leading up to and following the 2018 midterm elections, a wave of murderous hatred was visited upon communities that contribute to the vibrant tapestry of our nation, but which disciples of white supremacy seek to destroy. From a mail bomber to a grocery store gunman to two mass murders in a two-week span, each of these recent acts of violence is symptomatic of the diseases of bigotry and violence that eat away at our country like a cancer. ADVERTISEMENT Starting on Oct. 22, over a dozen pipe bombs were mailed to the homes and offices of politicians, public figures and news outlets. Two days later, a man attempted to enter a black church in Kentucky with a gun. When his entry was blocked because the church doors were locked, he instead went to a Kroger supermarket where he shot and killed two African-Americans. On Oct. 27, 11 Jews were slaughtered at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue by a man who acted alone, but whose actions were motivated and inspired by anti-Semitic, white supremacist rhetoric. The day after the election, a gunman killed 12 people and himself at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. Less than a week later, police responded to a shooting at a bar outside Chicago and fatally shot the African-American security guard who had subdued the shooter. In recent years, we have suffered far too many scenes such as these, including the massacres at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida; Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida; a Las Vegas concert; and, earlier, the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. The violence of the past month demonstrates the destructive power of hate-mongering demagoguery. It is hatred of the other that lies at the heart of white supremacy. Because of this, the sight of people joining hands across the aisle, across artificial gender constructs, across religious, ethnic and color lines is a threat to those who wish to see an America divided by hate — an America separated by the other. But we know there can be no divisions as we fight bigotry, racism and hate because those corrosive malignancies endanger everything good and right about the American experiment. And yet, combating white supremacy and hate will not be enough, because at the heart of each of these horrors was another, uniquely American, evil: gun violence. The hate that entered through the doors of each school, each store, each club, each church and synagogue, none could have stolen so many lives had its agents not been so fatally armed. Our synagogues and churches are not safe, nor are our movie theaters and schools, our children and our elders. Every conceivable space in American life and every person within our borders has been made a target by unstable and angry people with access to guns. Our identities and communities overlap and intertwine, giving some of us more than one reason to fear: Jews of color, Christian refugees, Muslim Latinos, LGBTQ people of every shade and background. Poverty and gendered violence bring their own threats, each made worse and more terrible by the flood of guns filling our homes and our streets. The outpouring of support that inevitably meets this carnage shows us the way forward. We must choose to be committed to building a community of safety and security in which we all have each other’s backs, allowing us to confront anti-Semitism, the vilification of immigrants and refugees, the racism with which black citizens must grapple every day, and the gun violence that threatens us everywhere we live. When the 116th Congress convenes on Jan. 3, 2019, we must demand they make gun violence prevention a top priority, by passing legislation that bans assault-style weapons and bump stocks and strengthens the background check system. We must hold leadership accountable for their words and actions, and demand that they denounce bigotry, anti-Semitism and racism in all forms. If we can do this, we will be able to reclaim the humanity and soul of our country. This is the only true answer to the carnage we have suffered. Please join us in this fight.

In a statement on the EA website, CEO Andrew Wilson shared his thoughts about the “horrific and senseless act of violence” and expressed his condolences saying, “I know many of us, myself included, are filled with shock and grief. Our teams have been working non-stop to do what we can to respond to this terrible situation.” He recognized and honored Robertson and Clayton saying that they were “respected, positive and skilled competitors.” He adds, “We are committed to supporting Taylor and Elijah’s families through this difficult time, and we send our deepest sympathies to their loved ones, to those injured yesterday, and everyone affected.” Wilson went on to breaking the news about the upcoming qualifiers. “We have made a decision to cancel our three remaining Madden Classic qualifier events while we run a comprehensive review of safety protocols for competitors and spectators,” he said. “We will work with our partners and our internal teams to establish a consistent level of security at all of our competitive gaming events.” “This is the first time we’ve had to confront something like this as an organization, and I believe the first time our gaming community has dealt with a tragedy of this nature,” he continued. “Please take time to support each other through this challenging time.” Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office Sheriff Mike Williams said law enforcement believed the shooter was David Katz, a 24-year-old gamer who had been a Madden competitor in the past; the Associated Press reported the Baltimore home of Katz’s father was raided later Sunday as part of the investigation. Read Wilson’s full statement below. To Our Players and the Gaming Community, I wanted to share some thoughts about the horrific and senseless act of violence that occurred in Jacksonville at the Madden competitive gaming event. I know many of us, myself included, are filled with shock and grief. Our teams have been working non-stop to do what we can to respond to this terrible situation. First and foremost, it is an unthinkable tragedy that Taylor Robertson and Elijah Clayton, two of our top Madden competitors, lost their lives in this way. They were respected, positive and skilled competitors, the epitome of the players and personalities at the heart of our community. Their love of competition was evident through their participation in our events over the past few years. We are committed to supporting Taylor and Elijah’s families through this difficult time, and we send our deepest sympathies to their loved ones, to those injured yesterday, and everyone affected. The event was a qualifying tournament for the Madden Classic, our first Madden EA Major competition of this season. While these qualifying events are operated independently by partners, we work with them to ensure competitive integrity and to gather feedback from players. We have made a decision to cancel our three remaining Madden Classic qualifier events while we run a comprehensive review of safety protocols for competitors and spectators. We will work with our partners and our internal teams to establish a consistent level of security at all of our competitive gaming events. We’ve all been deeply affected by what took place in Jacksonville. This is the first time we’ve had to confront something like this as an organization, and I believe the first time our gaming community has dealt with a tragedy of this nature. Please take time to support each other through this challenging time.

It’s unclear whether Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old who police say confessed to opening fire Feb. 14 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, has any connections to white supremacist groups. Florida’s Department of Children and Family Services investigated Cruz in 2016 after video on Snapchat showed the teen cutting his arms. During the investigation, Cruz’s mother told officials her son had drawn “hate signs,” including a Nazi symbol and the words “I hate N*****s,” on his backpack at some point, reported the Sun-Sentinel. Initial media reports of the massacre connected Cruz to the Florida-based white supremacist group Republic of Florida. But there later proved little evidence of such a link. Sources tell CBS News the accused gunman left 180 rounds of ammunition inside the school. Officials also say they found swastikas on the magazines for his bullets. @BojorquezCBS is hearing from one of the last people to see the suspect before the massacre https://t.co/ypTVtrXUeA pic.twitter.com/w4qgxoKbKl — CBS News (@CBSNews) February 28, 2018 The accused gunman fired 150 rounds in roughly seven minutes, killing 17 people, before trying to escape by dropping his rifle and his backpack in an attempt to blend in with other students, investigators have said. Cruz left behind 180 rounds of ammunition, which suggests the death toll could have been higher if the gunman continued shooting instead of attempting to flee, according to CNN and CBS News. A Broward County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told HuffPost the investigation was “active and ongoing,” and would not confirm reports regarding swastikas and ammunition found in the school. A representative for the Coral Springs Police Department directed questions to the sheriff’s office. Story continues This article has been updated to include comment from the sheriff’s office.

885,885,322,http://www.yahoo.com/news/shooting-suspect-twice-hospitalized-mental-illness-052752901.html,Shooting suspect was able to buy guns despite mental illness,"""BALTIMORE (AP) — The young man who opened fire at a Florida video game tournament had shown abundant signs he was struggling with a mental disorder: He was prescribed an anti-psychotic drug as an adolescent and had been hospitalized at least twice for mental illness. Yet David Katz landed at the foggy intersection of America's mental health and legal systems when it came to buying the two handguns that police say he carried during the attack, which killed two people and wounded 10 others during the """"Madden NFL 19"""" competition in Jacksonville. The rampage ended when the 24-year-old Baltimore man fatally shot himself. Experts say the gunman's history of mental illness apparently would not have stopped him from buying guns in Maryland, where buyers cannot pass a background check if they were either involuntarily committed for any period of time or voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility for at least 30 consecutive days. Court papers filed in his parent's bitter divorce do not clearly indicate whether Katz was hospitalized voluntarily or involuntarily, and the two hospitalizations described in the documents were both shorter than 30 days. In addition, Katz's hospitalizations may have occurred before the Maryland General Assembly revamped the state's firearms laws following the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. """"It appears that these disqualifications did not apply to David Katz,"""" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The Jacksonville shooting is just the latest U.S. case to illustrate the complexities of keeping dangerously unstable people from purchasing guns. A Maryland legislator said the attack highlights the need to review laws governing the length of time someone can be voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility and still pass a background check for firearms. """"That clearly is an area in need of reform,"""" said Democratic Sen. Robert Zirkin, who chairs a Senate committee that handles gun laws. Maryland lawmakers will gather in January for their annual 90-day legislative session in Annapolis, where people are still grieving the loss of five people gunned down at a newspaper office earlier this year. The gunman's attorneys are considering an insanity defense. Under federal law, people are generally prohibited from acquiring guns if they have ever been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility. Nationally, there's no federal requirement for psychiatric hospitals or courts to report involuntary commitments to the FBI for inclusion in a database used for gun-purchase background checks. Some states have their own laws. In Maryland, where Katz purchased a 9mm handgun and .45-caliber handgun, state law requires courts to report to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever people are declared mentally incompetent to stand trial or assigned a guardian because they cannot manage their affairs. In addition, Maryland law requires psychiatric facilities that admit an individual to submit a report to the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. As part of the gun-purchase application, Maryland state police require applicants' written authorization for the state health agency to disclose whether they suffer from a mental disorder, have a history of violent behavior or have been confined for more than 30 consecutive days to a mental health facility. Maryland state troopers are responsible for investigating gun purchases, but for now they are not talking to avoid interfering with the investigation in Jacksonville, spokesman Greg Shipley said. Katz's parents frequently disagreed on how to care for their troubled son, with his father at times claiming his estranged wife was exaggerating symptoms of mental illness. The couple divorced in 2007. The suspect's father, Richard Katz of Baltimore, and his mother, Elizabeth Katz of Columbia, Maryland, did not respond to phone messages from The Associated Press. Efforts to reach them and other relatives at their homes were also unsuccessful. A psychologist once warned a family court that David Katz might become violent. Katz """"could lash out and become so angry that he would hit and hurt his mother,"""" Dr. Paul Berman told the court. The divorce papers in Howard County, Maryland, say Katz started obsessively playing video games as a boy, sometimes refusing to go to school or to bathe. Elizabeth Katz, a toxicologist who worked at the Department of Agriculture, said in court papers that she would confiscate some of her son's gaming equipment after finding him playing games in the wee hours. At one point, she put his gaming controllers in her bedroom behind a locked door and he punched a hole in the door, she said. When a boy, he sometimes """"curled up into a ball,"""" refused to attend school and sobbed, she said. She asserted that her ex-husband, a NASA engineer, instructed David not to take Risperidal — an anti-psychotic medication prescribed to him. In late 2007, Katz was admitted to the Sheppard Pratt mental health system near his Maryland home for about 12 days. Court documents say a psychiatrist at that time administered antidepressants. He later spent about 13 days at Potomac Ridge, a mental health services facility in Rockville. __ Witte reported from Annapolis, Maryland.

637,637,10589,http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-guns-banks-nra-20180412-story.html,Big banks take a stand against the gun industry,"It’s too early to say for sure, but it could be that the free market will wind up doing what Congress refuses to do: tighten access to firearms and stand up to companies that make and sell assault-style weapons. Bank of America announced last week that it will no longer finance companies that make the kinds of combat-style semiautomatic rifles that have been used to such deadly effect in mass shootings. Last month, Citigroup Inc. announced that it would prohibit clients using its financial services and credit cards from selling firearms to customers who have not passed a background check, or who are younger than 21, even when neither of those things are required by law. It also now refuses to do business with clients who sell bump stocks — the device the Las Vegas sniper used to convert his semiautomatic rifles into ersatz machine guns — and high-capacity magazines. Those banking sector moves followed policy changes among some major retailers, such as Walmart and Dick’s Sporting Goods, to end sales of some guns in their stores and tighten restrictions on sales of others. There is no persuasive argument against universal background checks, yet the spineless leaders in Congress refuse to take action. The immediate genesis of all this, of course, was the Valentine’s Day slaughter of 17 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students and staff members in Parkland, Fla., the furious backlash by the survivors through social and traditional media and the ensuing nationwide March for Our Lives rallies last month that drew hundreds of thousands of protesters. The massacre and public response also have led some state and local governments to tighten controls on certain weapons and buyers. Advertisement But Congress remains stuck in the gun lobby’s “thoughts and prayers” mode, which is why it’s heartening to see some major banks and retailers taking action, whether the moves are born of a humanitarian impulse or a recognition that being too close to firearms can be bad for business or some combination of the two. Next week, students around the nation will lead another public protest — the National School Walkout to commemorate the April 20, 1999, Columbine school massacre in Colorado in which 13 people were killed. That mass shooting was, in retrospect, the beginning of the current wave of violent attacks on schools, often by students themselves, and often using semiautomatic firearms. In normal times, responsible adults would argue against kids cutting classes, but these are far from normal times. So we hope this next round of anti-gun and anti-violence protests is even more successful than the March for Our Lives, and that it increases pressure on elected officials to shake loose of the grip of the gun lobby and adopt sensible gun controls. That should begin with a renewed ban on assault-style weapons. Guns designed for, or patterned after, weapons of war have no place in civilian hands. Universal background checks — which would stop guns from changing hands without verification that the receiver is eligible to own a firearm — are clearly constitutional, and help reduce access to firearms by people even the NRA thinks ought not have them. There is no persuasive argument against universal background checks, yet the spineless leaders in Congress refuse to take action. Advertisement The best proposal Congress has come up with is the so-called “Fix NICS” bill, a good measure that would put more weight behind existing requirements that federal agencies report to the national database the names of people ineligible to own a gun, and provide money to entice more states to do the same (because of the division between federal and state responsibilities, state reporting to the federal system is voluntary). But even if it were to pass, Fix NICS would still be a baby step. Meanwhile, a bill that would require all states to recognize any other state’s concealed-carry permit has passed the House, though in the wake of the Parkland shooting it hasn’t gained traction in the Senate. This is an extreme and dangerous proposal that would undermine states’ ability to set their own restrictions on who gets to walk around armed. There must be an accounting at the ballot box for Congress’ failure to attend to act on such a critical public safety issue as gun control. In the meantime, it’s good that two banks have acted, and we hope to see more banks, retailers and others that intersect with the gun industry make similar decisions. Guns may be legal, but that doesn’t wash the blood of the slain from the hands of those who manufacture and prosper from firearms.

Michael Drejka, 47, fatally shot Markeis McGlockton in July after McGlockton shoved him to the ground during a dispute over a handicapped-accessible spot. Drejka claimed he feared for his life and said he fired in self-defense. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri previously said Florida's ""stand your ground"" laws prevented him from arresting Drejka. Drejka was ultimately charged and will make his first appearance in court Tuesday afternoon. CNN has tried contacting Drejka multiple times, but has not heard back and it was not clear whether he has an attorney. Court documents show that the July incident wasn't the first time Drejka aggressively confronted drivers over parking spots or what he perceived to be traffic infractions. In one incident, he caused a traffic accident by ""brake checking"" a car behind him, according to reports. A truck driver parked in a handicapped-accessible spot About three months ago, Richard Kelly told a Pinellas County Sheriff's Office detective he was confronted by Drejka at Circle A Food Store, the same store where he shot McGlockton. Drejka, documents said, was upset because Kelly parked in a handicapped-accessible spot. The exchange between the two became very loud and Kelly said at some point during the argument Drejka told him he was going to shoot him, documents said. Drejka then went to his car and was rummaging around the center console, but documents said Kelly drove away. Drejka, Kelly said, also threw racial slurs at him. Kelly is black and Drejka is white. Court documents said Drejka wanted to voice his complaint to Kelly's employer, AA Cut-Rate Septic Tank Service, so he spoke to the owner, John Tyler. Drejka told the business owner he was lucky he didn't blow his employee's head off, documents said. A woman drove too slow through a school zone On December 12, 2012, a woman told a Largo Police Department officer that a man driving a black Toyota truck, later identified as Drejka, pointed a gun at her and the passengers in the vehicle. The woman pointed out the truck to the officer. The officer spoke with Drejka, documents said, and he told the officer the woman was driving too slow through a school zone. Drejka denied pointing a gun at the occupants of the car, documents said, but he did have a gun in his vehicle. Drejka told the officer, according to police reports, that he honked at the people in the other car, and the people in that car made rude hand gestures at him. A teen didn't drive through a yellow light On January 10, 2012, Tyler Smith, 18, was driving with a friend when a traffic light turned yellow. Smith decided not to drive through the light and stopped his vehicle. A truck, driven by Drejka, was behind Smith. Drejka honked his horn, documents said, and yelled at Smith. Drejka held a black handgun out the driver's side window of his vehicle and motioned for Smith to walk back to his truck, documents said. Drejka then followed the teen's vehicle, passed it and slammed on his brakes, according to police reports . The teen did not press charges, documents said. When officers confronted Drejka about the incident, he said the teen's car cut him off, the police report said. He said he neither followed the teen's car nor did he show his gun, but did admit to having one in his vehicle. The 'brake-checking' incident Drejka was driving his truck down US Route 19 Alternate in Pinellas County on November 13, 2013, when a woman turned onto the route, pulling into the center lane so that Drejka could pass, according to a police report. She then pulled out behind Drejka. Drejka would later tell a state trooper that he felt the woman, who had her 4- and 7-year-old children in the car, almost hit him when she pulled into the center lane, the police report said. He began hitting his brakes ""in an aggressive manner,"" closing the distance between him and the woman, the report said. As she got closer, he again slammed his brakes aggressively and the woman rear-ended him, the report said. Drejka told police he was trying to turn into a store but missed the turn, the report said. But he also acknowledged being upset with the woman, according to the report, and said he was ""brake checking,"" a term for when you hit the brakes because another driver is riding your tail. ""Based on my training and experience and the damage to both vehicles, (Drejka) did not attempt to turn prior to the crash,"" the trooper wrote in the report, which said Drejka was cited for stopping or sudden decrease in speed without signaling.",Clearwater Shooting of Markeis McGlockton Stand-your-ground law  Pinellas County Sheriff's Office Sheriff Manslaughter Lawyer State's attorney Judge,"A memorial in Clearwater, Fla., where Markeis McGlockton was shot.","(CNN) The man charged with manslaughter after shooting another man in a Clearwater, Florida, convenience store parking lot has a history of threatening drivers, according to documents from the Pinellas County Circuit Court.

President Trump visits Pittsburgh in the wake of synagogue massacre Butler Co. Prison The man accused of massacring 11 Jews in an anti-Semitic rampage at a Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend is still relatively unknown, but appears to be the textbook fit of what law enforcement experts consider the lone mass shooter profile. Based on interviews with law enforcement officials and the few who say they knew suspect Robert Bowers, the 46-year-old man appeared to live a life of stark isolation and seeming loneliness. Bowers lived alone in the Pittsburgh area, and in the 18 months at his most recent home, neighbors said he was always by himself and never opened the blinds. McAnulty Acres, where Robert Bowers had an apartment in Pittsburgh, Oct. 28, 2018. Michael Henninger/The New York Times/Redux Bowers -- who was taken into custody Saturday and is now being held in the Butler County Prison -- never married and has no children. All neighbors, former neighbors or co-workers who spoke to ABC News described Bowers the same way: “quiet,” “kept to himself” and that “he looked very normal.” A driver from B. Keppel Trucking, where Bowers used to work, didn't recall him, but described it as the kind of job where you didn't need to interact with your coworkers. A Department of Motor Vehicles ID picture of Robert Bowers, the suspect of the attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. AFP/Getty Images Bowers fits every characteristic of the lone mass shooter, according to ABC News contributor and former FBI agent Brad Garrett. ""Typically these mass shooters tend to be ghosts in their own communities,"" Garrett said. ""Mass shooters tend to work alone, they tend to be paranoid, they tend to be somewhat delusional. They almost exclusively are completely isolated or mostly isolated from the rest of the world because they feel like they're on the outside of the world looking in."" ""They tend to spend a lot of time online with like-minded individuals or groups that have a similar philosophy that they do,"" Garrett said. Mass shooters also tend to feel ""completely and utterly powerless,"" Garrett said, and think carrying out violence will give them power -- at least for those few minutes. Law enforcement officers secure the scene where multiple people were shot, Oct. 27, 2018, at the Tree of Life Congregation in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. Alexandra Wimley/Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via AP Minutes before carrying out the carnage at the Tree of Life Synagogue Saturday, Bowers is believed to have posted his intent to commit the massacre on the social media platform Gab, which is popular with white supremacists and the alt-right, investigators said. Prosecutors say Bowers -- carrying an assault-style rifle and three handguns -- ""made statements regarding genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people"" during the 20-minute attack.

Coulter wrote on Twitter, linking to a  New York Times  article titled, """"Israel responded with rifle fire to a mass attempt by Palestinians to cross a border fence, killing at least 28, Palestinian officials said.""""  Britain, France and Germany called for the Israeli government to exercise restraint in dealing with protesters, while the White House blamed militant group Hamas for the violence. The protests broke out as the U.S. embassy was officially moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and also coincided with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s founding. Coulter, who has made a seven-figure fortune railing against progressive causes, has been one of the most public—and harshest—critics of illegal immigration. It's not the first time the conservative firebrand has proposed shooting migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally. In an interview with radio program Right Wing Watch, Coulter suggested that using gunfire would send a warning.  """"If you shoot one to encourage the others, maybe they’ll learn, but otherwise, we’ll see, we’ll see,"""" she said, noting that President Donald Trump's proposed border wall was a more preferable option. Although she was a staunch advocate for Trump during the 2016 election, Coulter has seemingly become disillusioned with the blustery business mogul—in large part due to her disappointment with the president's treatment of DACA and illegal immigration. In January, she opined that the president's meeting with Democrats on the issue was the nadir  of Trump's presidency.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now In her recent book In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!, she wrote that immigrants make the U.S. more dishonest.  'In the same way any immigrant to Finland makes it less white, any immigrant to America makes it less honest,' she opines in the book.  Conservative political commentator and author Ann Coulter discusses her """"Adios, America!

The NoRA Initiative (short for No Rifle Association) put the NRA on notice in a letter to Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre enumerating the organization’s efforts to combat tougher gun regulations following mass shootings. “We’re going to shine a bright light on what you and your organization do to America. We’re going to make sure the whole world sees your bloody hands,” the NoRA initiative wrote. “We’re coming for your money. We’re coming for your puppets.” The campaign was announced to coincide with the 19th anniversary of the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado that claimed the lives of 12 students and one teacher in one of the deadliest episodes of school violence. Milano said the coalition was conceived on Feb. 15, the day after the Parkland shootings. She began reaching out to her circle of friends, many of whom are activists, to work together to combat gun violence and the influence of the NRA. “It was a plea, ‘Can we please do something about this?” Milano said. “We’re smart people. We can figure this out.” Milano said some 50 people are working on the NoRA initiative, which is dedicated to shining a light on the NRA’s stranglehold over the government and move influence the national conversation around gun violence. “So, we chip away at this,” Milano said. “Until we can really change this narrative by hacking the gun violence culture, nothing is going to change.” The coalition’s members include several who were outspoken in the #MeToo movement confronting sexual assault and harassment in Hollywood, such as Ashley Judd and Debra Messing, and other prominent activists, artists, writers and celebrities: Alec Baldwin, W. Kamau Bell, Don Cheadle, Minnie Driver, Jimmy Kimmel, Julianne Moore, Patton Oswalt, Jason Ritter and Amy Schumer. Milano was among a handful of celebrities pressuring Amazon to drop the National Rifle Association’s online video channel NRATV from its streaming service in a campaign to mute the lobbying group’s influence.

This New Coalition of Celebrities and Activists Just Pledged to Take on the NRA https://t.co/BzEeGueZUJ #NoRA — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) April 20, 2018 NoRA pledged to work to register and mobilize voters to reject NRA-backed candidates and to raise money for organizations that share its vision for freedom from gun violence. An audit conducted by the Center for Responsive Politics reveals the size of the challenge. The NRA poured unprecedented amounts of money into efforts to deliver Donald Trump the White House and help Republicans hold on to both houses of Congress. Expenditures in 2016 totaled more than $419 million, according to OpenSecrets.org. “Today we lift the voices of the children who died because you refused to allow your puppets to vote for mandatory safe storage, trigger locks, assault-weapons-bans, or other common-sense devices and protections,” the letter to LaPierre notes. “Today we speak for the majority of Americans who correctly say your policies are bad for our nation.

The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, occurred after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun ownership laws. At the same time, gun control activists are stepping up pressure on Amazon.com Inc and other online streaming platforms to drop the online video channel NRATV, featuring gun-friendly programming produced by the NRA. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, founded after 20 first-graders were shot and killed at a Connecticut school in 2012, sent letters to Apple Inc, AT&T Inc, Amazon, Alphabet Inc's Google and Roku Inc on Friday, asking them to drop NRATV from their platforms. ""We have been just disgusted by NRATV since its beginning,"" Shannon Watts, founder of the Moms Demand Action group, told Reuters. ""It tries to pit Americans against one another, all in an attempt to further their agenda of selling guns."" AT&T said it does not carry NRATV. None of the other companies immediately responded to requests for comment. The issue of gun control, and the NRA's role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate on Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights. The group has not commented on companies cutting ties. Angry student survivors of the shooting have confronted politicians from state lawmakers to U.S. President Donald Trump himself, demanding stricter gun control laws. In response, the NRA and Trump have suggested arming teachers who have received training to deter attackers, a proposal that has been met with skepticism by teachers unions and gun violence experts. TRENDING ON TWITTER Before the corporate defections, nearly two dozen companies nationwide had offered incentives to NRA members, according to ThinkProgress.com, a news site owned by the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The attrition started late Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA's contract to issue a co-branded Visa card. By Friday, the list of defectors expanded to include Symantec Corp, which ended an discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs. Chubb Ltd said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc, also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA. David Hogg, one of the student survivors of last week's attack who launched the #NeverAgain anti-gun violence movement, said the students would target any company with ties to the NRA, in addition to lawmakers who accept donations. About a dozen other companies with marketing ties to the NRA, including FedEx Corp and Hertz, which offer discount programs, did not respond to requests for comment. SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS Activists have also called on public pension funds to divest from gun maker stocks, which were broadly lower on Friday. Meanwhile, an online campaign using the Twitter hashtag #StopNRAmazon picked up steam, putting pressure on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to drop the channel. Many of those tweeting are in the entertainment industry.

How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Cody Wilson fired the shot heard around the internet in 2013 with what is widely believed to be the first 3D-printed gun. Now the self-described ""crypto-anarchist"" is at the center of a fierce legal battle over whether Americans should be able to print guns that would be unregulated and untraceable. After Wilson in 2013 successfully fired a bullet from the world’s first 3D-printed handgun and posted its design online, the video got nearly half a million views, and the design was downloaded nearly 100,000 times. After a few days, the link was terminated by law enforcement officials. Years of litigation followed, leading to a settlement a week ago allowing Wilson to re-release the gun’s downloadable blueprints, giving anyone with access to a 3D printer the ability to create their own so-called “ghost guns” – unregulated unregistered and untraceable firearms. Eight states and the District of Columbia sued Monday to block release of the blueprints, and a federal judge in Seattle on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order against Wilson and his nonprofit firm, Defense Distributed. J.C. Cotter installs an electronic package for a Ghost Gunner milling machine at the Defense Distributed factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images But download counters on Wilson’s website suggest the blueprints were already downloaded over 20,000 times after Friday’s ruling. “The apocalypse has happened,” Wilson told ABC News on Tuesday. “You just missed it.” Opponents of his effort stressed the dangers. Guns from 3D printers would be “available to any felon, domestic abuser or terrorist,"" said Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a leader of the joint lawsuit by states against Wilson. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also emphasized the risks from easily available, homemade guns and said Congress should act. “No background check, no training, and they don’t even need to leave the house to make hundreds of guns,” Schumer said Monday, prior to the temporary restraining order on Wilson's company. “If the administration won’t act, Congress must do everything in its power to stop these websites before the damage by a mass shooter or a terrorist occurs.” A 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" is seen in a factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Wilson began experimenting with 3D-printed guns while he was at University of Texas law school, after graduating in 2010 from University of Central Arkansas with a degree in English. He printed his first gun during exam week of his second year of law school, then dropped out to further pursue the project. Wired named Wilson one of that ""15 most dangerous people in the world” in 2012 and one of that ""15 most dangerous people on the internet” in 2015. “The possibilities being introduced are huge,” Wired wrote in 2012. In 2012, when Wilson was just 24, he created Defense Distributed, a nonprofit defense technologies organization, and introduced his initiative to design and release files for 3D-printable guns. Wilson’s ambitions are about more than building guns. “Defense Distributed’s goal isn’t really personal armament,” Wilson explained in the 2013 video. “It’s more the liberation of information, It’s about living in the world where you can just download the file for the thing you want to make in this life.” Wilson said in a 2015 interview with an online radio broadcast that his idea for the project came from WikiLeaks. He was impressed by Julian Assange's controversial practice of publishing classified information and asked himself: “What is the WikiLeaks for guns?” ""What I recognized in Assange at the time was what’s called crypto-anarchy now and what the 'cypherpunks' developed,” Wilson told ABC News. “With these internet channels and cryptologic functions, we could end up creating secure channels, secret information, and provide worldwide distribution.” The plan was immediately controversial. Crowdfunding site Indiegogo kicked him off its platform. Statasys Inc. revoked his lease for one of their 3D-printing machines. Days after Wilson first posted the 3D-printed gun blueprints online, the State Department demanded Wilson remove them. Wilson filed suit, claiming a violation of his freedom of speech. He has said that opposition to his 3D guns shows shows how the government excessively exerts its power, limiting societal change and technological development. “It is obvious that the American techno-state has after religion become more fundamentalist and has after generations of global decolonization become more imperial,” Wilson wrote in the online publication Jacobite. “After the Cold War, it is far more aggressive in its global technical control and surveillance.” While his 3D-printed guns project was stalled in courts, he turned to other areas of interest. Wilson co-founded Dark Wallet, a “bitcoin wallet designed to make bitcoin use completely private,” allowing for increased confidentiality in financial transactions. Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed company, holds a 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" in his factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images “Bitcoin is a serious challenge to the sovereignty of the state and the state’s money power at a certain point,” Wilson said. That same year, Defense Distributed announced the Ghost Gunner, a milling machine that allows anyone to construct AR-15 and AR-308 metal guns. With accumulating legal fees, Wilson remains focused on the Ghost Gunner manufacturing company, now a lucrative business with 18 employees. In 2017, Wilson created Hatreon, an online crowdfunding site supporting popular alt-right voices – including white supremacists Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin -- who had been banned from the popular crowdfunding platform Patreon. Some of the money that helped fund the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was raised through Hatreon. “I felt no shame at all in helping Anglin and Spencer and these total villains,” Wilson said. “There’s just this intentional mainstream effort to gate-keep what are the boards of realistic debate, and of course that’s just not how [politics] functions.” The temporary restraining order slapped down this week will remain in effect at least until a hearing is held on Aug. 10, but in some ways, Wilson said, he has already accomplished what he set out to do. “I’ve demonstrated -- and Assange has and the bitcoin people have -- that crypto-anarchy is really what’s winning right now,” Wilson said. “The classical ideas of, control, confinement, surveillance—they don’t really apply to persistent, live networking.” Wilson’s endeavors have landed him on the radar of several gun reform organizations. “We have been following his activities for several years,” said J. Adam Skaggs, chief counsel to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Giffords Center is part of a coalition that fought unsuccessfully to prevent the court settlement on July 27. Giffords has identified other ghost gun sellers it’s concerned about, according to Skaggs. But he said Wilson stands out from the rest. Wilson said he won’t be censored and he’ll continue to engage with people whom some might consider extreme. “You’ll find good ideas in with the crazy people,” Wilson said.",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the self-described “Warreno-anarchist” who wants to release a gun from 3D-print guns online.","Meet Cody Wilson, the 'crypto-anarchist' who wants you to be able to 3D-print unregulated guns The debate over 3D-printed guns has been a legal one for years.

We use young people as collateral damage for the Second Amendment, and it’s wrong.” She added, “Shootings like Las Vegas happen in the equivalent of a musician’s office. That’s where we work. So for people to say, ‘Shut up and sing; you don’t have a right to talk about this’: Well, it affects us. This Thousand Oaks shooting happened just 15 miles from where I grew up in Ventura, California. To read that some of the survivors also survived Las Vegas, it’s incomprehensible — the trauma these people have endured.” Both massacres were direct hits on the country music fan base, which she also takes personally, as country music royalty and as someone who had her own run of major country hits in the 1980s — although she cautions that “in some ways, I’m persona non grata in country music. The Americana community has embraced me; I love country music and used to be part of the mainstream, but not anymore. So I can’t pretend to speak for country artists or that community. artists or that community.” Nonetheless, she used the good will she still enjoys among that artist and fan base as occasion to write an op-ed for the New York Times after the Las Vegas shootings last year, titled “Country Musicians, Stand Up to the N.R.A.” Asked by the Atlantic if any mainstream country artists had taken her up on that offer, she responded, “No. There’s a lot of fear. Particularly from younger artists who know the blowback they’ll get. Look at the blowback Taylor Swift got for just telling people to vote. I’ve gotten threats for speaking out. Like I said in the op-ed, people wanted to kill us because we spoke out against gun violence. There’s a level of insanity that’s taken root.” As she often is, Cash was asked to defend her father’s legacy against the idea held by a lot of pro-gun conservatives that he was one of them. “Oh, it’s so ridiculous, and I never use him to support my own agenda,” she said. “But he was on the advisory board of PAX, the anti-gun-violence-against-children organization. So, come on. He had hunting rifles and antique Remingtons, but he didn’t have an arsenal of military weapons, and he never believed in that.” Cash pointed out that she served for a decade on the board of PAX, which “was devoted to protecting children from gun violence. And I met grieving parent after grieving parent until it was crushing me. These secret pockets of the deepest suffering imaginable are scattered throughout the country, and you can go your whole life without knowing they exist. When a child is killed by random gun violence, it shatters so many lives, from the parent to the family to the extended family to the school to the city. The suffering is multigenerational.” Cash’s latest album, “She Remembers Everything,” includes a collaboration with Elvis Costello and Kris Kristofferson on “8 Gods of Harlem,” a song about a child who falls victim to gun violence.

126,126,10699,https://us.cnn.com/2018/06/27/health/guns-dementia-partner/index.html,Dementia complicates US gun ownership,"With a bullet in her gut, her voice choked with pain, Dee Hill pleaded with the 911 dispatcher for help. ""My husband accidentally shot me,"" Hill, 75, of The Dalles, Ore., groaned on the May 16, 2015, call. ""In the stomach, and he can't talk, please ..."" Less than four feet away, Hill's husband, Darrell Hill, a former local police chief and two-term county sheriff, sat in his wheelchair with a discharged Glock handgun on the table in front of him, unaware that he'd nearly killed his wife of almost 57 years. The 76-year-old lawman had been diagnosed two years earlier with a form of rapidly progressive dementia, a disease that quickly stripped him of reasoning and memory. ""He didn't understand,"" said Dee, who needed 30 pints of blood, three surgeries and seven weeks in the hospital to survive her injuries. As America copes with an epidemic of gun violence that kills 96 people each day , there has been vigorous debate about how to prevent people with mental illness from acquiring weapons. But a little-known problem is what to do about the vast cache of firearms in the homes of aging Americans with impaired or declining mental faculties. Darrell Hill, a former local police chief and sheriff in Wasco County, Oregon, was diagnosed in 2013 with a form of rapidly progressive dementia. Darrell Hill, who died in 2016, was among the estimated 9 percent of Americans 65 and older diagnosed with dementia, a group of terminal diseases marked by mental decline and personality changes. Many, like the Hills, are gun owners and supporters of Second Amendment rights. Forty-five percent of people 65 and older have guns in their household, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey But no one tracks the potentially deadly intersection of those groups. A four-month Kaiser Health News investigation has uncovered dozens of cases across the U.S. in which people with dementia used guns to kill or injure themselves or others. From news reports, court records, hospital data and public death records, KHN found 15 homicides and more than 60 suicides since 2012, although there are likely many more. The shooters often acted during bouts of confusion, paranoia, delusion or aggression -- common symptoms of dementia. They killed people closest to them -- their caretaker, wife, son or daughter. They shot at people they happened to encounter -- a mailman , a police officer, a t rain conductor . At least four men with dementia who brandished guns were fatally shot by police. In cases where charges were brought, many assailants were deemed incompetent to stand trial. Many killed themselves. Among men in the U.S., the suicide rate is highest among those 65 and older; firearms are the most common method, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention These statistics do not begin to tally incidents in which a person with dementia waves a gun at an unsuspecting neighbor or a terrified home health aide. Volunteers with Alzheimer's San Diego, a nonprofit group, became alarmed when they visited people with dementia to give caregivers a break -- and found 25 to 30 percent of those homes had guns, said Jessica Empeño, the group's vice president. ""We made a decision as an organization not to send volunteers into the homes with weapons,"" she said. At the same time, an analysis of government survey data in Washington state found that about 5 percent of respondents 65 and older reported both some cognitive decline and having firearms in their home. The assessment, conducted for KHN by a state epidemiologist , suggests that about 54,000 of the state's more than 1 million residents 65 and older say they have worsening memory and confusion -- and access to weapons. About 1.4 percent of those respondents 65 and older -- representing about 15,000 people -- reported both cognitive decline and that they stored their guns unlocked and loaded, according to data from the state's 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Washington is the only state to track those dual trends, according to the CDC. In a politically polarized nation, where gun control is a divisive topic, even raising concerns about the safety of cognitively impaired gun owners and their families is controversial. Relatives can take away car keys far easier than removing a firearm, the latter protected by the Second Amendment. Only five states have laws allowing families to petition a court to temporarily seize weapons from people who exhibit dangerous behavior. But in a country where 10,000 people a day turn 65 , the potential for harm is growing, said Dr. Emmy Betz, associate research director at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, a leading researcher on gun access and violence. Even as rates of dementia fall, the sheer number of older people is soaring , and the number of dementia cases is expected to soar as well. By 2050, the number of people with dementia who live in U.S. homes with guns could reach between roughly 8 million and 12 million, according to a May study by Betz and her colleagues. ""You can't just pretend it's not going to come up,"" Betz said. ""It's going to be an issue."" Polling conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation for this story suggests that few Americans are concerned about the potential dangers of elders and firearms. Nearly half of people queried in a nationally representative poll in June said they had relatives over 65 who have guns. Of those, more than 80 percent said they were ""not at all worried"" about a gun-related accident. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) Dee Hill had ignored her husband's demands and sold Darrell's car when it became too dangerous for him to drive. But guns were another matter. ""He was just almost obsessive about seeing his guns,"" Dee said. He worried that the weapons were dirty, that they weren't being maintained. Though she'd locked them in a vault in the carport, she relented after Darrell had asked, repeatedly, to check on the guns he'd carried every day of his nearly 50-year law enforcement career. She intended to briefly show him two of his six firearms, the Glock handgun and a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum revolver. But after he saw the weapons, Darrell accidentally knocked the empty pouch that had held the revolver to the floor. When Dee bent to pick it up, he somehow grabbed the Glock and fired. ""My concern [had been] that someone was going to get hurt,"" she said. ""I didn't in my wildest dreams think it was going to be me."" An investigation classified the incident as an assault and referred it to Wasco County District Attorney Eric Nisley, who concluded it was ""a conscious act"" to pick up the gun, but that Darrell didn't intend to harm his wife. ""I evaluated it as if a 5- or 6-year-old would pick up the gun and shoot someone,"" Nisley said. Dee was outraged at the suggestion she consider pressing charges. ""I didn't want anyone to think it was intentional. Nobody would have believed it anyway,"" she said. Dee Hill needed 30 pints of blood, three surgeries and seven weeks in the hospital. Proponents of gun ownership say guns are not to blame. The National Rifle Association declined to comment for this story. Dr. Arthur Przebinda, who represents the group Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, said researchers raising the issue want to curtail gun rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and are ""seeking ways to disarm as many people as possible."" Focusing on the potential of people with dementia shooting others is a ""bloody shirt-waving tactic that's used to stir emotions to advance support for a particular policy endpoint,"" he said. ""I'm not disputing the case that it happens. I know it can happen,"" Przebinda said. ""My question is how prevalent it is, because the data is what should be driving our policy discussion, not fear or fear-mongering. It's bad science."" Two decades of NRA-backed political pressure that quashed public health research into the effects of gun violence partly explain the lack of data, experts said. But that doesn't mean there's no problem, said Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California-Davis. ""[Critics] are arguing as if what we have is evidence of absence,"" he said. ""We have something quite different, which is absence of evidence."" Delmar and Vergie ""Verg"" Scroughams of Rexburg, Idaho, ""can't imagine living without guns."" Even some families grappling with the problem are wary about calls to limit gun access. ""I hope your intent is not to 'bash' us for our beliefs and actions with guns,"" said Vergie ""Verg"" Scroughams, 63, of Rexburg, Idaho, who showed KHN reporters how she hid a loaded gun from her husband, who developed dementia after a stroke in 2009. Verg became worried after Delmar Scroughams, 83, grew angry and erratic earlier this year, waking up in the night and threatening to hit her. It was out of character for the former contractor who previously built million-dollar Idaho vacation homes for families of politicians and celebrities. ""In 45 years of marriage, we've never had a big fight,"" she said. ""We respect each other and we don't argue. That's not my Delmar."" ""I married my best friend,"" Verg Scroughams said of her husband, Delmar. ""We have been inseparable for close to 45 years."" Six months ago, Verg took the loaded .38-caliber Ruger from a drawer near Delmar's living room recliner, removed the bullets, and tucked it under socks in a box on a high shelf in her closet. ""He'll never look there,"" she said. She doesn't want Delmar to have access to that gun ― or to his collection of six shotguns locked in the bedroom cabinet. But Verg, a real estate agent who shows homes in remote locations, doesn't want to give up the weapons she counts on for comfort and protection. She carries her own handgun in the console of her car. ""We live in Idaho. Guns have been a big part of our lives,"" said Verg, who got her first rifle at age 12 and recalls hunting trips with her two sons among her fondest memories. ""I can't imagine living without guns."" Guns Under The Pillows Federal law prohibits people who are not mentally competent to make their own decisions, including those with advanced dementia, from buying or owning firearms. But a mere diagnosis of dementia does not disqualify someone from owning a gun, said Lindsay Nichols, federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. If a gun owner were reluctant to give up his arsenal, his family would typically have to take him to court to evaluate competency. Since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February, more states are taking action to make it easier for families ― including those with a loved one with dementia ― to remove guns from the home. Eleven states have passed ""red flag"" gun laws that allow law enforcement or other state officials, and sometimes family members, to seek a court order to temporarily seize guns from people who pose a threat to themselves or others. Red flag bills have proliferated across the country since the Parkland shooting; six were passed this year and six more are pending. In Connecticut, which in 1999 enacted the nation's first red flag law, police used the measure to seize guns from five people reported to have dementia in 2017, according to a KHN records review. Last summer, an 84-year-old man with dementia alarmed his neighbors at a senior living community in Simsbury, Conn., by announcing that he had a gun and planned to shoot a bear. The man later reported that his .38-caliber Colt revolver was missing; police found it, loaded, in the console of his car. Police got a court order to seize that gun and a rifle he had in his closet. What Families Can Do When a loved one gets dementia, many families get no guidance on what to do about that person's guns. Here are legal and practical steps to stay safe. In December, police seized 26 guns from the Manchester, Conn., home of a 77-year-old man with dementia who was threatening to kill his wife. She told police that he was a danger to himself, and that his threats were ""normal baseline behavior."" In 2008, police in Manchester also seized nine firearms from a 70-year-old man with dementia who had pointed a gun at his daughter when she went to check on him because he didn't recognize her at first. The man had been sleeping with loaded guns under his pillows and hiding guns in drawers, and his daughter was worried for the safety of his home health aides. In Ohio, at one memory care clinic, 17 percent of patients diagnosed with dementia reported having a firearm in their homes, according to a 2015 Cleveland Clinic study But many families are reluctant to take away the sense of safety, independence and identity that their loved one, often the family patriarch, derives from guns. 'A Guilt I'll Never Ever Get Away From' In the Appalachian mountains of West Virginia, Malissa Helmandollar, a 46-year-old assistant in an optometrist's office, regrets not taking her father's guns away. Her dad, Larry Dillon, loved to hunt. Even after a coal-mining accident left him paralyzed from the waist down at age 21, Dillon would shoot turkey, squirrel and deer from the seat of his four-wheeler. For as long as she could remember, her father kept a gun under the cushion of his wheelchair. ""He felt he couldn't take care of us, or himself, without it,"" she said. In June 2017, when her father was 65, she began to notice strange behavior. ""He would see people crawling out of the washing machine,"" she said. He forgot how to tell time. Sometimes he would just stare at his dinner plate ""like he didn't know what to do."" Every night for weeks, Dillon grew scared that people were trying to break in and burn his house down, Helmandollar said. Dillon slept with a 9 mm semiautomatic Glock pistol at his nightstand in the double-wide trailer he shared with his wife, Sandy, in Princeton, W.Va. Helmandollar made him an appointment with a neurologist, but he never made it to the doctor. Five days before his appointment, on July 6, 2017, Helmandollar's 9-year-old daughter was sleeping over at her Mamaw and Papaw's house, as she loved to do. That evening, Helmandollar got a frantic call from her daughter. Helmandollar sped to the house with her son. She found her stepmother, Sandy, dead in an armchair with several bullet wounds. Helmandollar heard her father tell police that he saw intruders breaking in to the house, so he grabbed his Glock and started shooting in the bedroom where his wife and granddaughter were watching TV. But there had been no intruders that night. Dillon, who was deemed incompetent to stand trial for murder, was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, a disease whose early symptoms can include vivid visual hallucinations. Helmandollar said her father never understood what he had done. Before he died in April, he kept asking Helmandollar why his wife never visited him. She could never bring herself to tell him. Meanwhile, Helmandollar's daughter and 18-year-old son are in counseling for the trauma they experienced. ""It crossed my mind that maybe I should've taken the guns, and I didn't,"" Helmandollar said. ""It'll be a guilt that I'll never ever get away from."" Belated diagnoses of dementia are too common, according to Dr. Melissa Henston, a geriatric psychologist in Denver who administers cognitive exams that can confirm impairment. She said many of the patients she sees have moderate or even severe dementia before being diagnosed. ""There's denial and a false belief that a lot of cognitive problems are just normal for age,"" she said. ""These conversations that need to take place never take place until it's too late."" For Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, there are limited treatments and no cure. About one-third of people with the disease become combative during the course of their illness, according to the Alzheimer's Association. And more than 20 percent who develop dementia become violent toward their caretakers, a 2014 study showed Advocates have long warned patients and families about the potential risk of guns, said Beth Kallmyer, the Alzheimer's Association vice president of care and support. ""The reality is, there's no way to know who's at risk for becoming agitated or even violent,"" she said. 'We Need To Pay More Attention' In Minnesota, Sharon Van Leer, the 70-year-old director of diversity and inclusion at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said she never would have predicted the phone call she got from police nearly three years ago. Her father, Kenneth Bowser, a 90-year-old Army veteran and retired postal worker, had been living for many years with his oldest son, Larry, 65, in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood. At 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 12, 2015, Kenneth Bowser dialed 911. ""Who is bothering you?"" the dispatcher asked him, according to a transcript of the call. ""My oldest son, oldest son and I shot him, I shot him,"" Bowser replied. ""He's laying there dead, dead."" ""Where is the gun?"" the dispatcher asked. ""The gun is in my hand,"" Bowser said. Van Leer said she believes her father never intended to be violent: ""Daddy was never like that."" In the 911 call, Bowser appears confused. ""I'm 70 -- uh, 100 -- 91 years old,"" he said. ""I'm paralyzed on one side."" Bowser, who had not been diagnosed with dementia before the shooting, was confirmed to have Alzheimer's and deemed not competent to stand trial. Now Van Leer drives 90 minutes most Sundays to visit her 93-year-old father in a locked, state-run nursing home where he's set to spend the rest of his life. Staff wheel him out to a windowless visitation room, where Van Leer and her sister spoon-feed him nutrition shakes and give him back rubs. Van Leer said she had noticed some signs of decline before the shooting — he would leave bacon on the stove and burn it, or forget where he put his cigars. But because she did not live with him, she said, she didn't realize how far his dementia had progressed. ""We need to pay more attention, as our parents get older, to the changes,"" Van Leer said. ""They can disguise it really well."" Removing guns from the home is the best way to prevent violence, the Alzheimer's Association and other experts advise. But Dr. Diana Kerwin, director of the Texas Alzheimer's and Memory Disorders program at Texas Health, said that's not the answer for all families. ""I don't do a blanket 'guns are bad, you can't have guns in the home,' "" she said. Instead, she advocates storing guns safely -- locked up, unloaded, with the ammunition kept separate from the guns. Firearms can also be disabled or, in some cases, replaced with a decoy, although that raises the risk of them being mistaken for a real weapon in an emergency. ""We had one patient with a gun with rubber bands that he would shoot and he was fine with that,"" Kerwin said. ""He was used to shooting varmints. You try to help them maintain the lifestyle they always had."" Hair-Trigger Tempers Families walk a fine line, balancing independence with safety. Christal Collins, a 50-year-old massage therapist in South Carolina, never got along with her dad. He beat her and her mother before the couple divorced, she said. But when he nearly died from spinal meningitis in 2013, Christal agreed to take him in — along with his small arsenal. Bill Collins, a retired heavy-equipment operator and Army veteran, was so attached to his guns that he kept a .22-caliber pistol in his pocket day and night, even while he slept. On Saturdays, he'd load it with rat shot and fire the tiny pellets at snakes as he mowed the lawn. On Sunday mornings, as he watched Shepherd's Chapel sermons on TV, he'd clean the gun and reload it with Magnum bullets. Bill also kept a cabinet stocked with three handguns, three sawed-off rifles, three hunting rifles and a thousand rounds of ammo. While he had stopped hunting, he told his family he didn't want to be caught without a gun when the ""race war"" broke out. A 1971 family photo shows Christal Collins, left, with her father, Bill, and sisters Tracy and Marie. As he grew older and sicker, Bill shuffled around the house in slippers and didn't seem as physically threatening, Christal said. But his bouts of aggression and paranoia grew worse, and in November 2014, after Bill had gotten lost for two hours at a local convenience store, his doctor said he was showing signs of dementia. Christal considered sending her father to an assisted living complex, but when he found out he couldn't bring his guns or knives, he refused to go. And she swore she would never put her parents through the neglect she saw when she worked at a nursing home. So she stayed in the house with him, in a rural, swampy stretch of Conway, S.C., not far from Myrtle Beach. Christal tried to limit her father's access to guns. One day, she slipped the key to his gun cabinet off his keychain — a difficult feat, since he slept with the keychain hooked to his belt. It was ""war"" in the house for three days, she said, as he hounded her and accused her of stealing the key. He then busted the original lock with a hammer and screwdriver and installed three new padlocks. Christal Collins says her father, who struggled with paranoia, shot her fiance, Allen Holtzman, in 2015. Bill also slept with a loaded .357 Magnum under his pillow. ""There was no gun safety,"" Christal said. ""Every time I tried to talk about it, it would be a fight or an argument or a problem."" On June 14, 2015, a Sunday, her father started ""cussing and ranting and raving,"" accusing someone of stealing things from his room, she said. Bill, who was 75, raised his hand to hit Christal -- something he hadn't done in his old age -- and her fiancé, Allen Holtzman, stepped in to intervene. In a flash, Bill pulled the .22 pistol out of his pocket and fired at Holtzman's chest, knocking him down to the couch. ""Dad, you shot him!"" Christal yelled in disbelief. Then she saw him put the gun at the base of Holtzman's skull. She knocked it away just as he fired. ""Wrong damn shells!"" Bill declared in disappointment, discovering he had fired rat shot. Bill aimed the gun at Holtzman's 20-year-old daughter, and then at Christal. He had a look in his eyes ""like the lights were on but nobody was home,"" Christal recalled. She dragged Holtzman, who was bleeding from over 200 rat pellets, toward safety in their bedroom, as more pellets flew behind them. Christal Collins says that if she had to do it again, she would have removed her father's guns from the home. As Christal talked to a 911 dispatcher on the phone, she heard two bangs. The first was her father slamming the door to his room. The second was her father taking the gun and, after replacing the cartridges, shooting himself in the head. Some argue that people should have the right to end their lives on their own terms instead of suffer through the debilitating decline of dementia. But Christal said she hates that her father harmed others along the way. And the aftermath of a suicide can be horrific, she said. ""When you clean your dad's brain matter off the wall, the pillow, the carpet ..."" she said, trailing off in tears, the trauma still raw nearly three years later, as she sat with her fiancé in their double-wide trailer home. Holtzman, a 42-year-old construction worker, shrugged off his own injuries, saying the pellets just burned. But Christal said they were lucky her father forgot to change the ammo. ""Allen, you would've been dead,"" Christal said. Christal said if she had to do it again, she would have removed the guns from the home. Though, she reflected, ""I honestly don't know if we could have taken them away."" Giving Up The Guns For families grappling with such decisions, one option is to establish a ""gun trust"" that outlines how the weapons will pass to family members once a person becomes incapacitated or dies. These trusts may make it easier for people who must give up firearms in order to move into a nursing home, for instance, said David Goldman, an estate-planning lawyer in Jacksonville, Fla., who said he has drawn up over 20,000 gun trusts. But the process works best when the gun owner complies. ""They rarely want to give up their guns,"" Goldman said. Another obstacle is that gun trusts must be drawn up before dementia becomes too advanced. Ideally, families should discuss firearm access soon after a diagnosis of dementia and consider setting a ""firearm retirement date,"" akin to an advance directive for guns, Betz and colleagues advise. It's similar to discussions about taking away the car keys when driving becomes dangerous, she said. ""One of the tricky things is, for driving, there are some assessments you can do,"" Betz said. ""They're not perfect, but they're helpful. There isn't anything for firearms."" Doctors who routinely ask dementia patients about driving should also ask about guns, Wintemute said. Too often, though, they don't. ""Docs say: 'I don't know enough about the risks and benefits, I don't have the time,'"" Wintemute said. ""Only about one-third do it with any frequency."" Critics of gun restrictions like Przebinda argue that the essential difference between driving and guns is that one is a privilege and the other is a protected constitutional right. ""The two are not the same,"" he said. ""You do not have a right to conveyance. You have a right to self-defense, you have a right to protecting your home and your family that's intrinsic to you as a human being."" He balks at any formal assessment of firearm use among people with dementia, saying it could lead to ""a totalitarian system that decides when you can have rights and when you cannot."" Instead, the decision should be left to families, Przebinda said. ""People who own guns know what measures are available to them."" Even that knowledge, however, may not be enough. Dee Hill of Oregon said it was ""strictly an accident"" that her husband, the retired sheriff, shot and critically wounded her. To this day, she doesn't regret showing him the guns.

""He spent darn near 40, almost 50 years in law enforcement and a gun was always with him, and so to deprive him of not even seeing them, in my heart of hearts, I couldn't deny him."" For Verg and Delmar Scroughams of Idaho, the dilemma of keeping guns in the house remains. In a lucid moment in May, Delmar acknowledged that the weapons he's had all his life could be dangerous. ""I got a disease I don't know the name of and, eventually, anything could happen,"" he said. Such moments of awareness are becoming rare, Verg admitted. Soon, Delmar may no longer recognize her. As his condition worsens, she said, it's up to her to make sure no one is harmed. ""I would feel extremely responsible,"" she said. ""It would be my fault.""",Firearm Gun Gun ownership Rifle Weapon Revolver Handgun Gun control Right to keep and bear arms,A gun used by a man with dementia.,"With a bullet in her gut, her voice choked with pain, Dee Hill pleaded with the 911 dispatcher for help.

The two people killed in the shooting allegedly committed by David Katz, 24, inside a back room bar at a Chicago Pizza restaurant in the Jacksonville Landing mall were considered the top two Madden gamers in the world, a competitor wounded in the rampage told ABC News. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News ""The suspect clearly targeted other gamers that were in a back room at the Chicago Pizza participating in this gaming tournament,"" Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said of Katz at a news conference Monday afternoon. ""The suspect walked passed patrons who were in other parts of the business and focused his attention on the gamers."" Meanwhile, court records obtained by ABC News in Baltimore from a divorce and child custody battle between Katz's parents show that Katz was treated in 2011 for mental health issues and that his mother informed the court that her son was suffering from depression and ""affective disorders."" Records also show that David Katz was once prescribed the antidepressants Risperdal and Fluoxetine. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News Sheriff Williams said Katz was armed with two handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9mm, one with a laser scope, on Sunday, but investigators believe he only used one of the weapons in the attack. ""Video surveillance from inside the restaurant clearly shows that this is a single shooter incident and that the suspect took his own life after shooting the victims,"" Williams said. He said Katz purchased both guns legally in Baltimore within the past month. Killed in the shooting were Elijah Clayton, 22, of Woodland Hills, California, and Taylor Robertson, 28, a married father of a young boy from Giles, West Virginia. Another 12 people were wounded in the shooting and a 13th person was injured fleeing the gunfire, Williams said. Police barricade a street near Jacksonville Landing in Jacksonville, Fla.,Aug. 26, 2018. Laura Heald/AP Clayton and Robertson were among the top players of the Madden NFL football e-game, according to EA Sports, publisher of the video game. Robertson -- nicknamed ""SpotMePlzzz"" -- was the defending champion of the Madden Classic, the Super Bowl for Madden gamers, held in Las Vegas. ""These two guys were two of the best Madden players in the world the last couple of years,"" Chris McFarland, a Madden gamer who was grazed in the head during Sunday shooting, told ABC News Monday from a Jacksonville hospital. Williams said Katz's motive for the shooting remains under investigation. In a video from a February 2017 interview Katz, who went by the nickname ""Bread,"" gave to an EA Sports announcer during a Madden regional competition in Buffalo, New York, he seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder for being seeded seventh in the tournament that he ended up winning. David Katz, right, has been identified by Jacksonville police as the suspected shooter at a Madden NFL esports tournament on Sunday, Aug. 26, 2018. Two people were killed and Katz committed suicide, police said. Twitter/@buffalobills ""I don't think of myself as a seventh seed. I think I'm one of the better players,"" Katz said in the interview. Sheriff Williams said Katz's car was located in Jacksonville, and investigators found the hotel room where he was staying. He said both have been searched, but would not disclose if investigators seized any evidence pertinent to the shooting. Charles Spencer, special agent in charge of the FBI's Jacksonville office, said federal agents were also in Baltimore investigating Katz's background. ""We're tracking down where the subject was before he was here [in Jacksonville], where he stayed, who he had contact with,"" Spencer said. ""In Baltimore, our agents are working with the subject's family. His parents, both mother and father, have been fully cooperative with the FBI, so far. They have provided us access to all the records we've requested."" The court records obtained by ABC News also show that in May 2006, David Katz received psychiatric treatment at the Howard County General Hospital in Columbia, Maryland. His father, according to the records, disagreed with medicating his son because antidepressants ""may increase suicidal thoughts in young people.""

The documents also show that David Katz refused treatment. ""It was clear from the testimony of both Mr. and Mrs. Katz that David had an extremely strong negative reaction both to Mrs. Katz taking David Katz to various mental health care professionals and Mrs. Katz giving him psychiatric drugs,"" according to court records detailing a hearing in the Katz's divorce. In April 2005, Katz's mother, Elizabeth Katz, called the police because her son was refusing mental health counseling, according to the records. A lawyer for his father, Richard Katz, argued that David Katz was then ""faced with the prospect of being put in handcuffs by the police,"" according to the records.

But it must come to terms with its gun problem.,"It was just another video game tournament. Based on the live stream, players were playing Madden NFL 19, and shoutcasters were giving the typical play-by-play, while the chat on Twitch.tv carried on with conversation about the match and memes. But then, a laser point appeared on one of the player’s chests. Suddenly, 12 shots rang out. There was chaos on the live stream — screaming and running around as the game abruptly paused. A voice could be heard asking, “Oh, fuck, what’d he shoot me with?” At that moment, this tournament in Jacksonville Landing in Florida, had become the site of another mass shooting in America. By the end of the gunfire, three people, including the shooter, were killed, and at least 11 were injured. It was a horrifying end to a tournament that was supposed to be a qualifying event for a national competition sponsored by EA Sports later this year. By now, mass shootings have become almost routine in America. One seems to make the news every month or so. Since the mass shooting in Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, more than 1,800 mass shootings — defined as any shooting in which four or more people, excluding the shooter, were shot although not necessarily killed — have happened in the US. We don’t yet know why this particular shooter carried out a horrific act of gun violence. But we do know why this keeps happening in America. Guns. America has the laxest gun laws of any wealthy country in the world, and it also has by far the highest number of privately owned firearms. The easy access to guns makes it easy for anyone to escalate just about any encounter into deadly violence. This means not just more mass shootings, but gun violence in general, which the US has a lot more of than its developed peers. The US can do something about this. But to understand that, it’s crucial to grasp five key points about America’s gun problem, from how unique it is to why it might take more far-reaching solutions than anyone is proposing in mainstream politics. 1) America has a unique gun violence problem The US is unique in two key — and related — ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far higher levels of gun ownership than any other country in the world. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2016. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, “The US makes up less than 5% of the world’s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.” The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms. These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. Researchers have found this to be true not just with homicides, but also with suicides (which in recent years were around 60 percent of US gun deaths), domestic violence, and even violence against police. For example, a 2013 study, led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher, found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate. This chart, based on data from GunPolicy.org, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths (including homicides and suicides) among wealthier nations: Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high levels of gun ownership are a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. 2) The problem is guns, not mental illness Supporters of gun rights look at America’s high levels of gun violence and argue that guns are not the problem. They point to other issues, from violence in video games and movies to the supposed breakdown of the traditional family. Most recently, they’ve blamed mental health issues for mass shootings. But as far as homicides go, people with mental illnesses are more likely to be victims, not perpetrators, of violence. And Michael Stone, a psychiatrist at Columbia University who maintains a database of mass shooters, wrote in a 2015 analysis that only 52 out of the 235 killers in the database, or about 22 percent, had mental illnesses. “The mentally ill should not bear the burden of being regarded as the ‘chief’ perpetrators of mass murder,” he concluded. Other research has backed this up. More broadly, America does not have a monopoly on mental illness. That’s not to say more access to mental health care wouldn’t help; it could, for example, be effective for reducing the number of gun suicides. But mental health issues aren’t what make the US stand out in terms of gun violence. The problem that’s unique to the US, instead, is guns — and America’s abundance of them. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime: Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. ”A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” This is in many ways intuitive: People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry at an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone. 3) The research shows that gun control works The research also suggests that gun control can work. A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence — a strong indicator that restricting access to firearms can save lives. Consider Australia’s example. In 1996, a 28-year-old man armed with a semiautomatic rifle went on a rampage in Port Arthur, Australia, killing 35 people and wounding 23 more. It was the worst mass shooting in Australia’s history. Australian lawmakers responded with legislation that, among other provisions, banned certain types of firearms, such as automatic and semiautomatic rifles and shotguns. The Australian government confiscated 650,000 of these guns through a mandatory buyback program, in which it purchased firearms from gun owners. It established a registry of all guns owned in the country and required a permit for all new firearm purchases. (This is much further than bills typically proposed in the US, which almost never make a serious attempt to immediately reduce the number of guns in the country.) Australia’s firearm homicide rate dropped by about 42 percent in the seven years after the law passed, and its firearm suicide rate fell by 57 percent, according to a review of the evidence by Harvard researchers. It’s difficult to know for sure how much of the drop in homicides and suicides was caused specifically by the gun buyback program and other legal changes. Australia’s gun deaths, for one, were already declining before the law passed. But researchers David Hemenway and Mary Vriniotis argue that the gun buyback program very likely played a role: “First, the drop in firearm deaths was largest among the type of firearms most affected by the buyback. Second, firearm deaths in states with higher buyback rates per capita fell proportionately more than in states with lower buyback rates.” One study of the program, by Australian researchers, found that buying back 3,500 guns per 100,000 people correlated with up to a 50 percent drop in firearm homicides and a 74 percent drop in gun suicides. As Dylan Matthews explained for Vox, the drop in homicides wasn’t statistically significant because Australia already had a pretty low number of murders. But the drop in suicides most definitely was — and the results are striking. One other fact, noted by Hemenway and Vriniotis in 2011: “While 13 gun massacres (the killing of 4 or more people at one time) occurred in Australia in the 18 years before the [Australia gun control law], resulting in more than one hundred deaths, in the 14 following years (and up to the present), there were no gun massacres.” 4) State and local actions are not enough A common counterpoint to the evidence on gun control: If it works so well, why does Chicago have so much gun violence despite having some of the strictest gun policies in the US? White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders made this argument after the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting: “I think if you look to Chicago, where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes last year, they have the strictest gun laws in the country. That certainly hasn’t helped there.” It’s true that Chicago has fairly strict gun laws (although not the strictest). And it’s true that the city has fairly high levels of gun violence (although also not the worst in the US). This doesn’t, however, expose the failure of gun control altogether, but rather the limits of leaving gun policies to a patchwork of local and state laws. The basic problem: If a city or state passes strict gun control measures, people can simply cross a border to buy guns in a jurisdiction with laxer laws. Chicago, for example, requires a Firearm Owners Identification card, a background check, a three-day waiting period, and documentation for all firearm sales. But Indiana, across the border, doesn’t require any of this for purchases between two private individuals (including those at gun shows and those who meet through the internet), allowing even someone with a criminal record to buy a firearm without passing a background check or submitting paperwork recording the sale. So someone from Chicago can drive across the border — to Indiana or to other places with lax gun laws — and buy a gun without any of the big legal hurdles he would face at home. Then that person can resell or give guns to others in Chicago, or keep them, leaving no paper trail behind. (This is illegal trafficking under federal law, but Indiana’s lax laws and enforcement — particularly the lack of a paper trail — make it virtually impossible to catch someone until a gun is used in a crime.) The result: According to a 2014 report from the Chicago Police Department, nearly 60 percent of the guns in crime scenes that were recovered and traced between 2009 and 2013 came from outside the state. About 19 percent came from Indiana — making it the most common state of origin for guns besides Illinois. This isn’t exclusive to Chicago. A 2016 report from the New York State Office of the Attorney General found that 74 percent of guns used in crimes in New York between 2010 and 2015 came from states with lax gun laws. (The gun trafficking chain from Southern states with weak gun laws to New York is so well-known it even has a name: “the Iron Pipeline.”) And another 2016 report from the US Government Accountability Office found that most of the guns — as many as 70 percent — used in crimes in Mexico, which has strict gun laws, can be traced back to the US, which has generally weaker gun laws. That doesn’t mean the stricter gun laws in Chicago, New York, or any other jurisdiction have no effect, but it does limit how far these local and state measures can go, since the root of the problem lies in other places’ laws. The only way the pipeline could be stopped would be if all states individually strengthened their gun laws at once — or, more realistically, if the federal government passed a law that enforces stricter rules across the US. 5) America probably needs to go further than anyone wants to admit America’s attention to gun control often focuses on a few specific measures: universal background checks, restrictions on people with mental illnesses buying firearms, and an assault weapons ban, for example. It is rare that American politicians, even on the left, go much further than that. Something like Australia’s law — which amounts to a confiscation program — is never seriously considered. As Matthews previously explained, this is a big issue. The US’s gun problem is so dire that it arguably needs solutions that go way further than what we typically see in mainstream proposals — at least, if the US ever hopes to get down to European levels of gun violence. If the fundamental problem is that America has far too many guns, then policies need to cut the number of guns in circulation right now to seriously reduce the number of gun deaths. Background checks and other restrictions on who can buy a gun can’t achieve that in the short term. What America likely needs, then, is something more like Australia’s mandatory buyback program — essentially, a gun confiscation scheme — paired with a serious ban on specific firearms (including, potentially, all semiautomatic weapons). But no one in Congress is seriously proposing something that sweeping. The Manchin-Toomey bill, the only gun legislation in Congress after Sandy Hook that came close to becoming law, didn’t even establish universal background checks. Recent proposals have been even milder, taking small steps like banning bump stocks or very slightly improving the existing system for background checks. Part of the holdup is the Second Amendment. While there is reasonable scholarly debate about whether the Second Amendment actually protects all Americans’ individual right to bear arms and prohibits stricter forms of gun control, the reality is the Supreme Court and US lawmakers — backed by the powerful gun lobby, particularly the NRA — widely agree that the Second Amendment does put barriers on how far restrictions can go. That would likely rule out anything like the Australian policy response short of a court reinterpretation or a repeal of the Second Amendment, neither of which seems likely. So the US, for political, cultural, and legal reasons, seems to be unable to take the action that it really needs. None of that is to say that milder measures are useless. Connecticut’s law requiring handgun purchasers to first pass a background check and obtain a license, for example, was followed by a 40 percent drop in gun homicides and a 15 percent reduction in handgun suicides. Similar results — in the reverse — were reported in Missouri when it repealed its own permit-to-purchase law. It’s difficult to separate these changes from long-term trends (especially since gun homicides have generally been on the decline for decades now), but a review of the evidence by RAND linked milder gun control measures, including background checks, to reduced injuries and deaths — and that means these measures likely save lives. There are also some evidence-based policies that could help outside the realm of gun control, including more stringent regulations and taxes on alcohol, changes in policing, and behavioral intervention programs. But if America wants to get to the levels of gun deaths that its European peers report, it will likely need to go much, much further on guns in particular.",Jacksonville Landing Jacksonville Landing shooting Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Video Games Mass shooting Madden NFL Shooting Car Police car Police,"A shooting victim in Jacksonville, Fla., on Monday.","It was just another video game tournament.

Seventeen students and staff members were killed in a mass shooting in February at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Myers was likely in the chapel of the Tree of Life, former rabbi Chuck Diamond told Pittsburgh’s KDKA-TV, when suspected shooter Robert Bowers opened fire in the synagogue. Myers’ condition has not yet been revealed by authorities. In his blog post, Myers decried the continuing cycle of bad news in America and do-nothing politicians. “The push by the students from Parkland, Florida, to enact safer schools? Now that schools are closed for the summer, apparently school safety is not important, as shooters are finding other valuable sites,” he wrote. “Despite continuous calls for sensible gun control and mental health care, our elected leaders in Washington knew that it would fade away in time,” Myers added. “Unless there is a dramatic turnaround in the midterm elections, I fear that that the status quo will remain unchanged, and school shootings will resume.” He noted: “I shouldn’t have to include in my daily morning prayers that God should watch over my wife and daughter, both teachers, and keep them safe. Where are our leaders?” Myers characterized politicians’ typical response to violence as: “Tragic event – Thoughts and Prayers – Call to Action by our Elected Leaders – Hang Wringing – Next News Event.” President Donald Trump said Saturday that the attack on the synagogue had “little to do” with gun control. Police say Bowers, who posted viciously anti-Semitic messages on a social media site, was armed with an assault rifle and a number of handguns. Story continues Trump said the synagogue would have been better protected with an armed guard. “This is a case where if they had an armed guard inside ... they would have been able to stop them,” he said.

He was charged late Saturday on 29 criminal counts, including 11 federal hate-crime charges. Among the charges were also 11 counts of using a firearm to kill. Those charges alone carry a maximum penalty of death, though no decision has been made about the death penalty. The profile includes an array of anti-Semitic comments and conspiracy theories. The anti-Semitic rants on social media prompted authorities to designate the FBI as the lead agency to investigate the attack as a hate crime. In the post just before the shooting, the organization HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, was mentioned. The post accused the agency of bringing ""invaders in that kill our people."" It's unclear who Bowers meant when saying ""our people."" On the page appearing to belong to Bowers, he wrote about a number of conspiracy theories and his stark opposition to immigration, especially the migrant caravan that has drawn ire from the Trump administration. Bowers, though, said he did not vote for Trump. He seemed to believe the president was too soft on those of the Jewish faith and wrote that Trump was surrounded by those individuals, preventing him from keeping true to his slogan: ""Make America Great Again."" Gab, in a statement, said it was ""saddened and disgusted"" by the attack but defended its ability to protect free speech. The site backed up the shooter's profile then suspended the account. But profiles like Bowers' are common on Gab. Anti-Semitic comments, conspiracy theories and wild pro-Trump posts are the norm as the website doesn't keep as tight of rules compared to mainstream sites like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. ""Gab’s mission is very simple: to defend free expression and individual liberty online for all people. Social media often brings out the best and the worst of humanity,"" the statement said. ""Criminals and criminal behavior exist on every social media platform."" Linda Lohr, who used to live across the street from Bowers, said she was stunned when she saw the news. She said Bowers, who she knew as ""Rob,"" was living with his grandfather and she'd frequently see him outside mowing the grass. ""I would have never thought he was a hatemonger,"" she said. ""You think you know what your neighbor is like, then you find out something like this."" Lohr said it seemed to her that Bowers did not have a job. She said Bowers moved out of the home when his grandfather passed away some time ago, approximately five to seven years ago. ""I would say hello as I was in my garden and we would talk about the flowers and all the weeds,"" Lohr said. ""I'm stunned that it was someone who lived just across the street. I can't comprehend it."" Another neighbor, Philip Dodge, said he lived next door to Bowers and his grandfather. ""I honestly didn't know them that well,"" Dodge said. ""Mr. Jenkins passed away a while ago."" After his rampage, Bowers was confronted by a lone Pittsburgh officer as he attempted to leave the synagogue about 10 a.m., the FBI said. The confrontation and subsequent shootout forced Bowers to barricade himself inside the synagogue. He was taken into custody after being shot multiple times and is in fair condition at the hospital. Law enforcement officials at a news conference Saturday afternoon said Bowers was not known to authorities, making it hard to foresee the tragedy. Bob Jones, Pittsburgh bureau's FBI Special Agent in Charge, said it was the ""most horrific"" crime scene he'd seen in 22 years. He said the victims were ""brutally murdered"" and was done ""simply because of their faith."" Federal charges against Bowers are expected to be filed soon, possibly as early as Saturday evening. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the charges could lead to the death penalty. Victims have not been named, but Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the shooting occurred at the synagogue during a baby-naming ceremony.

DefCAD.com A judge has temporarily blocked a website from releasing plans to 3D print guns. The temporary restraining order was issued Tuesday afternoon, hours before the website Defense Distributed would have released the plans under a settlement with the federal government. On Wednesday, Defense Distributed planned to allow anyone to download computer-aided design files of handguns as well as semi-automatic rifles. The site also aimed to allow users to upload their own plans. Defense Distributed achieved the settlement with the US State Department after the government had previously attempted to shut the site down. Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson argued that the Second Amendment guaranteed the public a right to the information, and that his free speech rights allowed him to distribute it. Wilson told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday he couldn't comment until he read the judge's full order. Several state attorneys general have said the new accessibility of 3D-printed gun plans would present a major public safety issue. The technology allows anyone with a 3D-printer to create a gun outside of regulated gun dealerships or any sort of background check. The firearms can be made almost entirely out of plastic, which would make them undetectable by metal detectors. """"For unknown reasons, the Federal Government has put the country in a clear and present danger of the irreversible proliferation of untraceable and, if made with non-metal components, undetectable guns,"""" Washington's attorney general wrote in a court document. In a Defense Distributed video on Youtube, Wilson demonstrated the company's Ghost Gunner, a CNC milling machine that can produce firearms. Without serial numbers used by commercial manufacturers, privately-built firearms are known as """"ghost guns,"""" and they're unable to be traced by law enforcement or other agencies to a registered owner. """"The same way people don't want their phones read by a third party or email read, people want rifle privacy,"""" Wilson said in the video. """"It's become kind of culturally edgy in the gun world to have your own ghost gun."""" President Donald Trump tweeted early Tuesday that he was looking into the issue. """"Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!"""" he wrote. The NRA's Institute for Legislative Action has pointed out existing laws already require any plastic firearm to be detectable — using enough metal in its design that it will show up in screenings. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Aug. 10. A case is also ongoing on New Jersey, where the state attorney general has fought to block access to the plans by residents.

What happened? Authorities say the dispute between Alex Stephens, 46, and Brian Sebring, 44, both of Tampa, Florida, reached a crescendo when Sebring drove to Stephens' house and shot him in the thigh and buttocks. According to the victim's explanation to police, the confrontation was sparked over a political spat on social media. Even though Stephens was the shooting victim, he might have played a part in provoking the confrontation. The Tampa Police Department said in an emailed summary that ""after receiving several explicit messages and threats, the defendant responded to the victim's home to confront him."" According to the report, Sebring anticipated that things would escalate, which is why he brought along his Glock for protection. Once at Stephens' house, Sebring allegedly honked his horn and waited by his truck. When the victim came outside, he reportedly rushed at Sebring's truck, at which point the accused fired upon him. Stephens ran away and Sebring fled the scene, later turning himself in to police. He was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed firearm, posted bond of $9,500 and was released from jail. TPD Assistant Public Safety Information Coordinator Janelle McGregor clarified that the department has not fully confirmed whether politics were at play in the conflict between Stephens and Sebring, saying from the detectives' point of view, ""a guy shot another guy and we arrested him."" No evidence of an argument between the two was apparent from either of the men's public Facebook pages. What's the background? Both men attended Robinson High School in Tampa, but it's unclear how they knew each other.

It just happened in the last day and a half.” But Trump, Rubio and McConnell are dead wrong: Not forcing these conversations is, quite literally, a fatal mistake. ADVERTISEMENT Discussing gun violence has become so poisonous and polarizing that it exerts a strong impact on our everyday lives and personal relationships. Some Americans who have firearms safely stored in their home, won’t bring this topic up lest others think they are Second Amendment zealots with a basement bunker stocked for a coming ammo-pocalypse. Others don’t mention the “G-word” lest they be accused of being a “libtard.” This isn’t healthy — not confronting the reality that kids get shot when they play with unsecured firearms makes such accidents sure to happen. In more public contexts, our historical reluctance to force these conversations has made it more difficult to start them in the first place. It’s hard to have educated and informed exchanges thanks to the Dickey Amendment, a provision inserted into a 1996 federal spending bill mandating that no funds allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be used to “advocate or promote gun control” — enacting a de facto ban on gun violence research — resources the lack of which we literally “die for.” Our unwillingness to talk about guns and gun violence has even made it easy for states to make such discourse downright unlawful. Indiana state law, for example, bars public and private employers from asking employees about whether they own, use, or transport a gun, with no public safety exception. If they do, they can be slapped with a civil suit for economic damages, court costs, and even punitive damages. While this law might make gun owners more comfortable, it puts others at risk by preventing employers from adequately protecting other employees from at-risk colleagues. If Bob in marketing is suicidal, or threatens Mary down in sales, then Bob’s boss is in a really tough position, and might hesitate to ask Bob whether he has a firearm readily at hand in his car trunk in the parking lot. And that hesitation might be fatal. Such restrictions are particularly mystifying when the law affirmatively protects the right to discuss gun ownership, access, and safety — even though such conversations can be discomfiting. In Wollschlauger v. Governor of Florida, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit declared unconstitutional a Florida law that ostensibly protected “patient privacy” by prohibiting physicians from asking patients about their ownership and use of firearms. That law, the court held, violated physicians’ First Amendment rights, interfering with professional standards that require them to ask and educate about firearm ownership. Patients who were uncomfortable with such questions could refuse to answer — and such topics were certainly not the only difficult discussions to emerge in doctor-patient conversations. Our growing reluctance to talk about firearms and firearm violence doesn’t respect the Second Amendment; it turns it into a club used to bully others into silence and submission. This is the opposite of what the Second Amendment is intended to be — the constitutional provision that, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia put it in District of Columbia v. Heller, has “protected the rights of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” Using the Second Amendment as a silencer bastardizes it, undermining the civil discourse essential to democracy, creating and reinforcing a flawed narrative that fundamentally changes what people think gun ownership is about and warps popular understandings of the Second Amendment. That’s how we come to believe that “shall not infringe” means literally that no firearms regulations are permissible, equate gun safety education to gun-grabbing schemes, and misconstrue even pro-Second Amendment Supreme Court cases as unconstitutional judicial activism — all dangerous misconceptions that perpetuate and strengthen the politicization of Second Amendment issues and mass shootings. The first step in preventing gun violence — from domestic assaults with firearms to school shootings like Newtown and Parkland with high body counts — is to talk about them in meaningful ways that go beyond thoughts and prayers and Facebook posts to engagement and research. Without these resources, Second Amendment advocates and opponents won’t find common ground, and the majority of us who are caught in the middle can’t learn from these exchanges. These conversations might get messy, uncomfortable, emotional and downright infuriating, but have them we must. As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in Wollschlaeger, “[m]any are those who must endure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of freedom.” Jody L.

The divisive gun organization’s spokeswoman Dana Loesch, who was hosting her show Relentless, wasn’t happy that two female characters, Rebecca and Nia, are joining Thomas, Percy, and the gang, declaring the decision “horrible” and launching on what can only be described as a bizarre rant as an image splashed on the screen of the famous trains wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods. Loesch was especially angry that one of the female characters is from Kenya. “Thomas the Tank is now bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains. Seriously,” she snipped about the preschool show, which she dubbed “creepy.” Loesch ranted that the show doesn’t need “ethnic diversity” when it “literally has no ethnicities because they’re trains. … “I’m really, really struggling to understand how in the world there isn’t any diversity in any of this,” she said as the controversial image of the trains, in KKK hoods, on burning tracks appeared. “Oh, I see it — it was the white hoods. And the burning train tracks. OK, fine, fair point. Fair. I get it. Thomas the Tank Engine has been a blight on race relations for far too long. Clearly this is overdue. Right? Seriously? With trains?” The new train, Nia, who is from Kenya, seemed to especially bother the NRA spokesperson. (Photo: Mattel) More Mattel, owner of the Thomas the Tank Engine brand, issued a statement to the New York Times saying it had “always been a priority” for the company to promote kindness and inclusivity. “We are not associated with images that promote hate and denounce any images of our brands that are being used to convey a message not in line with the values of the company.” Many of the people who saw the segment were confused by the National Rifle Association’s need to weigh in on children’s programming when it has absolutely nothing — zero — to do with guns. It seemed unnecessarily hateful to many and was called “disturbing as hell” and “sick” on social media. Director Judd Apatow called the group “a hateful nightmare” with “dumb, vicious people” and urged people to “vote in November.” This is the NRA’s totally reasonable, super clever, and not a little bit racist response to a Nigerian train character being introduced.

But there’s less consensus on whether media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence, which is a more serious form of aggression in which the perpetrator is subject to arrest and incarceration — the sort of violence that includes using a weapon to harm or kill people. The link between media violence and mass shootings is even more tenuous. Compared with acts of aggression and violence, mass shootings are relatively rare events, which makes conducting conclusive research on them difficult. President Trump first raised the issue during a meeting on school safety with local and state officials, which took place a week after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The shooter, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, reportedly obsessively played violent video games. Trump, Feb. 22: We have to look at the Internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds, and their minds are being formed. And we have to do something about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it. And also video games. I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts. And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies, they’re so violent. Trump discussed the issue again with members of Congress on Feb. 28 during another meeting on school safety. During that discussion, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, now running for the Senate, claimed mothers have told her they’re “very concerned” that “exposure” to entertainment media has “desensitized” children to violence. Previously:Trump to meet with video game makers on whether games cause violence More:Video games are good for children, no matter what Trump says More:Facebook pulls violent virtual reality games from CPAC booth after Parkland Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley also said during the meeting: “[Y]ou see all these films about everybody being blown up. Well, just think of the impact that makes on young people.” The points Trump and members of Congress raise aren’t unfounded, but the research on the subject is complex. Scientists who study the effect of media violence have taken issue with how the popular press has portrayed their work, arguing that the nuance of their research is often left out. In a 2015 review of the scientific literature on video game violence, the American Psychological Association elaborates on this point. APA, 2015: News commentators often turn to violent video game use as a potential causal contributor to acts of mass homicide. The media point to perpetrators’ gaming habits as either a reason they have chosen to commit their crimes or as a method of training. This practice extends at least as far back as the Columbine massacre (1999). … As with most areas of science, the picture presented by this research is more complex than is usually depicted in news coverage and other information prepared for the general public. Here, we break down the facts — nuance included — on the effect of media violence on young people. Is media violence a risk factor for aggression? The 2015 report by the APA on video games is a good place to start. After systematically going through the scientific literature, the report’s authors “concluded that violent video game use has an effect on aggression.” In particular, the authors explain that this effect manifests as an increase in aggressive behaviors, thoughts and feelings and a decrease in helping others, empathy and sensitivity to aggression. Though limited, evidence also suggests that “higher amounts of exposure” to video games is linked to “higher levels of aggression,” the report said. The report emphasized that “aggression is a complex behavior” caused by multiple factors, each of which increases the likelihood that an individual will be aggressive. “Children who experience multiple risk factors are more likely to engage in aggression,” the report said. More:Kentucky governor blames violent video games, movies, not guns for school shootings More:States with the most (and least) gun violence. See where your state stacks up. The authors came to their conclusions because researchers have consistently found the effect across three different kinds of studies: cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies and laboratory experiments. “One method’s limits are offset by another method’s strengths,” the APA report explains, so only together can they be used to infer a causal relationship. Cross-sectional studies find correlations between different phenomena at one point in time. They’re relatively easy to conduct, but they can’t provide causal evidence because correlations can be spurious. For example, an increase in video game sales might correlate with a decrease in violent crime, but that doesn’t necessarily mean video games prevent violent crime. Other unknown factors might also be at play. Longitudinal panel studies collect data on the same group over time, sometimes for decades. They’re used to investigate long-term effects, such as whether playing video games as a child might correlate with aggression as an adult. These studies also measure other risk factors for aggression, such as harsh discipline from parents, with the aim of singling out the effect of media violence. For this reason, these studies provide better evidence for causality than cross-sectional studies, but they are more difficult to conduct. Laboratory experiments manipulate one phenomenon — in this case, exposure to media violence — and keep all others constant. Because of their controlled environment, experiments provide strong evidence for a causal effect. But for the same reason, laboratory studies may not accurately reflect how people act in the real world. This brings us to why debate still exists among scientists studying media violence. Some researchers have found that the experimental evidence backing the causal relationship between playing video games and aggression might not be as solid as it seems. Last July, Joseph Hilgard, an assistant professor of psychology at Illinois State University, and others published a study in the journal Psychological Bulletin that found that laboratory experiments on the topic may be subject to publication bias. This means that studies that show the effect may be more likely to be published than those that don’t, skewing the body of evidence. After Hilgard corrected for this bias, the effect of violent video games on aggressive behavior and emotions did still exist, but it was reduced, perhaps even to near zero. However, the effect on aggressive thoughts remained relatively unaffected by this publication bias. The researchers also found that cross-sectional studies weren’t subject to publication bias. They didn’t examine longitudinal studies, which have shown that youth who play more violent video games are more likely to report aggressive behavior over time. Hilgard looked at a 2010 literature review by Craig A. Anderson, the director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University, and others. Published in Psychological Bulletin, this review influenced the APA’s report. In response, Anderson took a second look at his review and found that the effect of violent video games on aggression was smaller than he originally thought, but not as small as Hilgard found. For this reason, he argued the effect was still a “societal concern.” To be clear, Hilgard is arguing that there’s more uncertainty in the field than originally thought, not that video games have no effect on aggression. He’s also not the first to find that research on video games may be suffering from publication bias. But what about movies and television? Reviews of the literature on these forms of media tend to be less recent, Kenneth A. Dodge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, told us by email. Dodge, also one of the authors of the 2015 APA study, pointed us to one 1994 review of the literature on television published in the journal Communication Research that concluded that television violence also “increases aggressiveness and antisocial behavior.” Dodge told us he’s “confident” the effect this analysis and others found “would hold again today.” Dodge also pointed us to a 2006 study that reviewed the literature on violent video games, films, television and other media together. “Most contemporary studies start with the premise that children are exposed [to violence] through so many diverse media that they start to group them together,” said Dodge. Published in JAMA Pediatrics, the review found that exposure to violent media increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior, thoughts and feelings. The review also found media decreases the likelihood of helping behavior. All of these effects were “modest,” the researchers concluded. Overall, most of the research suggests media violence is a risk factor for aggression, but some experts in the field still question whether there’s enough evidence to conclusively say there’s a link. Is violent media a risk factor for violence? There’s even less evidence to suggest media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence. “In psychological research, aggression is usually conceptualized as behavior that is intended to harm another,” while, “[v]iolence can be defined as an extreme form of physical aggression,” the 2015 APA report explains. “Thus, all violence is aggression, but not all aggression is violence.” The APA report said studies have been conducted on media violence’s relationship with “criminal violence,” but the authors “did not find enough evidence of sufficient utility to evaluate whether” there’s a solid link to violent video game use. This lack of evidence is due, in part, to the fact that there are ethical limitations to conducting experiments on violence in the laboratory, especially when it comes to children and teens, the report explains. That leaves only evidence from cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies. So what do those studies say? One longitudinal study, published in the journal Developmental Psychology in 2003, found that, out of 153 males, those who watched the most violent television as children were more likely 15 years later “to have pushed, grabbed, or shoved their spouses, to have responded to an insult by shoving a person” or to have been “to have been convicted of a crime” during the previous year. Girls who watched the most violent television were also more likely to commit similar acts as young women. These effects persisted after controlling for other risk factors for aggression, such as parental aggression and intellectual ability. A 2012 cross-sectional study that Anderson, at Iowa State, and others published in the journal Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice did find that the amount of violent video games juvenile delinquents played correlated with how many violent acts they had committed over the past year. The violent acts included gang fighting, hitting a teacher, hitting a parent, hitting other students and attacking another person. However, a 2008 review of the literature published in the journal Criminal Justice and Behavior concluded that “the effects of exposure to media violence on criminally violent behavior have not been established.” But the authors clarify: “Saying that the effect has not been established is not the same as saying that the effect does not exist.” In contrast to the APA report, Anderson and a colleague argue in a 2015 article published in American Behavioral Scientist that “research shows that media violence is a causal risk factor not only for mild forms of aggression but also for more serious forms of aggression, including violent criminal behavior.” Why did Anderson and his colleagues come to different conclusions than the APA? He told us that the APA “did not include the research literature on TV violence,” and excluded “several important studies on video game effects on violent behavior published since 2013.” In their 2015 article, Anderson and his colleague clarify that, even if there is a link, it “does not mean that violent media exposure by itself will turn a normal child or adolescent who has few or no other risk factors into a violent criminal or a school shooter.” They add, “Such extreme violence is rare, and tends to occur only when multiple risk factors converge in time, space, and within an individual.” Multiple experts we spoke with did point to one factor unique to the United States that they argue increases the risk of mass shootings and lethality of violence in general — access to guns. For example, Anderson told us by email: “There is a pretty strong consensus among violence researchers in psychology and criminology that the main reason that U.S. homicide rates are so much higher than in most Western democracies is our easy access to guns.” Dodge, at Duke, echoed Anderson’s point.”The single most obvious and probably largest difference between a country like the US that has many mass shootings and other developed countries is the easy access to guns,” he said. So while scientists disagree about how much evidence is enough to sufficiently support a causal link between media violence and real world violence, Trump and other politicians’ concerns aren’t unfounded.

But when police arrived on the scene, they shot and killed Bradford, issuing a now-retracted statement incorrectly identifying the young man as the gunman. Now, the local police department is suggesting that Bradford would be alive if he hadn’t been carrying his licensed firearm. Police in Hoover, Alabama, initially praised the “heroic” officers involved in the shooting of Bradford, who they claimed had shot an 18-year-old man following a dispute and struck a 12-year-old girl with a stray bullet. But a day later, the police department said that while it was possible Bradford was involved “in some aspect of the altercation,” he did not fire the shots that started the mall incident. As Vox’s German Lopez explains, Bradford did appear to have a gun. But he was licensed to carry a firearm, and it’s not illegal in Alabama to carry a gun in public. Witnesses have also told a lawyer representing Bradford’s family that, contrary to the official police account of the incident, Bradford never drew his weapon. But the Hoover Police Department is sticking to its story: “We can say with certainty Mr. Bradford brandished a gun during the seconds following the gunshots, which instantly heightened the sense of threat to approaching police officers responding to the chaotic scene,” the department said in a Monday morning statement. Later in the day, the department attempted to clarify these remarks, issuing a second statement saying that “the word ‘brandish’ was used because Mr. Bradford had a gun in his hand as police officers responded to the active shooter situation.” The officer involved in the shooting has not been named and has been placed on administrative leave. While the police department argues that the shooting was a tragic mistake stemming from a reasonable fear, Bradford’s family says the incident is rooted in racial profiling: that police fired immediately upon seeing a young black man with a gun, despite the fact that his gun was legal and he might have been trying to help others. According to local news reports, “Several shoppers were seen with their guns drawn” as the mall shooting unfolded. While reports have noted that the mall itself prohibited weapons, it is unclear if that ban was ever enforced. Officers “saw a black man with a gun and he made his determination that he must be a criminal,” civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family, said during a Sunday press conference. Crump says that witnesses saw Bradford trying to get people away from the initial shooting, and that he kept his gun in his waistband. The family has called for video of the shooting to be released. Bradford’s family says his death is merely the latest in a series of incidents in which a black man who was lawfully armed was killed by police. They have a point: There have been several high-profile cases of black gun owners finding themselves in danger when interacting with police. The Alabama mall shooting is the latest incident to raise questions about the rights of black gun owners The police department’s recent statements about Bradford, coupled with the fact that Bradford lawfully owned his gun, has called attention to the ways that black gun owners are often viewed with suspicion and treated as threats. The topic was most recently in the news in early November after the shooting of Jemel Roberson, a black security guard who stopped a bar shootout, only to be killed by a responding police officer. Bradford’s family argues that, much like Roberson, their loved one was also denied the ability to be seen as a “good guy with a gun.” ”The pattern in America is if there’s a good guy with a gun and he happens to be black, police don’t see him as a good guy,” Crump said over the weekend. The deaths of Bradford and Roberson are two of the latest in recent years where a black gun owner was fatally shot by police. In July 2016, after telling a Minnesota police officer that he was carrying a legal firearm when he was pulled over, Philando Castile was shot while reaching for his wallet. In July 2018, Harith Augustus, a black barber working in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood, was shot by Chicago police after an officer stopped the man and questioned him for “exhibiting characteristics of an armed person.” Video showed Augustus attempting to show an officer what appeared to be an Illinois firearm owner’s ID, before being startled by an officer attempting to grab him from behind. In other cases — like that of John Crawford, who was walking around a Walmart with an air rifle in 2014, and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old shot while holding a toy pellet gun — police officers have opened fire on black people who weren’t actually holding firearms at all. The shootings have fueled concerns among black gun owners. Despite laws protecting gun rights and ownership, black gun owners say they aren’t as free to exercise these rights. “I choose to own guns for self-defense,” Louis Dennard, director of the National African American Gun Association’s Minnesota chapter, told Vox in 2017. “But that doesn’t automatically mean I’m safer when I’m armed — especially if I am stopped by police.” “We’re being killed because we’re exercising our right in a legal, moral and ethical manner,” NAAGA vice president Douglas Jefferson told Mic shortly after Roberson’s shooting. “The right to bear arms is a right we’re supposed to have on paper, but in practice, it’s being curtailed. You do not have the right if it’s not being universally respected.” It’s an issue that dates back decades, but it’s seeing new attention as gun ownership among African Americans increases and national attention to racial disparities in police shootings remains high. The issue has led to criticisms of groups like the National Rifle Association for their reluctance to jump into discussions of police shootings involving black gun owners, and has spurred the creation of groups like the NAAGA — the National African American Gun Association — which aims to fill a gap for black gun owners whose policy needs aren’t being addressed by higher-profile advocacy groups. With Bradford’s death, it is likely that these discussions will continue. “My son always respected the police and if you would have given a command when you came around that corner, say freeze, drop your weapon, he would have complied with your order,” Emantic Bradford Sr. recently told reporters.",Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Riverchase Galleria Shooting of Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Shopping Centre Shooting Birmingham Gun Firearm Police officer Suspect,"A memorial for the shooting victims at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Ala., on Monday.","When Emantic “E.J.” Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., a 21-year-old black man, heard gunfire at Alabama’s Riverchase Galleria mall on Thanksgiving night , he tried to flee.","police in alabama initially praised a 21-year-old black man with a gun in hoover, alabama. the gunman was licensed to carry a firearm, and it’s german lopez. the department says it is sticking to its story of the incident, bradford never drew his weapon. police say the shooting was a tragic mistake stemming from a reasonable fear, bradford's family says the incident is rooted in racial profiling",1,2,6,99,8,1,1,99.0,0,99
1057,1057,90342,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/09/05/magazine/school-shootings-teachers-support-armed.html,Teaching in the Age of School Shootings,"On Jan. 23, three weeks into the spring semester, a 15-year-old sophomore named Gabe Parker brought his stepfather’s 9-millimeter Ruger handgun to Marshall County High School in Western Kentucky, opened fire on the more than 600 students who were milling about the main common area waiting for the morning bell to ring, then dropped his weapon near the auditorium and disappeared into the chaos he had created. Teachers were the first responders. Before police officers and medics arrived, they gathered sobbing, vomiting, bleeding kids into the safest rooms they could find, then locked the doors and kept vigil with them through the stunned and terrified wait. They shepherded the injured to hospitals in their own cars. And they knelt on the ground with the ones who were too wounded to move, stanching blood flow with their own hands and providing whatever comfort and assurance they could muster. For the history teacher Erin Mathis, those few minutes passed like hours. She was not in the commons during the shooting, but when the health teacher screamed that students had been shot, she and a few others found themselves running toward where the sound of bullets had been heard. Mathis, whose only medical experience consisted of candy-striping as a preteen, prayed as she ran. God, you are going to have to do this. Because I cannot. Superintendent Trent Lovett was just walking into his office, a short distance from the high school, when Principal Patricia Greer called to tell him that at least one student was down. He jumped back in his truck and raced up the access road that connected the two buildings, calling his own freshman daughter along the way to make sure she was safe. When he arrived, he saw that several students had been shot and that each of them was being attended to by at least one faculty or staff member. They had no clue where the shooter was, or if he was coming back, Lovett thought. And they didn’t know if there were other shooters — or bombs or other weapons — in the offing. Hadn’t some mass shooters rigged their targets in advance with explosives? Police and ambulance were on their way, his own daughter was safe and the students who weren’t wounded had either fled or were hiding with other educators. So Lovett did the next thing he could think to do: He grabbed an aluminum bat from an abandoned bag of sports equipment and went looking for the teenage boy with the gun. Parker had slipped into the weight room, where Rob McDonald, a gym teacher and baseball coach, was keeping watch over 75 or so other frantic students whom he had managed to shelter from the panic. Two of those students had been shot. Two others approached McDonald and, in a whisper, informed him that the shooter was among them. While his teacher’s aide went to call a school administrator, McDonald moved across the room as discreetly as possible, positioned himself right behind the boy in question and braced himself for trouble. If he moves, McDonald thought, I’ll floor him. Parker’s hands were tucked into his coat pockets. It was a winter coat, and McDonald could not tell if it contained a gun. He thought briefly about what he might do if he could reach his own gun, which was in the glove box of his car. But the truth was, he had no way of knowing if this was the right kid or not. It seemed incredible to him that a boy would shoot up the school and then hide with his own victims. He was still in doubt when police officers came to the weight room several minutes later and aimed their own weapons at the boy. Not until he heard those cops ask Parker where the gun was, and watched Parker answer calmly, without denying anything, did the truth finally sink in. Superintendent Trent Lovett, in jacket, with teachers and faculty members from Marshall County High School. Left to right: Kelly Weaver, Amy Cathey, Cory Westerfield, Rob M c Donald, Patricia Greer and Erin Mathis. Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times Lovett returned to the commons and took stock. The floor was slicked with blood and spilled beverages and littered with abandoned backpacks. Dozens of cellphones rang without pause. One staff member was tending to Preston Cope, a sophomore whose family Lovett knew well and who appeared to have been shot in the head. Cope’s phone was ringing, too, and for a split second Lovett considered ignoring it. The screen read “Dad,” and Lovett was not practiced in delivering such news. But he quickly thought better of that impulse, remembering how desperate he had been for information after one of his own children was in an ultimately fatal car accident. He answered the phone, told Cope’s father that his son was not O.K., then issued a quick string of instructions: Hurry. Be safe. Pray. By then, medics were starting to arrive, and a tortured bureaucracy was being erected around the mayhem. Lovett and Greer set up a system to field incoming calls and deployed staff members to each hospital that was receiving injured students. In all, 16 students had been shot, two of whom would die: Preston Cope on the way to the hospital, and Bailey Holt right there in the commons. Holt’s parents were looking for her at the middle school, where students were being bused and where parents were being told to go. Lovett arranged for them to be taken to the meeting room in a nearby fire station and went with two officers to meet them there. They shouldn’t have to hear it in front of everyone, he thought. This time, though, he didn’t have to say a word. When the girl’s parents turned the corner and saw only Lovett waiting for them, they knew their daughter was dead. For all the fear they inspire, school shootings of any kind are technically still quite rare. Less than 1 percent of all fatal shootings that involve children age 5 to 18 occur in school, and a significant majority of those do not involve indiscriminate rampages or mass casualties. It has been two decades since Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold ushered in the era of modern, high-profile, high-casualty shootings with their massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. According to James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, just 10 of the nation’s 135,000 or so schools have experienced a similar calamity — a school shooting with four or more victims and at least two deaths — since then. But those 10 shootings have had an outsize effect on our collective psyche, and it’s not difficult to understand why: We are left with the specter of children being gunned down en masse, in their own schools. One such event would be enough to terrify and enrage us. This year, we had three. Teachers are at the quiet center of this recurring national horror. They are victims and ad hoc emergency workers, often with close ties to both shooter and slain and with decades-long connections to the school itself. But they are also, almost by definition, anonymous public servants accustomed to placing their students’ needs above their own. And as a result, our picture of their suffering is incomplete. [Watch educators as they tell us in their own words about what it’s like to to teach in an era of school shootings.] We know that the trauma that teachers experience after a school shooting can be both severe and enduring. “Their PTSD can be as serious as what you see in soldiers,” says Robert Pynoos, co-director of the federally funded National Center for Child Traumatic Stress, which helps schools coordinate their responses to traumatic events. “But unlike soldiers, none of them signed up for this, and none of them have been trained to cope with it.” We know that teachers who were least able to protect their students in the moment tend to be especially traumatized. “For teachers, the duty to educate students is primary,” Pynoos says. “But the urge to protect those students is deeper than that.” And we know that their symptoms can include major sleep disturbance, hair-trigger startle responses and trouble regulating emotions. Marshall County High school, where a sophomore killed two of his classmates and wounded 14 others in January. Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times But we don’t know much else. Researchers have calculated the rates of PTSD for a host of other traumatic experiences, estimating that it affects up to 20 percent of combat soldiers and 40 percent of rape survivors. But we have no analogous statistics for educators who survive school shootings, nor any sense of how such an experience — not to mention its hyperpoliticized, media-frenzied aftermath — might affect their ability to teach or their long-term career trajectories. “Those are important questions that really need further study,” Pynoos says. In the meantime, teachers who survived shootings are doing what they can to fill in the blanks themselves. Paula Reed, an English teacher who once taught Dylan Klebold and who retired from Columbine this spring, says that she and her colleagues reach out to schools after every incident — “Columbine always calls,” she says — to offer support and answer whatever questions they can. The questions, she says, are always the same: How long until I feel better? Will I ever be able to teach again? When will I get my old self back? Reed tries to tell the teachers the things she wishes someone had told her, starting with the fact that it takes years — not weeks — to recover. “You’d be surprised how many people don’t get that,” she says. “Six weeks after Sandy Hook, some parents and spouses were already asking why the teachers weren’t better yet.” For years, she and a few others had these conversations through an informal network. A shooting would make headlines, and they would contact the school directly, or teachers would come to them independently, seeking perspective and guidance. This year, Reed created a private Facebook page specifically for fellow educator-survivors. It has 62 members so far. “This was my last year teaching,” Reed says. “And it was, sadly, filled with school shootings.” Four weeks after the Marshall County shooting, a former student killed three educators and 14 students and wounded 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. And three months after that, another school shooter, in Santa Fe, Tex., killed eight students and two teachers and injured 13 others. In the aftermath of those events, politicians, policymakers, health officials and entrepreneurs have proffered a litany of solutions to what is now commonly thought of as the school-shooting problem. Among other things, schools have been advised to teach teachers to use tourniquets; ramp up active-shooter drills; get rid of active-shooter drills; ban backpacks; make backpacks bulletproof; teach teachers to teach compassion. Forget compassion, teach them to use guns. Forget compassion and guns and teach them how to identify budding psychopaths before they blossom into murderers. For the teachers themselves, each demand brings its own implicit expectations and its own fresh roster of uncertainties. Should they be prepared to take a bullet for their charges? To shoot one student for the sake of protecting others? Is it their job to prevent these things from happening in the first place? Regular coursework was quasi-suspended after the Marshall County shooting, but the teachers still had lessons to impart. Jenny Darnall and Kelly Weaver, who taught English and history, respectively, wanted to make sure their students took stock of the kindness enveloping the school. Look at the banners and letters and cards pouring in from across the country, they told them. Look at the comfort quilts and comfort dogs and comfort food. See the fellowship in it. And remember: When the time comes, you will do the same for others. Cory Westerfield, a teacher of algebra and German and the girls’ track coach, was adamant that his students not live in fear forever. When the starting pistol sent one of his star athletes into a panic, right as she was preparing to do the triple jump, he coaxed her onto the field, gently but firmly. “You’re going to walk down there really, really slowly,” he said, pointing to the other side of the field. “And then walk back really, really slowly.” Living in fear was not really living, he told her. It was just existing. And he wanted them to do more than just exist. Cory Westerfield, a teacher of algebra and German and the girls’ track coach at Marshall County High School. Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times The teachers were harder on themselves, though. They, too, had meltdowns: in rushing crowds, at airports, when they were momentarily separated from their own children. They sometimes berated themselves for these reactions, aware that others around them had been through much worse. Westerfield thought of Mathis’s getting literal blood on her hands and felt ashamed of his own tears. Mathis thought of other teachers — who, after the E.M.T.s took the most severely injured away, followed the trails of blood to other students who needed help — and despaired that she had not gone with them. Kelly Weaver thought of her own children and how, at the end of the day, she could still go home and hug them. What troubled Westerfield most was that none of them had seen it coming. After two decades of teaching, he considered himself a skilled reader of teenagers. He liked to think he could tell when something was bothering one of them just by how they walked into his classroom. But with this boy — this shooter — he had detected nothing. Parker sat in Westerfield’s German class for two school years in a row. He could hold an adult conversation. He had friends. He was making decent grades. And, as far as anyone could tell, he was not being bullied. (Parker’s trial date is pending, and in the absence of a plea from his lawyer, the judge in the case has entered an automatic plea of not guilty.) If a boy like that could suddenly turn murderous, then in theory, any one of their students could do anything. Whom could they trust — how could they trust — after something like this? And if the answer was that they couldn’t, what then? Jenny Darnall decided to re-evaluate her understanding of what it meant to be a teacher in the first place. She had never been particularly compassionate with the students. The way she saw it, her job was to educate them, not give them advice they should be getting from their parents. But now, she felt as if God were telling her to step up and do more: Call parents more and tell them the hard truths she might normally expect them to discover on their own. Talk to the kids more too. Tell them that they are loved, even when they’re being terrible. Those things did not feel like part of her job. But maybe now they would have to be. The school’s culinary instructor, Amy Cathey, was uncertain about these shifting boundaries. A few students had called her seeking practical advice about how to navigate their trauma outside school — for instance, how to tell their own parents that the prospect of lighting fireworks terrified them. Cathey didn’t mind the calls, or the questions. But she wondered what would happen when she wasn’t there. She worried about the graduating seniors. And she dreaded returning to anything resembling those eight or so weeks after the shooting, when it felt as if she took care of everyone except herself. She loved her kids. But she also knew herself, and she knew she couldn’t sustain that anymore. In May, Marshall Strong signs were still everywhere; they wobbled in people’s front yards, hung from doors in floral wreaths, peeked out the back windows of cars. There were even some billboards still up along the highway. Some of the teachers had grown weary of these signs. They weren’t over what had happened, of course. But they were ready to will themselves into the next phase of recovery, whatever that might be. This was a tricky place to be, in part because not everyone reached it at the same time. Westerfield waited until the school year officially ended, and not a second longer, to take the Marshall Strong sign out of his own yard. But Mathis couldn’t bring herself to take the Marshall Strong bracelet off, and her husband was worried. They lost a pregnancy early in their marriage, and he remembered how afterward she refused to remove the hospital bracelet; doing so, he suspected, would somehow make the miscarriage real to her. He worried that the Marshall bracelet was having the same effect — facilitating a denial that would ultimately keep her from moving on. She managed to tuck the bracelet away in a drawer by summer, but even then, a part of her wanted to put it back on, as if by doing so she could unmake the entire nightmare. Amy Cathey, Marshall County High School’s culinary instructor. Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times One weekend in July, Cathey drove from Kentucky to Colorado, to meet Paula Reed in person. The women had connected on Facebook, and had been texting and emailing for weeks. If the trip sounded crazy to outside observers, it made perfect sense to Reed. Driving cross-country with a small child in tow was a great way to distract a traumatized brain. Over breakfast at a diner, the two women reviewed the map of their shared reality. The terrain was deeply familiar to Reed but still painfully new to Cathey. They took turns pointing out various landmarks and junctures — the last funeral, the first school shooting after yours — and nodding in emphatic relief. Yes, that happened to us too. Yes, we had the same problem exactly. From the inside, a mass shooting can feel distinctly unchartable. But Reed — and Pynoos, and Melissa Brymer, his colleague at the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress — say that while each school shooting is different in its particulars, several features are common to all. For example, Brymer says, it can be the secondary trauma that undoes a school’s recovery. “After a shooting, everyone wants to talk about how to find the next shooter so that this doesn’t happen again,” Brymer says. “But that’s not what the school itself needs to focus on. We’ve had suicides, car accidents, overdoses.” For a school that’s already traumatized, she says, these follow-up events can be incredibly devastating. Brymer advises schools to conduct mental-health screenings before anniversaries, to find the people who are struggling most and help them. The hierarchy of hurt can split in surprising ways. For the most part, people closest to the carnage are the most traumatized, and people farther away are less so. But any teacher might be plagued by any number of things, including what they saw and how they responded in the moment. One educator might flee the building in a panic, leaving his students behind, only to be devastated by guilt afterward. Another might behave heroically, then seethe with resentment over not getting enough recognition. Each will need counseling and support to fully recover. A common lament among educator-survivors is the way that personal boundaries shift within the school community. Abbey Clements, who taught second grade at Sandy Hook, says that after the shooting, she would take her entire class to the bathroom at the same time, so that no one would have to leave her sight. But as they drew their students close, she says, she and her colleagues distanced themselves from one another. “You’re afraid that if you start talking about your own trauma, you might trigger someone else’s,” she says. “You’re also afraid of looking weak or unstable, afraid you’ll be asked to leave or take leave if you admit how much you’re struggling.” As a result, many teachers bury their fear and anger and guilt, until it changes into something else entirely. The question of where to erect a memorial, or when to take one down, can create fierce divisions. So might similar questions about how long to allow comfort dogs on campus, or what to do with the mountain of gifts and condolences that pile up. Students may come close to blows over whether to discuss the shooting during class time. Teachers may feel close to doing the same. “It’s not all ‘Kumbaya,’ ” Clements says. “When the system is cracked by a trauma of this magnitude, a lot of stuff leaks out. It gets messy. And it can change relationships.” The job itself also changes. Reed spent the rest of her career vaguely wary of all her students. “You still love them,” she says, “and you still bond with them. But you never again feel certain that none of them would ever kill you.” Even teachers who love what they do may think about doing something else. “If your bank got robbed while you were in it, you would never go to that bank again,” Clements says. “But with this, you have to go back every single day.” And leaving is not as easy as it sounds. Relocating can cost hard-won seniority and the salary that goes with it. And separating yourself from the people you just survived a shooting with can be excruciating. “They’re the people that trigger you most,” Clements says. “But they’re also the only ones who understand what you’re going through. Because how can anyone understand this that hasn’t been through it?” A ‘‘Marshall Strong’’ sign near the high school. Graeme Mitchell for The New York Times Since the Parkland shooting, at least 14 states have introduced measures that would enable educators to carry firearms on the job. The idea itself is not new; we’ve been debating it since at least 2006, when a gunman killed five children in a one-room schoolhouse in western Pennsylvania. But as the proposed measures indicate, lawmakers seem to be considering it with renewed urgency. Teachers have largely resisted this call to arms, pointing out that it would alter the student-teacher dynamic in irrevocable ways. “My job is to educate and nurture students,” Mathis says. “How am I supposed to then also be prepared to shoot one of them?” Matthew Mayer, a professor of educational psychology at Rutgers’ Graduate School of Education, says that among experts the best solutions to school shootings are not really in dispute: basic gun control, more and better mental-health services and a robust national threat-assessment program. We also need to help educators create an atmosphere where students who hear about a potential threat feel comfortable sharing that information with adults. (Many student shooters, including Gabe Parker at Marshall County, hint about their plans to at least one other person or tell them outright. Getting those others to inform teachers is one of our best options for preventing shootings from happening in the first place.) In February, Mayer and his colleagues circulated an eight-point document titled “A Call for Action to Prevent Gun Violence in the United States of America,” which summarized these and other key actions needed to reduce the risk of school shootings. So far, 4,400 educators and public-health experts have signed it. But political will is still missing. “We keep revisiting the same conversations every five or six years without learning or changing much of anything,” Mayer says. “Armed guards and metal detectors make it look like you’re doing something. You get far fewer points for talking about school climate and mental health.” The Marshall County school district banned book bags, installed metal detectors at the high school and hired four additional resource officers (armed deputy sheriffs). But Superintendent Lovett agrees that much more is needed. “We’ve made ourselves a fairly hard target,” he says. “But truthfully, can I sit here and guarantee you that it’s never going to happen again? No, I can’t.” As summer waned and the new academic year approached, some Marshall teachers were feeling torn. Mathis found that while she was not afraid to return to work herself, she dreaded sending her own children, ages 6 and 10, back to their school. She knew that it was safe, and that they would be just fine. “I know nothing is going to happen there,” she told her colleagues. But she could not stop the next thought from coming: I thought nothing would happen here. Before the shooting, Westerfield always said he would quit or retire early if something like this happened. “I’m not dying on the job,” he would quip. But returning felt like a sacred duty. How could any teacher who might replace him possibly understand what his students had been through? For that matter, how would any other school district understand what he had been through? At the same time, though, he was weary with grief. “There’s this thing inside each of us now,” he said. “We’ve lost something that we can never get back.” For Superintendent Lovett, who graduated from Marshall some 35 years ago, it came down to the simple fact that times had changed. Back then, as many kids as not had hunting rifles in their trucks, and no one ever brought a gun into the building. But, he thought, it was the lot of educators to serve as a constant, for both their students and the wider community.

Andrew Cuomo and New York regulators, the gun rights group says in a federal lawsuit. In an amended version of a lawsuit filed in May, the Virginia-based NRA said it lost insurance coverage after the state’s enforcement actions against companies underwriting an NRA-branded insurance program called Carry Guard. It said the Cuomo administration was persuading other insurers to avoid doing business with the NRA. Without liability coverage, the NRA says, it can’t maintain its offices, operate educational programs or hold rallies and other political events. The amended complaint was filed in late July in federal court in northern New York. It names the Democratic governor along with the state Department of Financial Services and its superintendent, Maria Vullo, as defendants. Advertisement Cuomo said late Friday the state was filing a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. “New York will not be intimidated by the NRA’s frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda,” he said. The lawsuit said “back-channel communications” by the Cuomo administration “made it clear to banks and insurers that it is bad business in New York to do business with the NRA.” As a result, the suit said, multiple financial institutions have entered into consent orders that compel them to end longstanding business relationships with the NRA in New York and elsewhere. “Absent injunctive relief, defendants’ blacklisting campaign will continue to damage the NRA and its members, as well as endanger the free speech and association rights guaranteed by the constitutions of the United States and the State of New York,” the lawsuit says. “The actions of defendants are a blatant attack on the First Amendment rights of our organization,” William A. Brewer III, an attorney representing the NRA, said in a statement on Friday. Advertisement The lawsuit asks the court to have the Cuomo administration stop its practices against the NRA. In addition to various communications between Vullo and financial institutions at Cuomo’s direction, the lawsuit referenced an April 20 tweet by Cuomo: “The NRA is an extremist organization. I urge companies in New York state to revisit any ties they have to the NRA and consider their reputations, and responsibility to the public.” According to the lawsuit, “Defendants’ abuses will imminently deprive the NRA of basic bank-depository services, corporate insurance coverage, and other financial services essential to the NRA’s corporate existence and its advocacy mission.” The motion to dismiss argues that the actions by the governor and Department of Financial Services were designed to protect New Yorkers and that they don’t harm the NRA’s 1st Amendment rights or other constitutional protections, Cuomo said.",Los Angeles Big Soda   Fizzy Drinks   We Trust Lawyer Championship,A display of the gun rights group’s gun rights rally in May in New York.,"The National Rifle Assn. is suffering grave financial harm that threatens its ability to pursue its advocacy mission because of a “blacklisting” campaign by Gov.

They never envisioned those dreams ending at the hands of a gunman in her school, and now they want other parents to avoid the immeasurable sorrow they continue to experience. Sheikh was one of 10 people – eight students and two teachers – killed in the May 18 shooting at Santa Fe High School outside Houston. On Wednesday, her parents – Abdul Aziz and Farah Naz – joined six other families in a lawsuit against the parents of suspected shooter Dimitrios Pagourtzis. Sheikh, 17, was less than three weeks away from completing her exchange program and returning home to Karachi when she became one of the victims in the nation’s second-deadliest school shooting this year. “No other parent should ever have to experience this unbearable grief,” Sheikh’s parents said in a statement. “Sabika’s picture is in front of our eyes every single moment, and her voice and laughter echo in our ears. For a mother and a father, this trauma and mourning stay until their last breath.’’ The lawsuit alleges that Antonio Pagourtzis and his wife, Rose Marie Kosmetatos, were negligent in storing the weapons their son used to carry out the massacre and ignored signs that he might harm himself or others. Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who was then 17 and a junior at the school, has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault on a peace officer. He admitted to the shooting spree after being arrested. In addition to pursuing more than $1 million in damages, Aziz and Naz see the lawsuit as a way to shed light on the gun culture in the United States, their lawyer said. “They had no knowledge of that before Sabika was killed,’’ Molly Thomas-Jensen said. “It’s part of a broader conversation that the U.S. has an anomalous problem with gun violence.’’ Thomas-Jensen works as counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control advocacy group that is providing part of the legal representation for the Aziz-Naz family while highlighting the issue of safe storage of firearms. More:Dad says Santa Fe shooting suspect was bullied; school rejects claim More:School shootings and mental health: Inside the minds of mass shooters The organization has helped defend gun-storage ordinances against legal challenges by the NRA in two cities in Washington State, including Seattle. Authorities have said Dimitrios Pagourtzis used his father’s legally-owned shotgun and revolver in his shooting rampage, and also brought explosive devices that did not detonate to the school. It is not clear how the weapons were stored – Antonios Pagourtzis reportedly told Greek station Antenna TV that his son took them from his closet – but neither the elder Pagourtzis nor his wife has been charged. Texas law says guns can’t be made accessible to children under 17, with certain exceptions. However, Dimitrios Pagourtzis was already 17 at the time of the attack. Defense lawyer Ron Rodgers, who represents the elder Pagourtzis and Kosmetatos, told USA TODAY via email that his clients are heartbroken over the tragedy. “While it is perhaps natural for those looking for someone to blame for the acts of a child to point the finger at the parents, the fact is that many of the allegations concerning my clients are either inaccurate or wholly untrue,’’ Rodgers wrote. “The allegation that my clients were negligent in storing their weapons is not supported by the evidence. The claim that the guns were taken from the closet is entirely false. They were kept in a locked gun cabinet. At this point, I can only surmise that this allegation was based on inaccurate translation. There are other statements attributed to Mr. Pagourtzis in his interview with Greek media that were translated incorrectly.’’ The lawsuit charges the parents not only failed to secure the weapons, but also neglected to take action even though their son “harbored violent and hateful impulses.’’ The list of examples cited in the complaint include a fascination with the Columbine school killings of 1999 and a habit of dressing like the shooters, the keen interest in firearms Dimitrios Pagourtzis demonstrated on social media and his uploading to his Facebook page of a photo with a T-shirt bearing the words, “BORN TO KILL.’’ Eric Tirschwell, litigation director for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the signs were strong enough for Pagourtzis’ parents to at least make sure he could not access the weapons. “If you make the decision to have firearms in your home, you have a responsibility to make sure they are secure, and in particularly in a situation where you have a household member, a child or otherwise, who is exhibiting behavior that would cause any reasonable person to be alarmed,"" Tirschwell said.",Santa Fe High School shooting Sabika Sheikh Pakistan School shooting Santa Fe School  Student Shooting Student exchange program,"A memorial for Sabika Aziz Sheikh, 17, who was killed in the Santa Fe shooting.","When Sabika Aziz Sheikh’s parents sent her to the United States as an exchange student from their native Pakistan in August 2017, they saw the opportunity as a step forward in her pursuit of a career in business.

I remember the heartbreak and anger so intense that I can feel it to this day, even knowing that it was never truly mine to feel next to the unimaginable grief of such horrific and senseless loss of life. Through the collective pain and talks of action, I had the distinct thought that no civilized society would ever tolerate the mass murder of its children in their own schools and that this would be the final turning point in our commitment to ending the plague of gun violence in our nation. ADVERTISEMENT Five years later, now completing my training as a pediatrician, I spend my career caring for children and working every day to assure their health and longevity. And yet, there is only so much I can do. After too many subsequent mass shootings and no meaningful change, my patients, their families and my own family remain in danger. We hear again and again calls for reasonable gun policy reform and “mental illness” uttered in the same breath. This apparent advocacy for improving mental health care seems fair- even though it has been clearly demonstrated, in countries such as Australia and Japan, that creating sensible gun laws is the only proven way to eliminate mass shootings and decrease gun violence- why not also work to solve the mental health crisis at the same time? What those who agree to mental health reform when it is proposed as a means of preventing mass shooting do not understand is how incredibly dangerous this tactic is. While well-intentioned, allowing for these topics to be discussed together is based on a series of problematic assumptions and leads to equally problematic results. First and foremost, there is minimal correlation between treatable mental illness and violent crime. In a study of 235 mass shootings, only twenty-two percent of the perpetrators could be diagnosed as having any degree of mental illness, with no proven correlation between this diagnosis and the horrific crime committed. Furthermore, less than one percent of gun homicides overall are committed by people with serious mental illness and there does not seem to be a higher rate of mental health issues in the United States compared to other nations, where rates of gun violence and mass shootings are exceedingly lower. What is true, rather, is that grouping-suffering individuals with mental health concerns, already stigmatized by society and with poor access to care, with antisocial mass murderers only creates further stigma. Most important to note is that after years of commitment to improving “mental health” spouted by legislators after each mass shooting, there has been no real change to our health-care system or increase in access, with the majority of those with mental health issues not receiving treatment and for those actively seeking help, 1 in 5 still unable to obtain it . It is apparent, then, that the cry for mental health access is a calculated distraction to replace a proven solution with an unrelated issue. When humanists, activists and especially physicians accept the false relationship between mental health and mass shootings, they perpetuate a lie that does a disservice to both causes. We, as doctors, must lead the way in rejecting this deception and promoting meaningful change on our own terms. This is a public health crisis that extends well past the realm of the political and in which every doctor must have a voice. As physicians, we must encourage all citizens who are angry, heartbroken, afraid and caught in a cycle of never-ending grief to see past the “mental illness” ruse and demand that our media and politicians address the real causes of and solutions to horrific and preventable mass shootings.

Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr was fatally shot on Thursday night by a police officer who was responding to reports of gunfire at Hoover’s Riverchase Galleria near the city of Birmingham. Authorities said a Hoover police officer who was working as security at the shopping mall confronted an armed man running away from the scene and fatally shot him. Police initially said Bradford, who was known as EJ, fired the shots responsible for injuring an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl, but investigators have since said they believe he “likely did not fire” the shots. They said the gunman is still at large. Bradford's family has employed Benjamin Crump, who previously represented the families of shooting victims Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. In a press release, Mr Crump said Bradford was a veteran who was licensed to carry a concealed firearm. Bradford’s family said they were “completely shocked, heartbroken and devastated” by his death. “EJ was a devoted son and brother who dedicated his life to serving his country and always doing the right thing,” they said in a statement. “As we continue to grieve, rest assured that we are working with our legal team to determine exactly what happened and why this police officer killed our son.” Hoover police spokesperson Captain Gregg Rector said the police “regret” their initial media release was not “totally accurate” now new evidence has emerged. “Over the past 20 hours, the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office investigators and crime scene technicians have interviewed numerous individuals and examined several critical evidentiary items,’’ he said. “New evidence now suggests that while Mr Bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim.” Story continues More than 200 demonstrators marched past Christmas shoppers on Saturday at the shopping centre where he Bradford was killed to demand justice. The protesters, who included several of Bradford’s relatives, chanted “EJ” and “no justice, no peace”. They held a moment of silence at the area outside a shoe store where Bradford was killed. “We knew that was false,” Bradford’s stepmother, Cynthia Bradford, said when she heard police were blaming him for the shooting.

Conway appeared on Fox & Friends, blaming “anti-religiosity” for Saturday’s attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue, which killed 11 people. The senior White House counselor to President Trump also called out “late-night comedians” for perpetuating such sentiment. “The anti-religiosity in this country, that is somehow in vogue and funny to make fun of anybody of faith, to constantly be making fun of people who express religion, the late-night comedians, the unfunny people on TV shows, it’s always anti-religious,” Conway said on the Fox News morning show. She continued, “And, remember, these people were gunned down in their place of worship, as were the people in South Carolina several years ago.” Conway was referencing the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., carried out by white supremacist Dylann Roof. He was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering nine people in the 2015 incident. “And they were there because they’re people of faith, and it’s faith that needs to bring us together,” stated Conway. “This is no time to be driving God out of the public square. No time to be making fun of people.” The Pittsburgh shooting marked the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Federal prosecutors have filed hate-crime charges against Robert Bowers, a 46-year-old white man who surrendered to authorities after Saturday morning’s shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. Law enforcement officials told CNN that he had made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting and targeted Jews on social media. Although Conway failed to discuss the growing issue of anti-Semitism in the United States, she praised President Trump for using such a phrase.

The vote by the Investment Committee for the California State Teachers’ Retirement System was supported by panel member and state Treasurer John Chiang even though he had asked in October that the system take more immediate action to stop investing in the gun retailers. “If Congress and state houses are either unwilling or unable to pass sensible policies to stop our schoolyards, work sites and places of worship from becoming killing fields then let’s take the battle to where the money is,” Chiang, a candidate for governor, told the Investment Committee before the unanimous vote to adopt the engagement policy. California bans the sale of assault weapons, which are any semiautomatic, centerfire rifle or semiautomatic pistol that lacks a fixed ammunition magazine and has any of a number of parts that include a telescoping stock. The ban includes AK-47s and other military-style rifles. Advertisement The new policy was drafted in the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando, Fla., and more recently at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 students and faculty in February. CalSTRS’ move follows recent actions by several Wall Street firms, including the nation’s largest money manager, to employ their financial heft to push for stricter gun laws. BlackRock Inc., with $6.3 trillion of assets under management, plans to remove the stocks of retailers that sell firearms from some of its existing and planned investment funds. And Citigroup Inc. said it would place restrictions on firearms sales for its new retail business clients, including a requirement that they don’t sell guns to someone who hasn’t passed a background check or is under 21. Advertisement Chiang said he and legislators also will pursue a bill to force the larger California Public Employees’ Retirement System to adopt a faster action plan that would eliminate investment in gun sellers that fail to change by July 1, 2021. The policy adopted Wednesday by CalSTRS does not include deadlines for engagement to result in changes. The teachers board voted to hire two full-time employees to try to persuade companies it is invested in to stop selling assault rifles. If that doesn’t work, the retirement system officials will use their proxy voting authority to vote against all members of the company’s governing board. If those two steps fail, CalSTRS would initiate a review process under the new policy to determine whether it should divest from a company and whether that would hurt its ability to pay pension benefits. Advertisement CalSTRS’ $225-billion investment portfolio includes more than $400 million in holdings in Walmart Inc., Kroger Co. and other firms that it contends sell firearms outside California that are banned in the state, according to a staff report. However, the staff report submitted to the board said the two main companies are already making changes. Kroger has indicated it is going to “responsibly phase out sales of firearms and ammunition,” and both it and Walmart have raised the age limit for gun purchases to 21, the report said. In 2015, Walmart stopped selling guns it considered assault rifles, including weapons that accept high-capacity ammunition magazines. Advertisement On Wednesday, Walmart spokesman Casey Staheli said that decision satisfied CalSTRS’ latest demands. “We stopped selling modern sporting rifles in 2015,” he said. Walmart and Kroger took their latest actions after Dick’s Sporting Goods banned gun sales to customers under 21 at its 800 Dick’s stores and 35 Field & Stream outlets — and stopped selling assault-style weapons at Field & Stream — following the Florida high school shooting. The decision by Dick’s, one of the nation’s largest sporting goods retailers, drew praise at the time from Harry M. Keiley, chairman of the Investment Committee and a high school teacher with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. “Classrooms are meant to be sacred spaces for our children to learn and grow, where fear and violence have absolutely no place and will not be tolerated,” he said. Advertisement There isn’t uniform agreement, though, at CalSTRS that divestment works. Christopher Ailman, chief investment officer of CalSTRS, said at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills this month that divesting ends any influence an investor might have. “Divestment hasn’t made the world a better place,” he said. Also attending the conference was Vicki Fuller, chief investment officer of the New York State Common Retirement Fund — the third largest public pension plan in the nation — who had the same take. Advertisement “If we divest, we don’t have a place at the table and we don’t change behavior,” Fuller said. “We do need our companies to be thinking long term about how they are going to be able to continue to generate their earnings.” But on Wednesday, the CalSTRS panel heard emotional testimony from current and former teachers who said they have been shaken by the spread of campus gun violence. CalSTRS has an obligation to engage corporate executives to try to make changes in business practices that reduce gun violence, Keiley said. “I’m under no illusion that actions that we take today or into the future will end these horrific acts of murder at the hands of people who are mentally ill using assault weapons, whose only purpose is to kill other human beings,” Keiley said during the board hearing. Advertisement “But to sit back and say that we have done enough, that there’s nothing else we can do, I believe would be a breach of our fiduciary duty,” he added. CalSTRS has taken action before in response to gun violence. After the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the teachers’ retirement system adopted a divestment policy for companies that manufacture firearms that are banned in the state.

Two of them said he displayed a gun. A black man who drives a septic truck told Pinellas Sheriff's Detective George Moffett that he parked in the same handicapped-accessible spot three months before McGlockton's July 19 videotaped shooting, the court documents show. The man said Drejka, 48, began yelling at him and said he would shoot him. The driver said he left, but as he pulled away, Drejka shouted racial slurs. The man's boss told Detective Moffett that Drejka later called, telling him ""that he was lucky he didn't blow his employee's head off."" Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox In separate 2012 cases, drivers reported that Drejka waved a gun at them during road rage confrontations. In both cases, officers stopped Drejka and found a gun in his car, but he denied showing it to the other drivers. Michael Drejka Pinellas County Sheriff's Office On Tuesday, a Florida judge kept bond at $100,000 for Drejka, who was charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a 28-year-old McGlockton, a black man who shoved him outside a convenience store in a dispute over parking. Judge Joseph Bulone in the Pinellas County court said that if Drejka posts bail, he must surrender all of his guns to the sheriff, wear an ankle monitor and not leave the county. He said he didn't have the money to hire a private attorney, which means a public defender will be appointed. McGlockton's girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, was seated in the couple's car on July 19 with two of their children, ages 3 years and 4 months, when she said Drejka confronted her for being parked in a handicapped-accessible space. McGlockton had gone into the store with the couple's 5-year-old son, also named Markeis. ""I can tell my kids now that the police got the bad man,"" Jacobs said, following the brief bond hearing. She was one of several family members who attended. ""I'm still answering their questions about when daddy is going to wake up. And all I can tell them is, daddy is resting right now."" Video of the July incident showed McGlockton leaving the store and shoving Drejka to the ground. Seconds later, Drejka pulled a handgun and shot McGlockton as he backed away. McGlockton then ran back into the store clutching his chest. Witnesses said he collapsed in front of young Markeis, who was waiting inside. McGlockton later died at a nearby hospital. ""The charges are only one step in this journey to get justice for the unbelievable killing of Markeis McGlockton in front of his children,"" said Benjamin Crump, the family's attorney. ""They understand when you look at the history of the state of Florida and stand your ground that this doesn't equal a conviction. All of America is watching Clearwater, Florida to see if there will be equal justice for Markeis McGlockton ... If the facts were in reverse, nobody would doubt what the outcome would be."" Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri originally declined to charge Drejka, saying one day after the shooting that the man was protected by Florida's stand-your-ground law. The sheriff passed the case to prosecutors for a final decision. The McGlockton family said Monday the manslaughter charge provides them ""with a small measure of comfort in our time of profound mourning.""

17,17,10679,https://us.cnn.com/2018/02/28/opinions/raising-boys-violence-opinion-drexler/index.html,This is an unspoken culprit of school shootings,"Peggy Drexler is a research psychologist and the author of "" Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family "" and "" Raising Boys Without Men ."" She is currently at work on a book about the failings of feminism. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) As politicians and gun control advocates battle it out over the best way to respond to the recent school shooting in Parkland, Florida, shifting the blame from bump stock devices to mental illness to unarmed teachers and back again, one culprit has gone largely overlooked: how we're raising our boys. Yes, the gun that Nikolas Cruz used to kill 17 people and injure many more — an AR-15-style rifle — is not the sort of gun a 19-year-old, troubled or not, should have been able to access. Most school shootings , in fact, involved automatic or semi-automatic weapons, most of them bought legally and with a federal background check. That includes the 1999 Columbine High School massacre , the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting , and the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, in which Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster XM-15 rifle to kill 26 people in minutes. But while gun control has proven necessary, what's largely missing in the conversation post-Parkland is the dire lack of emotional support we provide to boys, particularly at the critical time of adolescence. There have been eight school shootings so far in 2018. Most of the shooters were male. This shouldn't be terribly surprising: A 2015 investigation found that since the 1999 Columbine High School massacre the ""more than 40 people ... charged with Columbine-style plots"" were almost all white male teenagers, like the Columbine shooters Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. But why is it this way? A lot of attention has been paid lately to what -- and who -- is keeping women and girls back: gender biases in education and sports, employer-supported income disparity, and more. But even as efforts are made to reject gender norms when it comes to raising girls, we're not doing the same for boys — at least not nearly as well. Sure, there's a whole wave of experts imploring parents to ""let boys cry."" But that comes with a caveat, because we still want them to grow up strong, and successful, and independent. No one wants to raise (or, let's be honest, be) a mama's boy. At NPR , Hanna Rosin summed up the conflict parents face perfectly: ""I think we care a lot less about boys crying than we used to, but more than we will admit. Or to put it another way: Boys can cry, if they do it in just the right way."" And so, boys are largely not taught to navigate their feelings and, as a result, to secretly fear them. They're taught to ""play through the pain,"" emotional and physical. The idea of how a man is ""supposed to act"" is ingrained young: Research shows that violent video games and watching too much TV can fuel aggression and antisocial behavior, while the popularity of contact sports teaches boys that bigger, stronger, faster wins. In fact, research shows that from infancy through about age 5, boys are more emotive and socially oriented than girls. A study conducted by Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital found that 6-month-old boys ""tended to cry more than girls"" and were more likely to show ""facial expressions of anger [and] to fuss."" Then we essentially socialize the vulnerability out of them. Some of the differences are chemical: Adolescent boys in particular are at risk for lowered impulse control, which makes them more likely than girls to execute a violent crime. But too many are environmental: As adolescents, boys start to become more independent and they start to isolate, and we let them. They share less with their male friends and instead rely on romantic relationships as places to show their vulnerability. But when those romantic relationships go awry — as they often do, given the age -- boys are left with bruised egos and no one to talk about it with. And that's a recipe for trouble. The concept of ""protection"" is key, and here is where the firearms come in, especially when they're so very easy to get. Even as we talk about how to reduce violence in schools, we've got a President saying he believes he'd have rushed into Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School unarmed. ""I think most of the people in this room would have done that, too,"" he said to a room of politicians. This is the model that boys follow. There's more. Boys are also more likely than girls to blame others for their problems, and to develop anger and hostility toward them as a result. A 2013 study of college students showed that while women saw stalking as pervasive and harmful, men tended to blame the victims themselves for their stalking. And research on bullying has found that boys are more likely than girls to be a bully. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook The idea that bullying and boy-on-boy violence is a rite of passage may also lead to boys not asking for help in these situations. That Nikolas Cruz — just like many mass shooters before him — was revealed to be a troubled kid who displayed enough warning signs of violence is not surprising. We see those warning signs and we overlook them again and again because we expect boys to move on. We expect them to be strong. We expect them to suck it up. And, so, mass violence is increasing, getting more frequent and deadlier.

(AP) -- The gunman who killed 12 people at a country music bar in Southern California went on social media during the attack and posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane, a law enforcement official said Friday. Also, one of the possibilities investigators are looking into is whether gunman Ian David Long believed his former girlfriend would be at the bar, the official said. Authorities have not determined a motive for Wednesday night's rampage at the Borderline Bar and Grill. The official was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The official would not give additional details on what the 28-year-old former Marine posted on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. A second law enforcement official said that when Long was inside the bar, he apparently stopped shooting and posted to Instagram, based on the time stamps of the posts. Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian also said he didn't know the content of the posts. Neither Facebook nor Instagram responded to a request for comment Friday. Long's social media accounts have been taken down. Long, a former machine gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire with a handgun during college night at the bar, then apparently killed himself as scores of police officers closed in. As investigators worked to figure out what set him off, President Donald Trump blamed mental illness, describing the gunman as ""a very sick puppy"" who had ""a lot of problems."" Investigators have not commented on whether mental illness played a role in the rampage. But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff's deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed. Story continues Several people who knew Long a decade ago as a high-schooler in the suburb of Thousand Oaks said in interviews that he made them uncomfortable, sometimes through aggressive behavior. At the White House, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on PTSD among veterans. He declined to engage on questions on whether the nation needs stricter gun control laws. The dead in the shooting rampage included sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran gunned down as he entered the bar, and Telemachus Orfanos, 27, who survived last year's massacre in Las Vegas, where a gunman in a high-rise hotel opened killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival. Authorities in Thousand Oaks described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire, authorities said. Instead, when Long shot, he killed. ""Every Marine is trained in urban warfare and indoor gun fighting,"" said Marc Bender, an instructor for emergency responders in Riverside County, California. ""Every Marine is a marksman."" Julie Hanson, who lives next door to the Longs' ranch-style home, described him as ""odd"" and ""disrespectful"" well before he left home a decade ago, got married and enlisted in the Marines. She could often hear him yelling and cursing, but several months ago, unusually loud banging and shouting prompted her husband to call authorities. ""I was concerned because I knew he had been in the military,"" Tom Hanson said. About 18 months ago, Don and Effie MacLeod heard ""an awful argument"" and what he believes was a gunshot from the Longs' property. Don MacLeod said he did not call police but avoided speaking with Ian Long. ""I told my wife, 'Just be polite to him. If he talks, just acknowledge him, don't go into conversation with him,' "" Don MacLeod said. Long made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens. Dominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative. In one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his. ""I literally feared for myself around him,"" Colell said in an interview. ""He was the only athlete that I was scared of."" Colell said she wanted to kick Long off the team but the boy's coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines. She relented when, at the next track meet, Long apologized in front of several coaches and administrators. Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at Newbury Park High School and its school district were unsuccessful. Both were closed because of a destructive wildfire in the area. ___ Balsamo reported from Washington.

Unified on school safety,"The Thursday morning shooting at Salvador Castro Middle School in Westlake brings clashing concerns about weapons on campus face to face. On one side are civil rights advocates, as well as some parents and charter school operators, who decry the Los Angeles Unified School District’s policy of randomly searching students every day at every middle and high school, using metal detecting wands. It’s humiliating and interrupts school time, they justifiably contend. On the other side are district officials and parents who say, with equal justification, that any embarrassment is minor compared with the safety issue of keeping deadly weapons off campus. Some will look at the most recently shooting, which critically injured a 15-year-old boy, as evidence that the searches are needed. Others will see an ineffective policy that didn’t prevent a gun injury on campus. The shame of the matter is that no one really knows because, despite years of challenges to the random searches (known as “wanding”), the district still hasn’t taken a comprehensive look at whether its policy is effective. Nor has it examined whether other forms of violence protection might be just as effective without the intrusiveness that fosters a culture of mistrust between students and school staff. Advertisement During the 2014-15 school year, searches yielded more than 800 weapons, most of them knives and blades. Fifteen were firearms. But in addition to finding contraband, district officials insist, the random searches serve as a deterrent and that the numbers of weapons being carried on campus would be much higher without it. Maybe that’s true. Maybe not. The problem is that, more than a year and a half after this page called on the district to gather the necessary facts, it still hasn’t gotten to the bottom of the issue. Despite years of challenges to the random searches (or ‘wanding’), the district still hasn’t taken a comprehensive look at whether its policy is effective. What it has done is an audit that found the search policy was followed erratically, lending credence to critics who describe the searches as uneven and unfair, targeting some students over others. Despite the district’s rules, some schools don’t conduct searches every day. Some don’t have enough wands to get the job done. And this was an audit of only 20 schools; who knows what’s going on at scores more? Advertisement Late last year, acting Supt. Vivian Ekchian said she would commission a survey of attitudes about the searches. But this is about much more than attitudes; the key issue isn’t how people feel about weapons searches, but whether they are necessary to keep students safe. The district could run its own experiment with different security measures at various campuses, including safe passage programs to help students get safely to and from school. Opponents of the searches have contended that providing transportation would do more to ensure student safety than any number of metal-detecting wands. School leaders also could look outside the district for answers: The National Center for Education Statistics reports that random weapons searches have lost favor at many schools. In 2000, 7% of schools around the country conducted the searches; by 2014, that had dropped to 4%. What has happened at the schools that stopped? Are they just as safe? Perhaps even safer? What methods are they using? Or, perhaps, weapons have become problematic at those schools, indicating that searches are justified. L.A. Unified began the random searches after two 1993 shooting incidents in which students were killed on campus. That’s an understandable reaction. But crime rates have fallen dramatically in the decades since then, and the policy needs a thorough examination. Advertisement The district has an unfortunate tendency to institute programs without the necessary follow-up to ensure that they actually work. Issues dangle instead of being resolved. That’s what happened when the district took notice of its problems with chronic truancy. It started a few attendance pilots at various schools but never looked into which ones should be expanded and which ones had little effect. Ultimately, an outside panel delved into the issue and came up with a plan that the district recently embraced. Safety on campus is an even more important matter. We’d rather do without the searches if possible; students should be treated like eager learners, not suspects. But it would be even worse for students to feel — and be — in danger. District officials need to get beyond the debate and get the evidence on how to protect students properly. Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionand Facebook",Salvador B.

Nunley wrote in his 15-page decision, KOVR-TV reported. The decision came as good news for the firearms dealers who filed the lawsuit after they were cited for violating the 1923 law. The law was originally passed in hopes of curbing suicides and other violent acts. Rob Adams, the owner of Sacramento Black Rifle Shop, told KOVR that he had been unaware that his logo, which had a handgun embedded into the ""r"", was in violation of the law. ""It’s just an archaic law that nobody knew was on the books,” Adams said. After four years of litigation, the statute was struck down as unconstitutional on Tuesday. “Previous to today, we weren’t allowed to use any type of literature pictures or anything outside within the public’s view,” Adams said. What's the story? It all started when Sacramento Black Rifle Shop, Tracy Rifle and Pistol, along with other licensed gun dealers filed a lawsuit against the state, according to the Sacramento Bee. The lawsuit claimed the sellers had been stopped from using “truthful, non-misleading material advertising the sale of handguns at their places of business” by California Penal Code section 26820. For example, Tracy Rifle and Pistol was cited by the state's Department of Justice Bureau of Firearms for violating the 1923 law in September 2014. The dealer had four large decals on its storefront's windows. Of those, three depicted handguns and the fourth showed a rifle, all of which could be lawfully bought inside the store. What did the lawyers say? Brad Benbrook, one of the lawyers representing the firearms dealers, said he was pleased with the ruling. “This is an important victory for our clients and for the First Amendment. Judge Nunley decided that the State could not justify its censorship of our clients, and we are delighted with the opinion,"" Benbrook said in a statement to the Bee. “As the court explained today, the government cannot censor commercial speech in a paternalistic effort to keep citizens from making unpopular choices — or choices the government doesn’t approve — if they are told the truth.” What did the state say? State Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office told the newspaper that it was reviewing Nunley's ruling.

A superior court judge signed an extreme risk protection order Thursday saying Jack Sawyer, 18, poses an extreme risk of physical harm to himself and others. Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he changed his stance on gun restrictions after reading the police affidavit in the Sawyer case. He signed bills Wednesday that raise the age to buy firearms, ban high-capacity magazines and make it easier to take guns from people who pose a threat. Within 24 hours, the NRA released a video attacking the governor, saying he ""gave a one finger salute to the Constitution and to gun owners,"" reported CBS affiliate WCAX. Prosecutors say Sawyer, who kept a diary called ""Journal of an Active Shooter,"" made detailed plans for a shooting at Fair Haven Union High School in which his goal was to kill more people than in any other school shooting. Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he changed his stance on gun restrictions after reading the affidavit in the Sawyer case. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Now some residents are on edge and a school is boosting security after the state Supreme Court ruled that Sawyer should be granted bail. The court ruled Wednesday that Sawyer did not act on his plan and prosecutors did not have enough evidence to justify holding him without bail. He has pleaded not guilty to attempted aggravated murder and other charges and is being held without bail. No bail hearing has been scheduled. ""People are frustrated, they are nervous, they're scared,"" said Fair Haven cafe owner Mark Gutel said. ""Because that's a serious crime, it was a serious threat - a credible threat.""

173,173,90409,https://www.yahoo.com/news/las-vegas-shooting-survivors-embrace-life-despite-challenges-060933904.html,"1 year after Vegas shooting, survivors describe 'new normal'","LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Las Vegas massacre claimed 58 lives, making it the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Hundreds more were shot, many of them surviving after a mad dash through a sea of chaos, flying bullets and bodies. Others had to be carried out and would be dead themselves had it not been for everyday heroes who risked their own lives to save someone else's. As the one-year mark of the senseless slaughter approaches, survivors and the families of those killed are working to make sense of their new realities and their newfound hopes and fears. Here are some of their stories: NOT PRESSING PAUSE Jason McMillan has spent a month in a hospital, more than a month in a rehabilitation facility and countless hours in physical therapy trying to regain the use of his legs while coping with stares from passers-by. The 36-year-old Southern California sheriff's deputy was shot at the Route 91 Harvest Festival while trying to shield his girlfriend from the gunfire raining from a nearby high-rise. He suffered liver and lung wounds and has a bullet in his spine. Seemingly simple things can be onerous, like finding a parking spot and a table with enough space for a wheelchair so they can go out to dinner. But McMillan hasn't let these hurdles stop him from living. Since the shooting, the father of two got engaged to his girlfriend, bought a home, got a puppy, traveled to Hawaii and learned to scuba dive off the California coast through a program for wounded veterans and law enforcement. ""I'm not going to push the pause button,"" McMillan said. ""It could have been so much worse — I could even be dead, or I could be completely paralyzed from my neck down. It could be a lot worse, and that's what I tell myself all the time."" McMillan was working as a deputy at the Riverside County courthouse last year when his girlfriend, Fiorella Gaete, now 23, got tickets to attend the festival. Fans of singer Jason Aldean, they made their way toward the front of the packed crowd as he took the stage. Story continues When the popping sounds started, McMillan thought it was gunfire but couldn't tell where it was coming from in the chaos. Seconds later, the speakers shut off and concertgoers began falling to the ground. He made sure Gaete was tucked behind him, and then he was hit, and his body crumpled. He couldn't feel his legs. Blood poured from his chest. Gaete dragged him to a fence, where others helped lift him to the other side. She jumped over and pulled him by the legs until he was loaded into the back of a pickup truck, which roared toward a hospital. McMillan's days then passed in a drug-infused blur. He remembers seeing shadows on the other side of the hospital room curtain that reminded him of a silhouette with a gun. When he looked at the floor, he pictured dead bodies. He had feeling in his toes — a sign that he could recover. But if, or when, no one could say. After more than two months in the hospital and rehabilitation, he returned to California. Gaete, who broke her arm, is getting used to being his caretaker and leaving her job while coping with her own memories of that night. Some days have been difficult. McMillan's can still get down on the floor and play with his two young daughters, but sometimes he's in too much pain. ""My younger one has told me, 'I liked it better, Daddy, when you were walking,'"" he said from his home in Menifee, California. ""It hurts a little bit just having them have to experience it. It's not something I wanted for them, but maybe it will make them stronger people."" McMillan said he's long been a homebody, but that's changed a bit, too. He recently took a trip to Hawaii and learned how to scuba dive. Gaete is now trying to persuade him to go skydiving with her, and he's thinking about it. ""Now, when an opportunity comes up, I'll jump on it, whatever it is,"" he said. ""I just want to get out and experience life more."" Less than half a year after the shooting, McMillan and Gaete got engaged. They're planning to get married next year. McMillan said he'd like to return to work but is focusing on therapy to try to get back on his feet. There are desk jobs he could do, but his heart is in manning the courthouse or heading out on patrol. ""I want to do what I was doing before,"" he said, his clear eyes sparkling. ""Drive fast and chase bad guys."" A YEAR OF CHANGE After losing her left eye and getting shot in the other, Chelsea Romo was told it could take more than a year until she could see. But as the anniversary of the attack approaches, she can insert a lens to have nearly perfect vision in one eye, enabling her to read, drive and care for her young son and daughter. In the other, she is getting a hand-painted prosthetic and will soon undergo what could be the last of about half a dozen surgeries to help her heal. It hasn't been easy for the now-29-year-old. She hasn't resumed her computer-intensive hospital job, can't dunk in a swimming pool, and must use the heel of her foot to feel where one stair ends and the next one begins to avoid falling. But, she said, her doctors have called her recovery miraculous. ""Everything has changed,"" Romo said in an interview from her attorney's office in San Diego. ""But that is the thing — this is my new normal."" A year ago, Romo was working long hours at a Riverside County, California, hospital handling intakes and insurance. She was going through a divorce while living with her parents and raising two young children. When a friend got tickets to the Las Vegas festival, she headed out for her first weekend away. The pair managed to get up close to the front of the stage at the Jason Aldean show when she heard a sound and looked up. ""My girlfriend told me to duck down, and she looked at me and said, 'Your face,'"" Romo recalled. From there, everything turned orange. She could no longer see. An off-duty police officer and others at the concert crafted a gurney from a piece of broken fence and carried her to a golf cart, which took her to an ambulance. Romo's memory of those moments is blurry. She said she learned some of the details later from the officer, who over the last year has become her best friend. For a week, Romo said she was blind. Her left eye was shattered, and she couldn't see out of her right. Her faith helped carry her through those moments when doctors told her it could take a year, or more, for her to be able to see. She returned home to California and to more surgery to remove shrapnel from her eye. A week later, she said she could see, and in a month, her vision had improved even more. ""They kept telling me this is a miracle,"" said Romo, who took her children trick-or-treating on Halloween dressed up as a pirate with a patch covering her missing eye. Over the year, she has had half a dozen surgeries, and there are days where her eye is irritated and she can't use her lens. Every morning, her 2-year-old daughter wakes up, pulls back her bangs, and asks if her ""owie"" is OK. Her 6-year-old son worries something could happen to her when she goes out. The year has brought other changes, too. She started a relationship and became close friends with other Californians who survived the shooting. ""There are so many people who have become like family,"" she said. Now, she's focused on getting her prosthetic and moving into her own apartment for the first time — just ahead of the anniversary of the shooting. ""It was really scary,"" she said. ""But you know, a year later I am still here — so that's good."" 'HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND' A small home in Las Vegas has become a shrine to Erick Silva, who was killed in the shooting. Photos of the young man wearing security guard uniforms cover the window on the front porch. Newspaper cutouts, handwritten signs and a T-shirt with his photo are visible from the sidewalk, while flowers, a white wooden cross and other mementos make a makeshift altar next to the front door. Inside, poster-size portraits of Silva hang in the living room he shared with his mom, brother and stepfather. Oct. 1, 2017, transformed this house and the family that calls it home. That day, Silva was working as a security guard at the Route 91 Harvest Festival and was shot while helping people climb over a barricade to escape the gunfire. ""He was my best friend. ... He was my right hand. I wouldn't do anything without telling him,"" Silva's mom, Angelica Cervantes, said on a recent evening, leaning against his bed. ""I come here and talk to him at night. 'Help me with this. How are we going to make it?'"" She remembers like it was yesterday the morning she woke up to find news of the shooting on TV and the neighbor who came by to ask about her son because his truck was not in the driveway. The words of the woman who told her Silva was dead are seared in her memory. Her home, she said, was never the same. Silence has replaced the joy Silva brought to it. Cervantes has tried hard to find a new normal. She and her husband, Gregorio de la Rosa, are back at work. She goes to therapy and talks with church pastors. She even underwent a spiritual cleansing. She wrote three songs in her son's memory once the stream of visitors ended a few months after the shooting and she found herself alone. ""I remember that night full of shining stars in Las Vegas. Everything was ready for the concert one more time,"" Cervantes' ""Las Vegas Still Strong"" starts. ""But heaven was claiming another star. His name was Erick. Now he is watching over you and me."" She still cries, but she watches how often because she doesn't want her youngest son to see. They visit Silva's grave every week, and during a vacation, they took a framed picture of him on the trip and decorated it with scrapbooking stickers. The decorated frame now hangs in Silva's room next to the shelves that were installed after his death to display some of his belongings and other items. The black tennis shoes at the top of the shelves were the last Silva wore. His empty wallet, cellphone and security guard badges are there, too. There's also a flashlight, metal detector, cards, candles and four colognes, one still unopened. Parts of the room are frozen in time. Handwritten notes are on the wall just as he had left them. So is a certificate he won for eating a giant burger at a restaurant. The monitor on his desk still shows the feeds of the security cameras he had installed at his parents' home — nobody knows the password. His mother had to break a locked drawer where he kept important documents. She stored the blankets that he slept with. ""They smell like him,"" Cervantes said. Her youngest son sometimes does his homework on Silva's bed. Cervantes carries on her phone pictures showing her son standing next to the stage before the massacre. She proudly shows them to people since her son loved his job. He used part of his paychecks to help his family and, Cervantes said, he would buy her the red lipsticks she likes. He handed her $100 the day before he died. ""I already forgave him,"" she said of the gunman. ""Because if I continued living with anger, it would not be fair. My son is more important than that person."" EMOTIONAL SCARS The Route 91 Harvest Festival made for an annual girls' trip for Jessica Ha and her two girlfriends, who are big country music fans. The 23-year-old Newport Beach, California, resident and her friends managed to make it out of the festival without serious physical injuries. But emotionally and mentally, they're still processing what happened. ""It's a tragedy that has completely changed my life, for the rest of my life,"" Ha said. ""I've noticed that I'm more cautious in public places. When I hear loud things, I kind of get jumpy."" When the gunfire broke out, she and her friends dropped to the ground near the stage, where they were standing. A stranger — a young man Ha describes as being in his mid-20s with a flannel shirt — threw his body over hers to shield her. She has no idea who he was, and when the group got up and fled after 10 minutes, she never saw him again. She and her friends ran toward the back of the concert venue, where they helped someone in a wheelchair make their way out, before running toward a nearby casino, where rumors of another shooter sent them fleeing in another direction. She, her friends and about a dozen others eventually ended up in a nearby apartment, where two air ambulance pilots offered the group shelter. They stayed, checking the news and calling family members, until they got word around 5 a.m. that it was safe to leave. Ha and her friends walked back to their hotel, passing shoes, purses and towels left behind by concertgoers. ""I've never seen the Strip like that. Just quiet. No lights on,"" she said. The women collected their things at their hotel and had a somber ride home the next day. They haven't talked much about that night since. Ha, a human resources recruiter, later found another survivor with whom she could compare stories and process what happened. Another woman who was at the concert came in for a job interview after spending months out of work, trying to cope after the shooting. The women spent an hour comparing stories and bonding. Ha was eventually able to help the woman find a new position she loved — a job placement that Ha said meant more to her than any other. Ha learned about the woman's hiring while back in Las Vegas in May for the first time since the shooting, looking for some closure. ""You would never think coming back to such a tragic location would bring me so much joy,"" Ha said. She returned to the concert venue and walked around quietly with her boyfriend, taking in the scene. They noted the ""Vegas Strong"" messages on signs and bumper stickers throughout the city. ""It was honestly really comforting to go back and to feel that love and to really see an entire city understand what you went through,"" she said. She said she doesn't mind talking about what happened but tries not to think about the shooting every day. Instead she's trying to live her life for those who didn't make it that night. ""I feel really strongly about doing the best that I can because there's 58 people that were there with me that don't get that opportunity."" Ha noted she would like an answer about the gunman's motive, something Nevada law enforcement say they may never be able to determine. ""Initially I asked a lot of 'Why?'"" she said. ""For the most part, I've come to terms with the fact that he was a disturbed man."" ___ Taxin reported from Menifee and Santa Ana, California.

708,708,10862,http://us.cnn.com/2018/03/27/politics/repealing-the-second-amendment/index.html,There's not a 'snowflake's chance in hell' of repealing the Second Amendment,"(CNN) How could those high school kids have marched en masse and not achieved any meaningful reform? That seems to be the state of affairs: The gun laws seem intractably set, despite growing public support to change them, at least on the periphery of the laws. Measures passed in Florida after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting seem to have no prospects at the national level. But former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is not talking about frittering around the edges of anything. He issued a modest proposal in The New York Times to get rid of the Second Amendment altogether. Repeal it, he says Stevens argued that a right to bear arms, which the Supreme Court has said the Second Amendment guarantees, should mean something different in the era of today's weapons and today's civil society, and, in the spirit of many gun-control advocates, pointed out the Second Amendment is talking about militias when it brings up ""arms."" The entire text of the Second Amendment, remember, is this: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Stevens has railed in the past about how far we've gotten from the idea of militias in the interpretation of the Second Amendment -- and he channels that view in the op-ed. ""Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed,'"" he writes in the Times. ""Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century."" He then launches into a Supreme Court history lesson on how gun laws evolved from 1789 to a unanimous decision against sawed-off shotguns in 1939 because they weren't appropriate for use in a ""well-regulated militia"" -- through the landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller that threw the whole idea of a well-regulated militia out the window. That case changed the interpretation of the Second Amendment's clause concerning guns to be an individual right for self-defense. Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in the case, by the way, is a marvel of grammatical gymntastics , that decides the amendment is not about the well-regulated militia discussed in the text, but rather that ""it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home."" Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford, but he often sided with the more liberal wing of the court during his tenure and he resigned during the Obama administration, resulting in Elena Kagan being confirmed to take his spot on the bench. So he's bringing a more liberal mindset to this issue. It's also unlikely to happen. Probably ever. Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and Second Amendment expert who supports gun control, was tweeting Tuesday about Stevens' piece, and said, ""there's not a snowflake's chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment any time soon."" Of course all this overlooks the obvious problem: There's not a snowflakes chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment anytime soon. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 ""We can't even get Congress to pass a law banning bump stocks,"" Winkler wrote. ""We can't get Congress to mandate universal background checks. And Stevens thinks 2/3s of Congress will vote to repeal the 2A? And 3/4 of the states will ratify such an amendment? Nonsense."" But it's still worth examining whether repealing the Second Amendment is actually that what people want. There is, indeed, great support for tighter gun laws -- seven in 10 Americans said in a CNN poll after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting that they'd support new gun restrictions. That's the highest such support in 25 years. But on more specific proposals that could be seen as limiting gun rights, there were very partisan divides. A ban on semi-automatic weapons, for instance, had the support of 80% of Democrats and 53% of independents, but just 34% of Republicans, for instance. The idea of limiting the number of guns an individual can own garners 69% support among Democrats vs. just 23% among Republicans, according to that CNN poll. It's hard to find any recent reliable polling on the larger idea of repealing the amendment completely, but if there are sharp divides on specific efforts to curb gun rights, it's a good bet that an entire repeal would be even more controversial. A minority of American households have guns -- 30%, according to a Pew survey in 2017, with 16% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans owning guns. It's important here to say that Stevens did not say in his op-ed that guns should be taken away from anyone who has them, just that the Second Amendment should be repealed. What would be left to regulate the many millions of guns already in the country? That would have to be figured out. But you can hear the slogan opponents would use against an effort like Stevens' proposal: They're trying to take your guns away! In fact, that's a slogan President Donald Trump used effectively against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016 (and since then), accusing her of wanting to ""take your guns away"" even though Clinton said she was a supporter of Second Amendment rights. JUST WATCHED Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' 01:13 Winkler also argued that Stevens' proposal is counterproductive because it backs up the claim by Trump and the NRA that supporters of gun control want to take away guns. ""Stevens's call to repeal the 2A is not only ineffective but worse: it makes it even harder to pass good gun laws today. It plays right into the hands of the @nra which can now point to this op-ed and say, 'See, we told you they want to take away your rights and your guns.'"" Current Democratic leaders, even as they have pushed for new gun control, have made clear they support the Second Amendment. If national elections are going to be won and lost in the Rust Belt, Democrats will need support from gun rights supporters if they're going to win congressional or presidential elections. ""I believe in the Second Amendment, there's a right to bear arms,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in February. ""Every law-abiding citizen has the right to have a gun unless you're a felon, or you're adjudicated mentally ill, everyone agrees to that."" Even if Democrats turned wholesale against the Second Amendment (and gave up any claim they had on moderates and gun lovers in their party), there's the not-so-small difficulty of actually changing the Constitution. The Constitution has been amended 27 times in US history, including the original 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. The last amendment ratified was the 27th in 1992, which made it so Congress can't raise its own wages until the following Congress. That took decades to pass. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and CNN contributor, said it's not impossible to repeal the Second Amendment, but perhaps Stevens was trying to reframe the arguments. ""I wonder if Justice Stevens was trying to take a step back from the politics of the moment to situate the debate in a broader context,"" he said, although he pointed out that changes to the Constitution have been few and far between. ""There have only been 17 amendments in 231 years, and most of those have been about the structure of government/elections/voting, not substantive rights. It's really quite difficult to get an amendment through, especially on a divisive question of social policy,"" Vladeck said. None of the original 10 amendments has ever been repealed or changed, so you're well into uncharted territory with Stevens' idea. The only amendment which really took something away from citizens was the 18th Amendment, which was enacted in 1920 and made alcohol illegal on the national level. And maybe the precedent for what Stevens proposes is the 21st Amendment, by which the 18th Amendment was repealed 13 years later. It takes an amendment to repeal an amendment. Article V of the Constitution lays out that process, which requires supermajorities in Congress and of state legislatures and/or constitutional conventions. So politically and procedurally, Stevens' idea is a conversation-starter (and maybe a much-needed conversation-starter), but not much else. Repealing the Second Amendment isn't likely to happen any time soon. To say the least. But Stevens doesn't seem to be worried about those details. He's making a broader point about the court and guns. Later in his piece, Stevens suggests the entire aim of getting rid of the Second Amendment would be to overturn that decision in Heller, which made gun ownership an individual right. ""Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option,"" he writes. I agree! We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the 2A, gun control proponents need to mobilize politically. That seems to be happening now. https://t.co/IS1cYJuWwT — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 Winkler said marchers and other activists should stay the course they are on. ""We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the (Second Amendment), gun control proponents need to mobilize politically,"" he wrote. Vladeck argued there is plenty of gun control legislation that can be achieved under the current structure and he pointed to a Maryland assault weapons case as proof. ""So we may not need either a different Supreme Court or a constitutional amendment to achieve most of what reformers are seeking; we just need folks to realize that the principal objections to many of these proposals are political, not constitutional,"" Vladeck said.","Gun Remington Arms Remington Outdoor Company Inc.

Black Security Guard Shot Dead By Police After Subduing and Disarming Gunman,"A police officer responding to a shooting at an Illinois bar shot and killed a black security guard who had managed to disarm and subdue the suspect. Police were called after a gunfight broke out at Manny's Blue Room Bar in Robbins, just south of Chicago, at around 4 a.m. on November 11. Eyewitnesses said that 26-year-old Jemel Roberson managed to apprehend one of the men involved in the fight, take away his gun and force him to the ground. When officers arrived at the scene, Roberson still had the suspect subdued with his knee and licensed gun pressed against his back. According to witness Adam Harris, a Midlothian officer arrived at the scene and fired at Roberson when he saw him holding the suspect to the ground with his weapon. ""Everybody was screaming out, 'Security!' He was a security guard,"" Harris told WGN-TV. ""And they still did their job, and saw a black man with a gun, and basically killed him."" Midlothian police confirmed that an officer had ""encountered a subject with a gun"" and was involved in a shooting. ""The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,"" Chief Daniel Delaney of the Midlothian Police Department said in a statement. Four other people were injured during the incident, including the man believed to have fired the gun before officers arrived, Cook County Sheriff's spokeswoman Sophia Ansari told the Associated Press. The suspect, who has not been named, remains in hospital with injuries. The Illinois State Police have since taken over the handling of the investigation. Roberson, a 2010 graduate of Lane Tech High School who played on the school's basketball team, is reported to have been an aspiring police officer himself, according to CBS Chicago. ""Jemel had a big smile and a bigger heart. You will be missed,"" Lane Tech Basketball said in a tribute posted on Twitter. Roberson worked as a gospel musician at several churches. ""We called him choir boy—everybody called him choir boy,"" neighbor John Montgomery told CBS Chicago. A GoFundMe page set up to collect donations for Roberson's family has since gone on to raise more than $27,000. ""Jemel Roberson was a young man who was greatly loved by all who knew him,"" the description page reads. ""He was the light of his mother Beatrice's life, and was a devoted loving son. Jemel was a gifted basketball player and musician, and his love for God and his family were at the forefront of his life. ""Sadly, Jemel's life was tragically and unexpectedly cut short this morning as he tried to save others from senseless violence.

A long-term study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found eye injuries related to such non-powder guns increased by almost 170 percent during a 23-year period. ""The results of this study are certainly alarming,"" Dr. Jorge Gomez, primary sports medicine specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, told CBS News. The study, conducted by researchers at the Center for Injury Research and Policy of the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, looked at sports- and recreation-related eye injuries treated in children in U.S. emergency departments from 1990 to 2012. During that time, almost 442,000 children were taken to the ER for such injuries. That's an average of more than 19,200 children a year, or about two every hour. Most were treated and released, but almost 5 percent needed to be hospitalized. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox The data showed that while the overall rate of sports- and recreation-related eye injuries decreased slightly over that time, those associated with non-powder guns rose sharply. Children ages 10 to 17 had the highest rates of eye injuries. Boys were more likely to be injured than girls, accounting for three-fourths of all the cases. The two most common causes of eye injuries in the study were basketball and baseball/softball, which accounted for about 15 percent each; non-powder guns were blamed for nearly 11 percent of the eye injuries. But the non-powder gun injuries were more likely to be serious, accounting for nearly half of the cases severe enough to require hospitalization. About 79 percent of those hospitalizations were due to BB or pellet guns and 19 percent were associated with paintball guns. ""Eye injuries associated with sports and recreation are common but preventable,"" senior study author Dr. Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital, told CBS News. ""These injuries happen in an instant and can have significant lifelong effects. Increased prevention efforts are needed, especially for eye injuries associated with non-powder guns, which this study demonstrated are increasing."" He recommends parents heed the following recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) to make BB, pellet and paintball gun activities safer for children: Always wear eye protection that meets appropriate national standards when using non-powder guns. Teach children to shoot BB and pellet guns at paper or gel targets with a backstop that will trap BBs or pellets and prevent ricochet. Make sure that parents and children are educated on proper safety precautions for handling and using non-powder guns. Ensure that there is always appropriate adult supervision. The last point is particularly important, said Gomez, who was not involved in the study. ""It's very important for parents to understand that a child doesn't necessarily have the same understanding of how dangerous these guns are as an adult has,"" he said. ""The number one rule has to be safety first. They should only be used with adult supervision."" To help protect kids from eye injuries from basketball, baseball and softball, the AAP and AAO recommend the use of eye protection with polycarbonate lenses in basketball and face-masks and face-guards in baseball and softball. ""We want children to participate in sports,"" said Tracy Mehan, manager of Translational Research at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's. ""Wearing appropriate eye protection will help prevent injury and keep them in the game.""",Ophthalmology Eye Eye injury Child Eye examination Image Health Visual perception Portrait Injury,"A study found that more than 442,200 children were taken to the emergency department for similar injuries in the 1990-12 period.","New research suggests parents may need to take greater precautions when it comes to their children participating in activities using BB, pellet, and paintball guns.

Do not pull a fire alarm. That creates confusion as to whether what is happening is a drill, as happened in the recent shooting in Parkland, Fla., where the gunman himself pulled the alarm, the authorities said. An alarm could send people out of rooms and into large groups in hallways, where they would be targets, and draw emergency responders into danger as well. Instead, yell “gun” or “gunman.” Many workplaces and schools use drills to prepare workers and students for lockdowns and evacuations. But if you are someplace like a theater, look for the exits yourself. Mr. Kolasky, who worked with the National Association of Theatre Owners after the Aurora theater shooting in 2012, said public service announcements in theaters often point them out. But they are only successful “to the degree that people pay attention,” he said. Where do I hide? If escape is not an option, you should hide, although Dr. Blair prefers to use the more active term “deny access” rather than what he calls “hide and hope.” Dart into a room, closet, anywhere there is a door to lock, or at least to close and barricade.

""I don't think guns are the problem, they're in fact the answer,"" the 20-year-old said. ""When you have more security and you have more people carrying (firearms), that is deterrence in itself."" Gibson and thousands of fellow Republicans converged on the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, where they gather each year to celebrate their causes -- and, in 2018, the populist movement that swept President Donald Trump into office one year ago. Many speakers touted the administration's achievements including passing recent tax cuts, repealing job-killing regulations and appointing conservative judges. ""It's been a year of promises made and promises kept,"" Vice President Mike Pence told the CPAC crowd, as he offered tough words to North Korea and urged Republicans to gird for battle in hugely consequential congressional elections this November. The ongoing and deepening investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US election, and whether Trump's campaign colluded with Moscow, was barely a footnote in CPAC discussions. But it was impossible to ignore the ever-present tragedy of rampaging gun violence, which has roiled American political discourse and put gun rights advocates and opponents under a hot spotlight. While a moment of silence was held to honor the 17 people killed at a Florida high school, CPAC's attendees or speakers did not shy away from the issue. Several actually went on the offensive. NRA chief Wayne LaPierre hit back at what he called ""the shameful politicization of tragedy,"" fighting a rearguard defense against street protests and mounting demands to tighten America's permissive gun laws. In his first public comments since the Valentine's Day rampage, LaPierre reiterated long-standing accusations that gun control advocates were seeking to roll back constitutional protections. The powerful gun lobby's spokeswoman, Dana Loesch, took it further, saying that ""many in legacy media love mass shootings."" - Hardline voices - CPAC is a sprawling conservative hub promoting the ideals of liberty, economic prosperity and family values. Its panelists speak glowingly of iconic president Ronald Reagan, posters announce that ""big government sucks,"" and activists advocate for prayer in schools. It also appeals to fringe or hardline voices who relish the opportunity to push their agenda on a broad stage. A case in point: CPAC invited far-right former French MP Marion Marechal-Le Pen of the National Front to address the conference, raising concerns among some mainstream Republicans that CPAC was welcoming extremists. ""Just like you, we want our country back,"" the telegenic 28-year-old said, expressing solidarity with Trump's nationalist policies. In the halls of CPAC, talk often turned to guns -- and, importantly, how to respond to the latest slaughter at the hands of a rifle-wielding madman. Kelli Ward, a hardline conservative US Senate candidate from Arizona looking to fill the seat of retiring Senator Jeff Flake in November, said the national mourning over the Florida tragedy knows no political boundaries. ""I'm a life member of the NRA, I'm a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment, and my heart is also broken for what happened,"" she told AFP. But Ward also said attendees were focused on bread-and-butter conservative issues: restricting immigration, repealing the health care reforms known as Obamacare, and building up the military -- ""not because we want war, but because we want peace through strength."" At CPAC's exhibit hall, gun rights supporter Thomas White, 23, was helping a friend become an NRA member. He predicted Trump would draw a warm reception Friday when he returns to CPAC, despite the president's announcement of support for legislation that would expand background checks for gun purchases and ban devices that convert legal semi-automatic rifles into machine guns. ""I feel like more people are opening up to Trump because he's not the (traditional) mold,"" said White, who grew up using guns in rural Maine. Trump's words can be ""offensive,"" White admits.

At a gathering at Congregation Shir Hamaolot in Irvine, Calif., Jackie Menter, a co-founder of the Orange County Jewish Coalition for Refugees, shared her experience working with Middle Eastern and African refugees on the Greek island of Chios last year. She spoke of a Syrian girl who had watched a land mine kill her mother as they were fleeing captivity by the militant group Islamic State, and a man named Mustafa, who returned home to his apartment in the Syrian city of Aleppo to find the entire building bombed out and his wife, children and mother dead. Citing biblical passages about welcoming the stranger, Ms. Menter urged congregants to get involved with HIAS’s efforts to support refugees and asylum seekers. On Saturday night, after the attack on the synagogue in Pittsburgh, she said, “Evil, hatred and racism will not keep justice and mercy from prevailing.” The Trump administration has sharply reduced the number of people fleeing violence and persecution who are admitted to the United States as refugees, lowering the annual ceiling from the 110,000 set before Mr. Trump took office to 45,000 in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, and to 30,000 for fiscal 2019. Delays caused by extra levels of screening ordered by the Trump administration — targeting especially people from 11 countries, 10 of them predominantly Muslim — meant that only 22,491 refugees actually arrived in fiscal 2018.",Tree of Life Congregation Pittsburgh synagogue shooting  HIAS Shooting Tree Tree of life Mass shooting Synagogue,A memorial to the victims of the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday.,"In another post, he wrote: “You like to bring in hostile invaders to dwell among us?

(Photo: Johanne Rahaman for HuffPost) FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. ― Something powerful is happening in Florida. For the third straight day following a school shooting that left 17 dead and more than a dozen injured, community members gathered to demand gun control. And for those politicians who are in the pocket of the National Rifle Association, the people had another message: Be scared. On Saturday, more than a thousand Floridians swarmed around the federal courthouse in Fort Lauderdale to make their voices heard, refusing to let the shooting in Parkland fade into memory. Speakers included students, teachers and activists. The rally was sponsored by Moms Demand Action, the Broward Teachers Union, the League of Women Voters and other groups. Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, used to worry about tests. Now she worries about being shot. “My main concerns are funerals, gun control and whether or not I’m going to be shot wherever I go,” Tarr said. “My innocence ― our innocence ― has been taken from us. I’m 17, but in a matter of days have aged decades.” The gunman “slaughtered 17 of my people,” Tarr said. She’s asking for gun control so it doesn’t happen again. “Because of these gun laws, people I love have died,” she said. “Where’s the common sense in that? People are dying every day.” Another Stoneman Douglas High student, Emma Gonzalez, delivered a passionate and heartbreaking message to President Donald Trump. “If the president wants to come up to me and tell me to my face that it was a terrible tragedy and how it should have never have happened, and maintains telling us how nothing is going to be done about it, I’m going to happily ask him how much money he received from the National Rifle Association,” Gonzalez said. After the shooting, Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) stuck with offering “thoughts and prayers.” They both have “A+” ratings from the NRA, and have been endorsed by the gun lobby during their campaign runs. Story continues “Vote them out! Vote them out!” Saturday’s crowd chanted at one point in reference to Scott and Rubio. To those politicians who have received money from the @NRA. pic.twitter.com/GhwptHSupU — Sebastian Murdock (@SebastianMurdoc) February 17, 2018 Among the officials speaking to the crowd, Coral Springs Commissioner Dan Daley, a graduate of Stoneman Douglas, said Florida has become the “gunshine state.” “Lives were cut short by one person who had no business to own an assault rifle,” Daley said. The gunman obtained an AR-15 and “used it for death and destruction.” “That’s not OK,” the commissioner said. “That’s insane.” Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said the way to take down gun-loving politicians is simple: vote. “We’ve got to vote,” Runcie told the crowd, to cheers. “We’ve got to vote. We’ve got to vote. If there’s no vote, this is just going to be a bunch of noise.” People gathered at the Fort Lauderdale federal courthouse on Feb. 17, 2018, to call for gun control in the wake of the deadly high school shooting in Parkland, Florida.

A former flight attendant, McBath then became an activist, working with Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. In 2013, she became the National Spokesperson for Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and she then took on the additional role as the Faith and Outreach Leader for Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action. She's also a part of Mothers of the Movement, a group of women whose children have been killed by the police or gun violence; she appeared with them on stage at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. EMILY's List and the Democratic Party of Georgia have given McBath awards for her activism and political participation, but it was Rep. Renitta Shannon who told her she needed to run for Congress.

But it's not meant to catch early warning signs like those exhibited by Nikolas Cruz, the man identified as the shooter who allegedly killed 17 at a South Florida high school on Valentine's Day. On Thursday, details emerged about Cruz's extensive presence online. He brandished guns and knives while making racist remarks against Muslims. And, it appears, he even made explicit threats that foreshadowed Wednesday's massacre. Last fall, a YouTube user going by the name ""nikolas cruz"" left the following comment beneath another person's video: ""Im going to be a professional school shooter."" However, Cruz passed the FBI's background check to be able to purchase his AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle in the past year, according to a U.S. official briefed on the investigation. He was able to pass the background check because the system screens for certain indicators of past violence, misconduct, and mental health issues — but not all. The scope of review is narrow and would not capture all aspects of Cruz's profile, even if it included explicit, public threats against students and school disciplinary behavior that led to his expulsion from high school.

Yet his social media history makes disturbing reading, full of anti-Semitic anger and hate. Shortly before he burst into the place of worship yelling ""all Jews must die"" on Saturday morning, the 46-year-old posted his final message on Gab, a social media platform popular with free speech advocates and white supremacists. “HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in,” he said, using the acronym for the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, a Maryland-based nonprofit group that helps refugees around the world find safety and freedom. His 20 minute rampage left 11 people dead and six others wounded, including four police officers, in what is believed to be the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent US history. Bowers, himself, was shot several times as he traded fire with police. He was in fair condition in hospital on Saturday night. This image shows a portion of an archived webpage from the social media website Gab, with a posting by Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers Credit: AP The suspect was charged with 29 federal counts, including hate crimes and weapons offences, federal charges that carry the death penalty. A Federal Bureau of Investigation official said he was not previously known to law enforcement. Bob Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, said law enforcement authorities believe he was acting alone but had not identified his full motive. Bowers had 21 guns registered to his name, according to Representative Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania. Authorities said Bowers was armed with an assault rifle and at least three handguns when he burst into the Tree of Life synagogue. A picture of the individual began to emerge on Saturday night through his social media history. Bowers appears to be the author of a recent rash of violently anti-Semitic posts on the Gab.com social networking website, where conspiracy theories are common. Story continues Police stand guard outside the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh where a shooter opened fire Credit: AP A quote atop the Bowers page said ""jews are the children of satan,"" according to screenshots of the now-suspended account released by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors extremist movements. The cover photo featured the neo-Nazi symbol ""1488."" The first two numbers refer to the white supremacist ""14 Words"" slogan, while ""88"" stands for ""Heil Hitler"" since ""H"" is the eighth letter of the alphabet. Among his recent posts, Bowers posted a photo of a fiery oven like those used in Nazi concentration camps used to cremate Jews, writing the caption ""Make Ovens 1488F Again."" In other posts he featured memes containing false conspiracy theories suggesting the Holocaust - in which an estimated 6 million Jews perished - was a hoax. A message posted 17 days before Saturday's attack accused HIAS of bringing ""in hostile invaders to dwell among us"" - and appeared to threaten one of the organisation's projects. ""We appreciate the list of friends you have provided,"" the poster wrote, while linking to an event page for a ""National Refugee Shabbat."" HIAS called the attack a ""horrifying tragedy,"" saying ""this loss is our loss."" In another post reported by The New York Times, Bowers said he did not care for President Donald Trump, because he ""is a globalist, not a nationalist."" Using a slur for Jews, he said: ""There is no #MAGA, as long as there is a k-- infestation."" MAGA refers to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. Bowers also recently posted a photo of a collection of three black semi-automatic handguns he titled ""my glock family,"" a reference to the Austrian firearms manufacturer. He also shared photos of bullet holes in person-sized targets at a firing range, touting the ""amazing trigger"" on his weapon. Police vehicles block off the road near the home of Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect Robert Bowers' home in Baldwin borough suburb of Pittsburgh Credit: Reuters Bowers was registered in Allegany County, which includes Pittsburgh, as an unaffiliated voter. He lived about a 25-minute drive south of the synagogue in a neighbourhood that has been left shocked by the attack. One woman said she couldn't believe the national epidemic of violent hate had reached their doorsteps. “I can’t believe it has spread out this far,” she told the New York Times. Gab, a popular site with white nationalists and members of the so-called alt-right, released a statement saying it had ""zero tolerance"" for violence or terrorism and was ""saddened and disgusted by the news"" from Pittsburgh. Gab said in a post that after learning of the attack, it had matched the name of the alleged shooter to the holder of its account. It then took down the Bowers account and immediately contacted the FBI, adding: ""We will do everything in our power to work with law enforcement to see that justice is served.""",Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Tree of Life Congregation Shooting Suspect Synagogue Criminal charge Gab Antisemitism Mass shooting Massacre,"Robert Bowers, the suspect in the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh.","Robert Bowers, the suspect of the attack at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh - AFP Robert Bowers, the suspect in the deadly shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue, appears to have no criminal record.

The incident reports, which are as recent as September 2016, describe Cruz as suffering from mental illness and being ""emotionally handicapped,"" and being on behavioral medication. One notes, ""He has mentioned in the past that he would like to purchase a firearm."" The documents include more than 30 reports going back as far as 2011, covering misbehavior by Cruz and some by his younger brother. They add further depth to the emerging portrait of Cruz as an unstable teen who had long been on the radar of law enforcement, behavioral specialists, teachers and fellow students. Yet Cruz was still able to pass the nation's gun background check system in February 2017 and obtain an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle, one that he used to kill 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Valentine's Day. Police records about emergency calls to his home describe fights at home -- and a mother's concern about a son out of her control even as an adolescent. The emergency calls that the police received from the home included incidents categorized as ""mentally ill person,"" ""child/elderly abuse,"" ""domestic disturbance"" and ""missing person."" At least two calls reported Cruz as missing, in 2012 and 2013. The day before one of those incidents, in November 2012, Cruz's mother Lynda called to report that he had hit her with the plastic hose of a vacuum cleaner. The young man's father, Roger P. Cruz, purchased the home in 1996 and the family lived there until they sold the home in early 2017, county property records show. Roger Cruz died in 2004, and Lynda died in November. The vast majority of the police calls resulted in ""no paperwork filed,"" according to a list obtained by CNN on Thursday. But the few that are described in police reports detail Cruz's multiple outbursts. Lynda Cruz called police to their home on January 15, 2013, records show. According to a police report, she said 14-year-old Nikolas had refused to go to school that day, so she took away his Xbox ""privileges"" and stashed the computer game system in her vehicle. That enraged her teen, who ""retaliated and threw a chair, dog bowl and a drinking glass across the room."" The boy called his mother ""a useless bitch"" and other profanities she wouldn't share with police, she said. The mother told police her son had a ""history of developmental and learning disabilities,"" was ""increasingly irate"" and suffered from ADHD. Police placed the teen in handcuffs and sat him in the back of the police car as cops interviewed his mom. Nina Barela, a counselor from the nearby Henderson Behavioral Health facility, where Cruz was a client for years, arrived at the home and ""gave Nikolas his prescribed medication."" The boy soon ""began to calm down and cooperated."" Based on that fact and that he ""did not make any threats of harm to him or others,"" the report said, Barela advised that it was unnecessary to invoke a Florida law allowing police to put a mentally ill person in custody. ""A Baker Act was not needed,"" the report said. Florida school shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz at his arrest Wednesday. Broward County Sheriff's deputies were called to the Parkland, Florida, home four days after Cruz's 18th birthday. He had lashed out at his mother over a disagreement about the paperwork he needed to get a Florida State identification card. Lynda Cruz was worried, she told police. Back when he was too young to legally buy a rifle, her son had mentioned he wanted to buy a gun. Now he was ""cutting his arms ... to get attention,"" she told them, according to one police report dated September 28, 2016. The responding officer wrote that Cruz's therapist from Henderson, Jared Bienenfeld, was ""on the scene at the home and deemed Nikolas to be no threat to anyone or himself at this present time."" An investigator with the Florida Department of Children and Families, Beatrice Thomas, was also there to check on the teen's well-being. These reports add pivotal details to accounts by neighbors, who told CNN that Cruz grew up in a home that received frequent visits from law enforcement. A former schoolmate, Brody Speno, said he knew Cruz since elementary school. He described him as ""an evil kid"" who was ""always getting in trouble."" He recalled Cruz stealing people's mail, throwing rocks at cars and tormenting animals. He described one incident in which he said Cruz ""cornered a squirrel and was trying to throw rocks at it and kill it."" Cruz was eventually expelled for disciplinary reasons from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, where he would later return to commit this week's massacre. Sunrise Tactical, the gun store in Coral Springs, Florida, that sold a gun to Nikolas Cruz. In early 2017, Cruz bought an AR-15-style rifle from a small nearby gun store, Sunrise Tactical Supply in Coral Springs. Officials say he passed the required government background check, and bought it legally. Thursday evening, a lawyer for the gun shop owner delivered this statement to news reporters: ""The Morrisons here sold a lawful weapon to someone who was mentally ill. Someone who fell through the cracks. Someone who was not held accountable for their actions when they were expelled from school. Someone who was not put into any sort of database and someone who was essentially allowed to go unchecked before walking into this store and purchasing a firearm,"" said Douglas Rudman, the attorney representing shop owner Michael F. Morrison. The nation's gun-buying background check system is supposed to keep firearms out of reach for dangerous individuals. But it's not meant to catch early warning signs like those exhibited by Cruz. The system checks for felony convictions, instances of domestic violence, addiction to illegal drugs and involuntary commitments due to mental illness. But it does not check for school expulsions, other mental health history or domestic disturbances that do not result in criminal charges. The system also does not review a person's public statements or explicit threats to commit violence, such as Cruz's multiple comments online -- in his own name -- in which he boldly declared his intentions.

The other was a former high school football player who loved to play the online version of his favorite sport, and had won $51,000 in his short gaming career. They both died in the shooting at the GLHF Game Bar on Sunday, where they were attending a tournament for competitive players of the football video game, Madden. The winners would go on to a higher level tournament in Las Vegas in October, where large cash prizes could be won. The shooting left 10 injured from gunshots and one person with a non-gunshot injury, Sheriff Mike Williams said. All of the injured are expected to survive, he said. Three of the four people hospitalized at Memorial Hospital have been released, officials said. The sheriff's office on Monday identified the two victims who died as Elijah Clayton and Taylor Robertson.

674,674,110337,https://abcnews.go.com/Health/gun-control-mental-health-care-debate-mass-shootings/story?id=59294750,Gun control vs. mental health care: debate after mass shootings obscures murky reality,"Gun control vs. mental health care: debate after mass shootings obscures murky reality Experts say that blaming the violence on the mentally ill is inaccurate. This story is from Kaiser Health News After the recent mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., in which 11 people were killed at a country music bar, President Donald Trump struck a familiar refrain: “It’s a mental health problem,” he said of the gunman, Ian David Long. “He was a very sick puppy.” Similarly, after a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., that killed 17 students and staff members in February, Trump tweeted that there were “so many signs that the shooter was mentally disturbed.” Public health and mental health experts counter that blaming the violence on the mentally ill is unfair and inaccurate, pointing instead to lax gun laws. “Most violence is not committed by people who are mentally ill,” said Dr. Renée Binder, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California-San Francisco and a past president of the American Psychiatric Association. “Even if you took everyone who had any kind of mental illness and locked them up and gave them meds, it would hardly make a dent on the problem of violence.” Post-shooting debates typically are painted in black and white — but research suggests that the truth is less clear-cut. The “stigma-busting advocates,” who insist that mental illness has no connection to violence, and the “fearmongers,” who assert that “the mentally ill are a dangerous menace and should be locked up,” are both wrong, said Jeffrey Swanson, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University who has studied patterns of violence in major U.S. cities. While it is true that mental illness plays only a small role in most forms of violence, including individual homicides, its role is larger in mass shootings. About 60 percent of mass shooters have a history of serious mental disorders and two-thirds had never been seen by a mental health professional, said Grant Duwe, director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, who has spent years studying mass public shootings. While that suggests a greater need for treatment, the one-third who did get help “carried out an attack anyway,” he said. “So, even getting mental health care is not the panacea people make it out to be.” For instance, James Holmes, who killed 12 people in an Aurora, Colo., theater in 2012, had been treated by a psychiatrist and spoken of homicidal thoughts. But he was not reported to authorities because he voiced no concrete plan. Seung-Hui Cho, whose mental problems dated to childhood, repeatedly talked to campus counselors two years before he killed 32 people and wounded 17 others at Virginia Tech University in 2007. Diagnosed with a mood disorder after threatening to harm himself in 2005, he was hospitalized overnight and ordered by a judge to receive outpatient treatment. But, mysteriously, he was not assessed or treated. Often, shooters’ propensity for violence is easier to see in hindsight. Six months before the shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, police responded to a 911 call about yelling and banging coming from inside the house where Long, the alleged shooter, was living with his mother. They found an “irate” young man acting “irrationally” and called in a mental health crisis team. The social workers on that team evaluated and concluded there were no grounds to place him under a psychiatric hold. It is unclear whether the officers were told of his history as a machine gunner in Afghanistan, which after the shooting led to speculation he might have had post-traumatic stress disorder. Only later did it emerge that Long had allegedly assaulted a track coach in high school. California allows authorities to place people on a 72-hour hold to evaluate their mental states — a practice similar to that in many states. But the standard for such holds, known in California as a “5150,” is quite high, said Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency physician who heads the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center at UC-Davis. To be held, a person must pose a serious imminent threat to themselves or others or be so gravely disabled that they can’t take care of themselves, he said. The law does not take substance abuse into account, Wintemute said. “A 5150 involves taking a person into custody sometimes against their will,” Wintemute said. “That’s not something that’s done lightly.” Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, the psychiatrist who founded the Treatment Advocacy Center 20 years ago, long has argued that society needs to be more forceful in getting care for the severely disturbed — and requiring it when necessary — to prevent suicide, mass shootings and other violence. His goal is to get more state legislatures to pass bills like Kendra’s Law in New York and Laura’s Law in California that allow judges to order mentally ill people into outpatient treatment. His organization helped draft both those bills and has helped win passage of similar laws in at least 16 states. In California and some other states, however, the reach of the law is limited by whether counties decide to implement the approach. Duwe takes no position on the idea of mandated treatment but said that doing so to prevent events that happen only a few times a year makes little sense. “Mass public shootings are more commonplace than they ought to be, but they are still too infrequent to design policies based on addressing such rare events,” he said. Gun laws that exclusively target people with mental health histories also make little sense, said Drs. James Knoll and George Annas, psychiatry professors at SUNY Upstate Medical Center, in a 2016 article in Psychiatry Online. They “will be extremely low yield, ineffective, and wasteful of scarce resources,” they wrote. Wintemute argued that other strategic interventions may work better. He advocates fixing problems in the nationwide system of background checks, which requires firearm dealers to verify with the FBI that a purchaser isn’t a felon, fugitive, domestic abuser or dangerously mentally ill. He said flaws in the law include the fact that private sales, including those at gun shows, are exempt; only federal, but not state, agencies are required to submit data to the background-check database; and thousands of cases of violence by military service members — including that of a shooter who killed 26 people in a Texas church in 2017 — are not reported. Wintemute also helped draft a California law that took effect in 2016 that allows family members or law enforcement officials to seek a temporary restraining order barring a potentially violent person from purchasing guns and removing any already in their possession. These so-called gun violence restraining orders don’t involve a mental health assessment, Wintemute said, but are designed to let family members temporarily get guns away from a relative at risk of doing harm, including suicides. The order can last up to three weeks and can be extended for up to a year after a hearing, in which the gun owner can ask a judge to return the weapon. In California, 190 orders were issued through the end of last year, Wintemute said, results he described as disappointing. Numbers for this year have not yet been compiled, but Wintemute said they are growing. So far, 13 states have passed similar laws, beginning with Connecticut in 1999. Eight, including Florida, approved them in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting, and Florida has already issued 450 such orders, Wintemute said. Physicians can play a key role by asking patients and family members if they own guns and encouraging the family to seek a gun order if they’re worried, Wintemute added. “If physicians are willing to see this as ‘If you see something, say something,’ and bring it to families’ attention, we could decrease rates of suicide and possibly mass shootings,” he said.

Unified on school safety,"The Thursday morning shooting at Salvador Castro Middle School in Westlake brings clashing concerns about weapons on campus face to face. On one side are civil rights advocates, as well as some parents and charter school operators, who decry the Los Angeles Unified School District’s policy of randomly searching students every day at every middle and high school, using metal detecting wands. It’s humiliating and interrupts school time, they justifiably contend. On the other side are district officials and parents who say, with equal justification, that any embarrassment is minor compared with the safety issue of keeping deadly weapons off campus. Some will look at the most recently shooting, which critically injured a 15-year-old boy, as evidence that the searches are needed. Others will see an ineffective policy that didn’t prevent a gun injury on campus. The shame of the matter is that no one really knows because, despite years of challenges to the random searches (known as “wanding”), the district still hasn’t taken a comprehensive look at whether its policy is effective. Nor has it examined whether other forms of violence protection might be just as effective without the intrusiveness that fosters a culture of mistrust between students and school staff. Advertisement During the 2014-15 school year, searches yielded more than 800 weapons, most of them knives and blades. Fifteen were firearms. But in addition to finding contraband, district officials insist, the random searches serve as a deterrent and that the numbers of weapons being carried on campus would be much higher without it. Maybe that’s true. Maybe not. The problem is that, more than a year and a half after this page called on the district to gather the necessary facts, it still hasn’t gotten to the bottom of the issue. Despite years of challenges to the random searches (or ‘wanding’), the district still hasn’t taken a comprehensive look at whether its policy is effective. What it has done is an audit that found the search policy was followed erratically, lending credence to critics who describe the searches as uneven and unfair, targeting some students over others. Despite the district’s rules, some schools don’t conduct searches every day. Some don’t have enough wands to get the job done. And this was an audit of only 20 schools; who knows what’s going on at scores more? Advertisement Late last year, acting Supt. Vivian Ekchian said she would commission a survey of attitudes about the searches. But this is about much more than attitudes; the key issue isn’t how people feel about weapons searches, but whether they are necessary to keep students safe. The district could run its own experiment with different security measures at various campuses, including safe passage programs to help students get safely to and from school. Opponents of the searches have contended that providing transportation would do more to ensure student safety than any number of metal-detecting wands. School leaders also could look outside the district for answers: The National Center for Education Statistics reports that random weapons searches have lost favor at many schools. In 2000, 7% of schools around the country conducted the searches; by 2014, that had dropped to 4%. What has happened at the schools that stopped? Are they just as safe? Perhaps even safer? What methods are they using? Or, perhaps, weapons have become problematic at those schools, indicating that searches are justified. L.A. Unified began the random searches after two 1993 shooting incidents in which students were killed on campus. That’s an understandable reaction. But crime rates have fallen dramatically in the decades since then, and the policy needs a thorough examination. Advertisement The district has an unfortunate tendency to institute programs without the necessary follow-up to ensure that they actually work. Issues dangle instead of being resolved. That’s what happened when the district took notice of its problems with chronic truancy. It started a few attendance pilots at various schools but never looked into which ones should be expanded and which ones had little effect. Ultimately, an outside panel delved into the issue and came up with a plan that the district recently embraced. Safety on campus is an even more important matter. We’d rather do without the searches if possible; students should be treated like eager learners, not suspects. But it would be even worse for students to feel — and be — in danger. District officials need to get beyond the debate and get the evidence on how to protect students properly. Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionand Facebook",Salvador B.

Three hours before Thursday’s season opener at Marlins Park, a mere 45 miles south of where the massacre took place, Rizzo specified for the first time what that change would entail. Addressing news reporters while wearing a T-shirt that read “#MSDStrong’’ in support of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, the site of a Feb. 14 mass shooting that has gripped the nation, Rizzo was asked what a gun law would be like in his perfect world. “In a perfect world, make it stricter, make background checks a little harder to get these guns,’’ said Rizzo, who had previously skirted specifics on the topic of gun control. “I think it’s a little too easy to go in there and get a gun. I think pretty much the entire nation can agree on that. There’s a number of other things, but my biggest thing is you can make it harder to get guns.’’ MORE MLB That has been the message spread by a number of current students at Douglas High, who helped organize a “March for our Lives’’ last weekend that drew hundreds of thousands of participants to Washington, D.C. There were also an estimated 800-plus similar other demonstrations across the U.S. and overseas. The students have been demanding a ban on assault weapons such as the AR-15 that was used in the Douglas attack and several mass killings, along with a higher age requirement for buying guns and universal background checks on purchases. “I think it’s amazing. These kids are standing up for what they believe in,’’ Rizzo said. “They’re motivating everyone to go there and register to vote, which is amazing. That’s a powerful way to get your voice heard, to go out and vote. They’re holding the throttle down on all these politicians, holding them accountable for what they believe in. It’s just unbelievable how the entire nation is rallying around (them).’’ Rizzo, the 2017 winner of the Roberto Clemente award for community service, has been baseball’s most prominent figure linked to the tragedy, although MLB in general and the Marlins specifically have taken steps to honor the victims. The day after the shooting, Rizzo left the Cubs’ training camp in Arizona to join his grieving community in Parkland, Fla., where he grew up and still lives. During a vigil at the school, he delivered a heartfelt speech of support and hope. The tragedy could not get much more personal for him. Not only has Rizzo remained in contact with the school and become a benefactor, paying for new lighting for the baseball field, but he played football for one of the victims, assistant coach and security guard Aaron Feis. On Tuesday night, Rizzo attended a Douglas baseball game and watched the Eagles cruise to a 15-0 victory. Before Friday’s game against the Marlins, he will present a check for money raised to benefit victims’ families. Four of those relatives will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. “Tomorrow will be a tough one to see for everyone who has a pulse,’’ Rizzo said. “It’s really cool how the Marlins have supported Douglas, how pretty much every sports franchise has.’’ Fellow Cubs players wore the same maroon T-shirt Rizzo had on during batting practice. Rizzo also issued a vigorous defense for the most vocal of the student group, led by Emma Gonzalez and David Hogg, who have been subject to doubts and attacks from political and media figures and others online. “For them to be getting bullied on Twitter by some guy with strong fingers, I think it’s pretty funny,” Rizzo said. “I know for a fact that they’re not going to let anything affect them in their mission. What they’re doing is bigger than themselves and it’s for love."" The three-time All-Star said he has talked to teachers at the school and they have told him most students are doing well as they recover from the shock of the incident, and he’s proud that so many of them have become involved in an effort to prevent such future calamities. “We’ve never seen this before in our country,’’ Rizzo said. “We’ve never seen an 11-year-old speaking at a rally, multiple 11-year-olds, a 6-year-old. So I think the nation’s listening. I think some politicians are maybe shaking a little bit, a little nervous.

But there’s less consensus on whether media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence, which is a more serious form of aggression in which the perpetrator is subject to arrest and incarceration — the sort of violence that includes using a weapon to harm or kill people. The link between media violence and mass shootings is even more tenuous. Compared with acts of aggression and violence, mass shootings are relatively rare events, which makes conducting conclusive research on them difficult. President Trump first raised the issue during a meeting on school safety with local and state officials, which took place a week after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The shooter, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, reportedly obsessively played violent video games. Trump, Feb. 22: We have to look at the Internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds, and their minds are being formed. And we have to do something about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it. And also video games. I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts. And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies, they’re so violent. Trump discussed the issue again with members of Congress on Feb. 28 during another meeting on school safety. During that discussion, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, now running for the Senate, claimed mothers have told her they’re “very concerned” that “exposure” to entertainment media has “desensitized” children to violence. Previously:Trump to meet with video game makers on whether games cause violence More:Video games are good for children, no matter what Trump says More:Facebook pulls violent virtual reality games from CPAC booth after Parkland Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley also said during the meeting: “[Y]ou see all these films about everybody being blown up. Well, just think of the impact that makes on young people.” The points Trump and members of Congress raise aren’t unfounded, but the research on the subject is complex. Scientists who study the effect of media violence have taken issue with how the popular press has portrayed their work, arguing that the nuance of their research is often left out. In a 2015 review of the scientific literature on video game violence, the American Psychological Association elaborates on this point. APA, 2015: News commentators often turn to violent video game use as a potential causal contributor to acts of mass homicide. The media point to perpetrators’ gaming habits as either a reason they have chosen to commit their crimes or as a method of training. This practice extends at least as far back as the Columbine massacre (1999). … As with most areas of science, the picture presented by this research is more complex than is usually depicted in news coverage and other information prepared for the general public. Here, we break down the facts — nuance included — on the effect of media violence on young people. Is media violence a risk factor for aggression? The 2015 report by the APA on video games is a good place to start. After systematically going through the scientific literature, the report’s authors “concluded that violent video game use has an effect on aggression.” In particular, the authors explain that this effect manifests as an increase in aggressive behaviors, thoughts and feelings and a decrease in helping others, empathy and sensitivity to aggression. Though limited, evidence also suggests that “higher amounts of exposure” to video games is linked to “higher levels of aggression,” the report said. The report emphasized that “aggression is a complex behavior” caused by multiple factors, each of which increases the likelihood that an individual will be aggressive. “Children who experience multiple risk factors are more likely to engage in aggression,” the report said. More:Kentucky governor blames violent video games, movies, not guns for school shootings More:States with the most (and least) gun violence. See where your state stacks up. The authors came to their conclusions because researchers have consistently found the effect across three different kinds of studies: cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies and laboratory experiments. “One method’s limits are offset by another method’s strengths,” the APA report explains, so only together can they be used to infer a causal relationship. Cross-sectional studies find correlations between different phenomena at one point in time. They’re relatively easy to conduct, but they can’t provide causal evidence because correlations can be spurious. For example, an increase in video game sales might correlate with a decrease in violent crime, but that doesn’t necessarily mean video games prevent violent crime. Other unknown factors might also be at play. Longitudinal panel studies collect data on the same group over time, sometimes for decades. They’re used to investigate long-term effects, such as whether playing video games as a child might correlate with aggression as an adult. These studies also measure other risk factors for aggression, such as harsh discipline from parents, with the aim of singling out the effect of media violence. For this reason, these studies provide better evidence for causality than cross-sectional studies, but they are more difficult to conduct. Laboratory experiments manipulate one phenomenon — in this case, exposure to media violence — and keep all others constant. Because of their controlled environment, experiments provide strong evidence for a causal effect. But for the same reason, laboratory studies may not accurately reflect how people act in the real world. This brings us to why debate still exists among scientists studying media violence. Some researchers have found that the experimental evidence backing the causal relationship between playing video games and aggression might not be as solid as it seems. Last July, Joseph Hilgard, an assistant professor of psychology at Illinois State University, and others published a study in the journal Psychological Bulletin that found that laboratory experiments on the topic may be subject to publication bias. This means that studies that show the effect may be more likely to be published than those that don’t, skewing the body of evidence. After Hilgard corrected for this bias, the effect of violent video games on aggressive behavior and emotions did still exist, but it was reduced, perhaps even to near zero. However, the effect on aggressive thoughts remained relatively unaffected by this publication bias. The researchers also found that cross-sectional studies weren’t subject to publication bias. They didn’t examine longitudinal studies, which have shown that youth who play more violent video games are more likely to report aggressive behavior over time. Hilgard looked at a 2010 literature review by Craig A. Anderson, the director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University, and others. Published in Psychological Bulletin, this review influenced the APA’s report. In response, Anderson took a second look at his review and found that the effect of violent video games on aggression was smaller than he originally thought, but not as small as Hilgard found. For this reason, he argued the effect was still a “societal concern.” To be clear, Hilgard is arguing that there’s more uncertainty in the field than originally thought, not that video games have no effect on aggression. He’s also not the first to find that research on video games may be suffering from publication bias. But what about movies and television? Reviews of the literature on these forms of media tend to be less recent, Kenneth A. Dodge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, told us by email. Dodge, also one of the authors of the 2015 APA study, pointed us to one 1994 review of the literature on television published in the journal Communication Research that concluded that television violence also “increases aggressiveness and antisocial behavior.” Dodge told us he’s “confident” the effect this analysis and others found “would hold again today.” Dodge also pointed us to a 2006 study that reviewed the literature on violent video games, films, television and other media together. “Most contemporary studies start with the premise that children are exposed [to violence] through so many diverse media that they start to group them together,” said Dodge. Published in JAMA Pediatrics, the review found that exposure to violent media increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior, thoughts and feelings. The review also found media decreases the likelihood of helping behavior. All of these effects were “modest,” the researchers concluded. Overall, most of the research suggests media violence is a risk factor for aggression, but some experts in the field still question whether there’s enough evidence to conclusively say there’s a link. Is violent media a risk factor for violence? There’s even less evidence to suggest media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence. “In psychological research, aggression is usually conceptualized as behavior that is intended to harm another,” while, “[v]iolence can be defined as an extreme form of physical aggression,” the 2015 APA report explains. “Thus, all violence is aggression, but not all aggression is violence.” The APA report said studies have been conducted on media violence’s relationship with “criminal violence,” but the authors “did not find enough evidence of sufficient utility to evaluate whether” there’s a solid link to violent video game use. This lack of evidence is due, in part, to the fact that there are ethical limitations to conducting experiments on violence in the laboratory, especially when it comes to children and teens, the report explains. That leaves only evidence from cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies. So what do those studies say? One longitudinal study, published in the journal Developmental Psychology in 2003, found that, out of 153 males, those who watched the most violent television as children were more likely 15 years later “to have pushed, grabbed, or shoved their spouses, to have responded to an insult by shoving a person” or to have been “to have been convicted of a crime” during the previous year. Girls who watched the most violent television were also more likely to commit similar acts as young women. These effects persisted after controlling for other risk factors for aggression, such as parental aggression and intellectual ability. A 2012 cross-sectional study that Anderson, at Iowa State, and others published in the journal Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice did find that the amount of violent video games juvenile delinquents played correlated with how many violent acts they had committed over the past year. The violent acts included gang fighting, hitting a teacher, hitting a parent, hitting other students and attacking another person. However, a 2008 review of the literature published in the journal Criminal Justice and Behavior concluded that “the effects of exposure to media violence on criminally violent behavior have not been established.” But the authors clarify: “Saying that the effect has not been established is not the same as saying that the effect does not exist.” In contrast to the APA report, Anderson and a colleague argue in a 2015 article published in American Behavioral Scientist that “research shows that media violence is a causal risk factor not only for mild forms of aggression but also for more serious forms of aggression, including violent criminal behavior.” Why did Anderson and his colleagues come to different conclusions than the APA? He told us that the APA “did not include the research literature on TV violence,” and excluded “several important studies on video game effects on violent behavior published since 2013.” In their 2015 article, Anderson and his colleague clarify that, even if there is a link, it “does not mean that violent media exposure by itself will turn a normal child or adolescent who has few or no other risk factors into a violent criminal or a school shooter.” They add, “Such extreme violence is rare, and tends to occur only when multiple risk factors converge in time, space, and within an individual.” Multiple experts we spoke with did point to one factor unique to the United States that they argue increases the risk of mass shootings and lethality of violence in general — access to guns. For example, Anderson told us by email: “There is a pretty strong consensus among violence researchers in psychology and criminology that the main reason that U.S. homicide rates are so much higher than in most Western democracies is our easy access to guns.” Dodge, at Duke, echoed Anderson’s point.”The single most obvious and probably largest difference between a country like the US that has many mass shootings and other developed countries is the easy access to guns,” he said. So while scientists disagree about how much evidence is enough to sufficiently support a causal link between media violence and real world violence, Trump and other politicians’ concerns aren’t unfounded.

The hotel was the scene of the the worst mass shooting in modern U.S. history when a gunman killed 58 people at a country music festival in 2017. (AP Photo/John Locher) LAS VEGAS (AP) — A small bouquet of dried flowers was wedged inside the padlock on Gate 5 of the killing ground that was the Route 91 Harvest Festival one recent day, the only visible reminder that it was the site of the worst mass shooting in modern American history. A peek inside the chain-link fence, covered in green sheeting to keep out prying eyes, revealed a sprawling patch of asphalt and little else. Towering above were the gold windows of the Mandalay Bay, where a gambler spent the last minutes of his life in room 32-135 taking the lives of 58 others in a meticulously planned slaughter. Around Las Vegas, there are scattered remembrances of the horrors of that night a year ago. Almost every week, there's another court-ordered release of police body-camera videos that provide flashbacks to the night the gunman turned the fun of the glittering Las Vegas Strip into a nightmare of death and despair. And lawsuits by MGM Resorts International to force survivors to give up their right to sue the casino company that owns Mandalay Bay opened fresh wounds over the summer. But the ""Vegas Strong"" T-shirts and car stickers have largely been put away. The original handmade white crosses for each victim have long since been taken away from the ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas"" sign to eventually reside in a museum in neighboring Henderson, though some new ones were brought in for the anniversary. There has been no closure, at least officially. Authorities say they will likely never be able to determine what it was that turned a high-limit video poker player into a mass murderer. But in a city that has always looked ahead relentlessly, there's not a lot of time devoted to reflection. Even while pausing to remember the victims on the anniversary of the shooting, Las Vegas moves forward. ""A lot of the feeling among people is more, 'Let's move on,'"" said Pauline Ng Lee, a community activist and chairwoman of the Nevada Republican Men's Club. ""We don't have a lot of long traditions here. You can see it with buildings. Casinos come up, casinos get knocked down. People tend to look forward, not back."" Indeed, a look out one side of the high windows of the Mandalay Bay shows the normal sight of dozens of tourists lined up to have their pictures taken in front of the Welcome to Las Vegas sign. A glance to the left draws the eye to the vacated and somber site of the shooting on 15 acres of valuable Las Vegas Strip land that for the foreseeable future simply cannot be used for anything. Owner MGM Resorts International has no plans for the venue and no timeline for making any decisions. Meanwhile, on the other side of the hotel, work goes on around the clock on a new $1.9 billion stadium that will be the home of the NFL's Las Vegas Raiders beginning in 2020. It's a reminder that Las Vegas moves on like it always has, through the good times and the bad. It's not that the city has forgotten the shooting or the victims. The white crosses adorned with pictures of those killed were moved recently for the anniversary to the rotunda of the Clark County government building, accompanying a heart-wrenching display of paintings of each person. The victims are portrayed as surviving relatives wanted them to be. One young woman is wearing a Philadelphia Eagles jersey; a man is strumming a guitar. There's a police officer in his uniform, and a man smiling while enjoying a day on the beach. Gathered together for one night to enjoy country music , they are now linked together in eternity. There's a makeshift memorial garden downtown, just around the corner from an adult bookstore, where painted stones and pictures hung in newly planted trees tell stories of lives lost. ""Rest easy with my grammy, Beebra,"" read the inscription on one framed picture of a smiling woman and her young children. On a recent day, a few workers were digging a hole for a 3,000-pound (1,360-kilogram) rock with the victims' initials. A permanent memorial will eventually be located elsewhere — no word from MGM on what will happen to the shooting site itself — but has yet to be planned and is likely years away. Everybody has a story about how a community came together in the wake of the shooting. Strangers loaded victims in the back of their pickup trucks and rushed them to the hospital. Doctors and nurses rushed in to try to save the wounded, and people — including players from the city's newly minted NHL team — lined up by the hundreds to donate blood. Residents dug deep into their pockets to donate to the victims and their families .

Spencer Platt / Getty Images File They said while mass school shootings get the headlines, there’s a day-in, day-out toll that adds up to even more. “While mass shootings garner significant media and social attention, unfortunately they’re not a good reflection of the actual burden of firearm-related injuries. In our study, we found that for every 100,000 teenagers and children arriving to the emergency department, 11 come for a gun-related injury,” said Dr. Faiz Gani, who worked on the study. Separately, the American College of Physicians released new guidelines calling for gun violence to be treated as a public health emergency, and backing legislation to help control gun deaths. And the group, which represents general practitioners, urged physicians to ask people whether they have guns in their homes. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha The Johns Hopkins team had set out to quantify how much it costs to treat children and teens who are injured by firearms. They used emergency room data from 2006 to 2014, covering 75,000 youths. The average hospital costs were $2,445 for emergency room visits and $44,000 if the injured child was admitted to the hospital, they found. The annual price tag: $270 million, they reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association’s JAMA Pediatrics. “Unfortunately, these numbers are likely the tip of the iceberg as we were unable to account for subsequent costs for long-term therapy/rehabilitation or expenses associated with lost work for the parents,” Gani said. The daily burden is alarming, American College of Physicians said, and updated its policy recommendations for reducing gun-related deaths. “Firearm violence continues to be a public health crisis in the United States that requires the nation's immediate attention,” the group wrote in the new guidelines, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. “The ACP is concerned about not only the alarming number of mass shootings in the United States but also the daily toll of firearm violence in neighborhoods, homes, workplaces, and public and private places across the country.” The group urged better gun regulation, including limits aimed at keeping felons and people with certain mental illnesses from getting hold of guns. “ACP supports strengthening and enforcing state and federal laws to prohibit convicted domestic violence offenders from purchasing or possessing firearms,” it added. The group also urged a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons and large capacity magazines for civilian use, as well as bans on plastic guns, including those made in 3-D printers. The American Academy of Pediatrics and American Medical Association have also called for a ban an assault weapons. “Lawmakers should carefully consider the growing but limited body of evidence that suggests the concealed-carry laws may create a greater risk of firearms injuries and deaths than any protective value they may provide,"" the ACP said. Doctors should ask patients whether they have guns at home, not as a political statement, but with the aim of keeping people safe. “The medical profession has a special responsibility to speak out on prevention of firearm-related injuries and deaths, just as physicians have spoken out on other public health issues,” the group said. “Physicians should counsel patients on the risk of having firearms in the home, particularly when children, adolescents, people with dementia, people with mental illnesses, people with substance use disorders, or others who are at increased risk of harming themselves or others are present.”",Gun control Firearm Gun The Washington Free Beacon California  Politics Gun violence Handgun,"A student at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., after a shooting there in 2012.","Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Cameron Kasky, who along with classmates David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez became one of the faces of gun control in America, said he was ready to move on from the group, but that his mind had been opened to different political perspectives in the process. ""...I met that person in Texas who got that semiautomatic weapon because that's how they like to protect their family,"" Kasky said on Fox News Radio on Wednesday. ""I met the 50-some-odd percent of women who are pro-life, even though I thought it was preposterous that a woman could be pro-life and not pro-choice at the time. ""I learned that a lot of our issues politically come from a lack of understanding of other perspectives and also the fact that so often young conservatives and young liberals will go into debate...trying to beat one another as opposed to come to an agreement."" What's the big regret? One of Kasky's most visible moments as a member of March For Our Lives was the town hall event broadcast on CNN, which was advertised as a forum to open a dialogue about gun issues and predictably devolved into emotional outbursts, finger pointing and grandstanding. Kasky found himself face-to-face with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and he gave the audience a made-for-TV moment that was rebroadcast and retweeted for days to follow. ""Senator Rubio, it's hard to look at you and not look down the barrel of an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz, but the point is you're here and there are some people who are not,"" Kasky told Rubio during the town hall, before aggressively asking the senator if he would stop taking money from the National Rifle Association. Kasky admits emotion got the best of him in that moment. ""I look back on that and I say, you know what, there were people who had just been buried and when you're looking at somebody that you find might in some way have been complicit in this murderer obtaining the weapon it's hard not to say something like that,"" Kasky said. ""But, I went into that wanting less conversation and more to embarrass Rubio and that was my biggest flaw."" Kasky said his political views haven't changed, but he wants to use his platform now to help people have more civil and productive bipartisan discussions.

In a series of interviews with the San Antonio Express-News, Danielle Kelley said her husband, Devin Kelley, behaved strangely detached that morning until he put their 2-year-old son in the bedroom and forced her into the bedroom, where he bound her to the bed using rope, handcuffs and tape as their son cried. She said Devin told her he loved her, kissed their 5-month-old daughter in her crib and told their son, ""I'll be right back."" He grabbed his rifle and two handguns, donned military-style tactical gear and body armor, then left. Devin Kelley then went to First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs and killed 25 people, more than half of whom were children. Authorities put the official death toll at 26 because one of the victims was pregnant. Danielle still uses her husband's surname, saying she's ""not going to be ashamed"" of it. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Her adoptive mother, Michelle Shields, has said her son-in-law was controlling and abusive to her daughter, who often accepted the abuse. ""We all have our demons,"" Danielle said. Danielle and Devin met when she was 13 and he was 17. Both came from unstable backgrounds. Danielle said her biological parents had abused her before Child Protective Services removed her and Michelle Shields adopted her as a 4-year-old. She said Devin told her about being bullied as a child. After he joined the Air Force and married another woman, they corresponded through letters. He was court-martialed for fracturing his stepson's skull, served time behind bars, was kicked out of the military and divorced. Devin's ex-wife, Tessa Brennaman, said in November that she lived in constant fear of him. ""He just had a lot of demons or hatred inside of him,"" she told ""Inside Edition."" Devin and Danielle married in April 2014, when he was 23 and she was 19. She said he went with her everywhere. ""It was frustrating. But you would be surprised, when everything's gone, how much I miss it,"" she said. Six months before the massacre, while living in Sutherland Springs, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) southeast of San Antonio, Devin grew more depressed, his temper grew shorter, and he grew less tolerant, she said. ""He was shutting down,"" Danielle said. In April 2016, he bought an assault-style rifle and gathered more than a dozen magazines capable of holding 30 rounds of ammunition each. He grew more reclusive. When she persuaded him to attend church services, including at First Baptist, he would laugh during sermons. He became an atheist. ""Devin was sick. He lost who he was. Because the real Devin would've never hurt babies. He was a family person. He would never have hurt anybody. He lost touch of reality,"" Danielle said. After the shooting, he called his parents and told them to go to his house. He later frantically phoned Danielle, who put the call on speakerphone for his parents, who had untied her. ""I just shot up the Sutherland Springs church,"" he said. They pleaded with him to stop. ""He was like 'I can't. I've killed so many people - so, so many people,'"" Danielle said. ""He kept saying how sorry he was."" He told them he wasn't going to make it home, that he loved them. They told him the same. Then the call ended. After the shooting in November, officials said there had been a ""domestic situation"" between the shooter and his mother-in-law before the massacre in which the suspect had sent the woman threatening texts.

In the past, the NRA has advertised that its members could enjoy discounted deals from companies like Avis Budget Group, Best Western, United Airlines, MetLife and Wyndham Worldwide. But since Thursday, those companies and several others have announced they have ended or will soon end their corporate partnerships with the gun group. The announcements come in the wake of the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14 and as much of the public has buffeted the NRA and called for stricter gun regulations. The corporate exodus, however, isn't over these companies' values or their positions on gun regulations, according to William Klepper, a professor at professor at the Columbia Business School—it's simply about prudence. Trending: Stephen Colbert Mocks Donald Trump for Saying He Would Run Into School Shooting: 'I Really Don't Believe He Can Run' Related: Here's why the NRA is so powerful and why gun control advocates have reason for hope ""Is it ideological?"" Klepper said to Newsweek. ""I think it's flat out good business on their behalf."" GettyImages-158618379 More Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images ""We've reached a tipping point with regard to this issue [of gun control] in the general society and companies that are worth their salt—and CEOs specifically—are constantly trying to read the tea leaves,"" Klepper said. ""They're not operating in a vacuum; they've gotten the reaction from the constituents. And, in most cases, their constituents are their customers."" Don't miss: Lathmar Holi Photos: Women Beat Men with Sticks in Hindu Festival of Color Klepper said businesses are quicker to cross the NRA because their clients far outnumber the NRA's purported membership of 5 million. ""It's an impressive number when you throw it out, but now you've got to put in context,"" he said. For context, TrueCar.com, an online car-buying service that announced its discount deal with the NRA would end on February 28, had nearly 10 million visitors to its website last month, according to SimilarWeb.com, which tracks Internet traffic. ""Really, the principled voice that we're hearing is not from the government, it's from businesses. That's because they respond immediately to the voice of the people,"" Klepper said, adding, ""that's what good businesses do."" Historically, the NRA's membership has been significantly more politically active and easily mobilized. That, as well as its significant lobbying arm, has often been credited with blocking gun reforms and bringing to heel politicians who benefit from NRA money and are reluctant to cross the group's vocal base.

In 2016, gun-rights groups called for Democrats to bar all armed security at the Democratic National Convention. ""Gun owners are demanding that the Democratic party practice what it preaches,"" read a petition from the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. ""If a political party believes that guns do not make us safer, they should set an example by rejecting any and all forms of armed security at their convention."" Similar attacks have been used against celebrities who have called for tighter gun controls while enjoying protection by armed security. It has been noted, though, that the likes of Sanders, and others calling for stronger legislation, have never called for firearms to be taken away from trained professionals, but rather to expand background checks to ensure they don't get into the wrong hands. Sanders, however, has a murky history on gun control legislation, something that was used by Hillary Clinton to attack him during the 2016 Democratic primary.

A ... threat? Yes. A threat. According to WTVF-TV, at least four Nashville-area gay bars received the flyers, and some people are calling the content of the flyers ""targeted hate mail."" Melvin Brown, the owner of Nashville's Stirrup, said that his establishment was one that received the offending postcard-style mailer. The postcard, as you can see above, follows a red, white, and blue theme and features the letters ""LGBT,"" which, in this case, appear to stand for ""Liberty,"" ""Guns,"" ""Beer,"" and ""Trump."" Brown said that the photo of the gun was especially chilling. ""When you put a picture of an assault rifle on there — which was used in the Pulse shooting — and you mail it to every LGBT bar in Nashville, that is coming from a hateful place,"" Brown said. ""To say that it's disturbing is an understatement."" Brown was referring to the 2016 mass killing of at least 49 victims at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The postcard's front has a ""MAGA"" stamp on it and a return address that locates to an empty Nashville lot. Brown said that he feels the flyers are tied to the upcoming midterm elections, although the mailer does not appear to affiliate itself with a particular political party or a candidate. ""The midterms are right around the corner and I think somebody is trying to incite a reaction,"" Brown explained. Anything else? Brown also spoke to NBC News, where he expounded on his feelings that the ""disturbing"" mailer was sent for a reason. “We live in a post-Pulse world in the LGBTQ community, especially in the bar scene,” Brown explained. “To see somebody send a postcard that had a picture of the weapon used in one of the deadliest assaults in this nation’s history, and one that happened at an LGBTQ bar, and to send that image to LGBTQ bars, to me is not a coincidence.” Chris Sanders, who is executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, said the mailers were sent to intimidate, and suggested that the mailers could be politically motivated, since some gay bars in the area host voter registration drives. “This has a very aggressive tone about it,” Sanders warned. “It doesn’t use many words, but it uses a lot of images I think are meant to threaten us. The community's message back is, ‘Yes this is frightening, but we’re going to turn out and vote regardless.’” A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said that while the department is aware of the incident, there is no open investigation at the time of this writing. The spokesperson noted that extra officers were dispatched to patrol the areas in which gay bars are located.

The targeted locations are in Parkland, Fla.; Las Vegas; Denver; Minneapolis; Irvine, Calif., Milwaukee; Houston; Sarasota, Fla.; Spokane, Wash.; and Philadelphia, according to the website of Giffords Courage, a gun-control group.

One design in the project, callled ""The Last Loockdown,"" shows a terrified girl huddled underneath a desk, the Washington Post reported. ""I know my son -- he was a cool dude -- and I know he would think this statue is a really powerful way to get our message across,"" Oliver told the paper. The statues are part of a nationwide voter registration drive to urge voters to elect candidates who back gun-control measures, the report said. Giffords Courage is teaming up with the student leaders, the paper reported, citing the organization's news release. ""I am proud of [young people] for making it clear to the gun lobby and the NRA that we will no longer tolerate a world where politicians vote against the public safety of the communities they represent,"" Gabrielle Giffords, co-founder of Giffords Courage, said, according to the Chronicle. Giffords, a former congresswoman from Arizona, survived an assassination attempt in 2011.

""Anyone who wants these files is going to get them. I'm gonna sell it to them, I'm gonna ship them. That began this morning,"" Wilson said. ""That will never be interrupted. The free exchange of these ideas will never be interrupted."" Wilson spoke a day after a federal judge in Seattle granted a motion for a preliminary injunction that blocked him from releasing downloadable blueprints for 3D-printed guns until the litigation is resolved. Critics say the blueprints will make it easier for felons, minors and mentally ill people to potentially make their own 3D-printed guns, which they fear can be made to be untraceable. But Wilson says that the ""hysterical"" court order limited his free speech rights. The ruling came as part of a years-long battle between the federal government and Defense Distributed, an Austin, Texas-based organization that in 2013 first posted designs for a 3D-printed handgun called the Liberator. The pistol was made out of ABS plastic, the same material used in Lego blocks, and could be made on a 3D printer. The US government ordered the blueprints be taken down that year, and Wilson sued the government in 2015. The Trump administration settled the case in June, and the 3D weapon blueprints were scheduled to be posted online August 1. However, Washington state and other states sued to block the release of the blueprints that day. Judge Robert Lasnik sided with the states and temporarily blocked the settlement, although more than 1,000 people downloaded the designs before the judge's decision. Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, is selling blueprints of 3D-printed guns despite a federal court order, he said on Tuesday, August 28, 2018. At times brash and smug, Wilson pointed to one line in Judge Lasnik's decision that he said allowed him to legally sell the blueprints. ""Regulation under the (Arms Export Control Act of 1976) means that the files cannot be uploaded to the internet, but they can be emailed, mailed, securely transmitted, or otherwise published within the United States,"" the court order reads. Wilson, an open-source advocate, said he preferred to give the blueprints away for free but decided to sell them instead, comparing his decision to the downloadable music industry. ""I'm happy now to become the iTunes of downloadable guns if I can't become the Napster."" Further, he said his company would be fine, and he portrayed his inability to post gun blueprints online as a violation of free speech. ""All that's happened here because of this judge's order is perhaps the doubling or tripling of the valuation of my own company,"" he said. ""Really what's at stake in the courts is simply the government's power to tell you what you can or can't have or can and can't download online.""",3D printed firearms 3D printing Gun Defense Distributed Firearm Liberator Victoria and Albert Museum United States Printing,A 3D-printed gun that the company has been sold.,"(CNN) The owner of a company that builds 3D-printed guns said he has begun selling blueprints of the weapons to elude a court order on Monday that banned him from giving the plans away for free.

As gun violence, sexual assault claims and immigration dominate the 2018 news cycle, the American Psychological Association's annual Stress in America survey says that such issues are the main cause of stress among young adults. The survey, released Tuesday, was conducted among 3,459 people 18 and older, and it included interviews with 300 teenagers ages 15 to 17. It measures attitudes and perception of stress to identify the leading sources of stress among the general public. School safety is a top concern Gun violence is the top source of stress across all generations, the survey said. About 75% of Gen Z reported mass shootings as a significant source of stress, and 72% said the same about school shootings. school say they experience stress when considering the possibility of a school shooting, About 56% of those who are inschool say they experience stress when considering the possibility of a school shooting, the survey says. School shootings are also a top concern for parents, the survey says, as 74% fear one or the possibility of one. In comparison, 73% of millennials who took the survey stress about school shootings and 69% about mass shootings. As for Gen Xers and baby boomers, 58% expressed concern over mass shootings, and about the same percentage stress over school shootings. School security measures have helped reduce stress levels in 37% of students interviewed, but 22% feel that the measures have increased their stress levels; 41% say that they have not affected their stress levels, the report adds. ""The pressures facing Generation Z are different from those that faced older generations at the same age. For example, mass shootings simply did not happen with the same scale and frequency when I was in school,"" said Arthur Evans, a psychologist and CEO of the American Psychological Association. This is the 12th year the association has conducted the stress survey as part of its Mind/Body Health Campaign, and it's the first year the survey has asked about gun violence, spokeswoman Sophie Bethune said. Stressed about the country In order to direct the association's focus on Gen Z, Evans said, it added questions on a range of issues such as immigration, climate change, rising suicide rates and reports of sexual harassment or abuse. Sixty-eight percent of people between the ages 18 and 21 expressed concern for the state of the nation, but the study found this generation to be least likely to run to the polls in November, with just 54% saying they will vote. The survey says that number is well below the overall average of 7 in 10 adults from all generations who plan to vote in the 2018 midterm elections. Still, 57% of Gen Z believed the cases of separation and deportation of immigrant families in the United States to be a significant source of stress, in comparison to 45% of adults overall. Widespread reports of sexual harassment or abuse have also played a big role in the young adults' stress levels, as 53% blamed this issue for their stress. Only 39% of adults overall say the same. As for climate change, 58% of Gen Z says it's a significant source of stress, in comparison with 51% of adults overall. Evans attributes these results to the fact that certain regions of a young adult's brain are still maturing and have not developed enough to handle stress the same way adults do. ""While young people are facing many of the same issues that older adults face, they have not yet had the life experiences that many older adults have had, such as practice responding to and coping with a broad range of stressors,"" he said. Reporting a mental problem Although 62% of Generation Z said rising suicide rates are also a source of stress, compared with 44% of adults overall, the survey says these young people are more likely to report mental health conditions than any other generation. About 37% of young adults reported receiving help or treatment from mental health professionals, and half feel that they do enough to manage their stress. Only 35% of millennials, 26% of Gen Xers and 22% of baby boomers reported to receiving help, treatment or therapy for mental health. ""The fact that more Gen Z individuals than adults in other generations said that they thought their mental health was fair or poor is concerning,"" Evans said. ""However, this could also be interpreted as a positive sign. This generation may be more tuned in to recognizing issues with their mental health than older generations."" The report says that public figures' openness about their mental health challenges could be a reason why this generation is speaking out more, and their use of social media could be another key factor. ""It's clear that social media is an enormous part of Gen Zs' lives, and for more than half of them (55%), it provides a feeling of support,"" the report says. But social media also plays a negative role, the report claims; 45% said they feel judged on the social platforms, and 38% reported feeling bad about themselves due to the use of social media. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. One positive outcome in the report was that 75% of the overall participants said they feel hopeful about their future.

On Friday, National Rifle Association spokeswoman Dana Loesch referenced the 1920s mob boss in an attempt to defend the president and ― spoiler alert! ― it was kind of bizarre. Speaking on the group’s streaming platform NRATV on Friday, Loesch attempted to say Trump’s alleged infidelities are the reason he’s facing legal battles, but that Democrats are using campaign finance laws as an excuse to go after him. “The moral argument over the president’s infidelities would never result in legal trouble. So they believe they have to take a lesson from the Clinton years and find a way to make it a legal problem,” she said in a video saved by the progressive media watchdog Media Matters. “And that’s exactly what they’re using campaign finance for, an already unconstitutional set of laws to pull it off.” Then Loesch decided that if Trump could use an Al Capone analogy, she could too, but she went one step further and turned the mob boss’ name into a verb. They’re trying to Al Capone the president. I mean, you remember, Capone didn’t go down for murder. Eliot Ness didn’t put him in for murder. He went in for tax fraud. Prosecutors didn’t care how he went down as long as he went down. The same goes for Democrats. Whatever avenue is needed to bring down the president, they’ll take it. RawStory pointed out that Loesch’s attempt to blame Trump’s potential legal troubles on the Democrats had serious flaws: It should be noted here that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a Republican. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a Republican, appointed by a Republican president, confirmed by a Republican Senate. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is a Republican, appointed by a Republican president, confirmed by a Republican Senate. FBI Director Christopher Wray is a Republican, appointed by a Republican president, confirmed by a Republican Senate. Story continues Here’s the whole Loesch segment, courtesy of Media Matters: Some Twitter users wondered why Loesch was comparing Trump to a noted gangster. So, she thinks Al was a good guy & not deserving of prosecution by any means necessary?

Conway appeared on Fox & Friends, blaming “anti-religiosity” for Saturday’s attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue, which killed 11 people. The senior White House counselor to President Trump also called out “late-night comedians” for perpetuating such sentiment. “The anti-religiosity in this country, that is somehow in vogue and funny to make fun of anybody of faith, to constantly be making fun of people who express religion, the late-night comedians, the unfunny people on TV shows, it’s always anti-religious,” Conway said on the Fox News morning show. She continued, “And, remember, these people were gunned down in their place of worship, as were the people in South Carolina several years ago.” Conway was referencing the mass shooting at a black church in Charleston, S.C., carried out by white supremacist Dylann Roof. He was convicted and sentenced to death for murdering nine people in the 2015 incident. “And they were there because they’re people of faith, and it’s faith that needs to bring us together,” stated Conway. “This is no time to be driving God out of the public square. No time to be making fun of people.” The Pittsburgh shooting marked the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. Federal prosecutors have filed hate-crime charges against Robert Bowers, a 46-year-old white man who surrendered to authorities after Saturday morning’s shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue. Law enforcement officials told CNN that he had made anti-Semitic statements during the shooting and targeted Jews on social media. Although Conway failed to discuss the growing issue of anti-Semitism in the United States, she praised President Trump for using such a phrase.

Now a Los Angeles councilman is trying to make it a misdemeanor to download those blueprints. Under a proposal introduced Friday by Los Angeles City Councilman Mitch Englander, Angelenos could be barred from possessing or transferring the blueprints for a 3-D-printed gun, as well as the weapons themselves. Englander also wants L.A. to prod the state to make possessing such guns or blueprints a felony across California. Englander told reporters he was worried that as 3-D printing technology evolves and becomes more widely accessible, “you can go to the store tomorrow, buy a 3-D printer, and have a gun printed at home today — no waiting period, no serial number. Advertisement “That’s very dangerous to society,” the councilman said. Critics fear that access to such blueprints will ease the way for people to make firearms that lack serial numbers, skirting licensing requirements and making them untraceable to police. Such guns are typically made of hard plastic, raising concerns that they could be carried through metal detectors and onto planes. Some gun rights advocates have countered that citizens should have the freedom to access the blueprints. “Why wouldn’t the Second Amendment protect the right of a law-abiding citizen to make his or her own weapons?” Erich Pratt, executive director of Gun Owners of America, said in a statement earlier this week. Gun rights groups have also stressed that undetectable weapons already are targeted by existing laws. Chris W. Cox, executive director of the National Rifle Assn. Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement Tuesday that “regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years.” Advertisement Englander said that people have gotten around a California law requiring a stainless steel component in such guns by making the metal piece a removable, “non-essential” component. He argued that by targeting the digital files to make such guns, his proposal would give law enforcement a new tool to try to prevent their spread. The debate has been thrust into the headlines by a legal battle involving Austin, Texas, resident Cody Wilson, founder of digital firearm blueprint developer Defense Distributed, who reached a settlement with the U.S. Justice Department allowing him to put the blueprints online. Earlier this week, a federal judge issued an order to temporarily stop the public from accessing the files, in reaction to a lawsuit from the attorneys general of multiple states. California Atty. Gen. Xavier Becerra announced Thursday that the state was joining that suit, led by Washington state, to block the release of the files. “Why would anyone increase the burden on law enforcement and sabotage its ability to keep American communities safe?” Becerra said in a statement. Advertisement It is already possible to construct a gun at home, even without an expensive 3-D printer. Los Angeles authorities say that as it becomes harder to get firearms, gangs increasingly are turning to homemade guns built from parts purchased over the internet, dubbed “ghost guns” because they lack serial numbers. Becerra cautioned Californians this week that if they make their own guns, they must be eligible to legally own or possess a firearm, include design features required under state law, and apply to the California Department of Justice for a unique firearm serial number and place it on the weapon. Englander said Friday that while it already is possible to make a gun at home, he was concerned that as technology makes it easier, “people may just do it to see if it works,” regardless of their age, criminal history or mental health — and without following those state rules. Chuck Michel, president and general counsel of the California Rifle & Pistol Assn., derided that idea. Advertisement “An incredible amount of disinformation is being used to justify this kind of hysterical overreaction,” Michel said in an email reacting to the new proposal. Guns made of printed parts are “crude, unreliable, and short-lived. Bad guys are better off continuing to steal guns, or make equally crude firearms with parts from Home Depot.” The Los Angeles City Council has backed gun control measures in the past, including requiring Angelenos to lock up or disable their handguns at home if the guns aren’t close at hand. In March, Councilman Mitch O’Farrell said he wanted the city to cut ties with companies that are linked to the NRA, a proposal that has yet to move forward.

Phil Bredesen in his run for a U.S. Senate seat referred to “white male” gun owners as ""Murican gun nuts"" in response to a Facebook post asking people to identify “the biggest terrorist organization on the planet,” according to a report. Mark Brown, communications director for Tennessee Victory 2018, a group backing Bredesen's run against Republican U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn for the Senate seat occupied by retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker, posted the comment in 2015, the Washington Free Beacon reported. Brown's comment attracted zero likes, according to the report. It was not the first time Brown made incendiary comments about Republicans. TOP TENNESSEE DEM PARTY OFFICIAL SNUBS ‘REACHING OUT’ TO TRUMP VOTERS, CALLS THEM ‘IDIOTS’ In a July 31, 2017 post, Brown allegedly wrote, “Exactly, f--- “reaching out” to Trump voters. The idiots aren’t listening.” In other posts, he has referred to President Trump as “Putin’s b---h,” “racist,” a “f---stik,” an “insane f---,” and a “F---ing moron.” Brown’s brazen approach is at odds with Bredesen, who has painted himself as a moderate willing to reach across the aisle. Bredesen broke with his party during the controversy surrounding Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexual assault during his Senate confirmation hearings. In a TV interview, Bredesen said he would have supported Kavanaugh’s nomination if he were a senator because the allegations lacked sufficient evidence. TAYLOR SWIFT SUPPORTS DEMOCRAT WHO BROKE FROM PARTY ON KAVANAUGH IN RARE POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT Those comments lost him the support of two prominent Democratic groups, MoveOn and Priorities USA. But Bredesen has attracted the support of pop singer Taylor Swift, who sharply criticized the GOP's Blackburn in an online post that preceded a sharp rise in voter registrations in the state. However, a new New York Times poll on Friday showed Blackburn leading Bredesen by 14 points. In a recent campaign ad, the former governor referred to himself as a “lifelong gun owner” and a supporter of Second Amendment gun rights. “As governor, I had an A rating from the NRA,” Bredesen said. But the National Rifle Association called Bredesen’s ad “false” and “misleading.” “Phil Bredesen is a ‘D’ rated candidate, and he will not protect our constitutional rights in Washington, D.C.,” said Chris W. Cox, chairman of the NRA’s Political Victory Fund, in a statement. Bredesen has not publicly addressed Brown’s comments. In recent weeks the Senate candidate appeared at fundraiser that headlined ex-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a staunch supporter of gun control. Earlier in the campaign, Bredesen denounced Vice President Mike Pence’s “name-calling” because he endorsed Blackburn, and called him a “liberal.” On Wednesday, Bredesen and Blackburn exchanged barbs in their second and final debate ahead of the November midterms. The outcome of the competitive red-state has attracted nationwide attention due to a 51-49 Republican majority at stake.

37,37,90014,https://www.yahoo.com/news/cruz-biological-mothers-past-factor-school-shooting-165703886.html,Cruz biological mother's past a factor in school shooting,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The extensive criminal and drug abuse history of Parkland school suspect Nikolas Cruz's biological mother could be a key factor in whether he is sentenced to die for the massacre that killed 17 people, legal experts and officials say. The mother, 62-year-old Brenda Woodard, played no role in Cruz's upbringing after giving him up for adoption after he was born. But her past, which included a crack cocaine purchase arrest while she was pregnant with Cruz, will almost certainly be brought up for a jury considering whether he should live or die. ""It is not necessarily her past, but how her past contributed to his genetic makeup,"" said David S. Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor now in private practice. ""Her use of drugs and alcohol while she was pregnant with him, and how her genetic makeup was passed on to him."" ""It might not carry the day, but it will give the jurors another mitigating factor to consider,"" he added. The identity of Woodard, first reported Wednesday by the Miami Herald, was confirmed to the Associated Press by a person close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is an ongoing prosecution. The American Bar Association guidelines for defense lawyers in death penalty cases say they should closely examine all the defendant's past family, going back at least three generations. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, the chairman of a state commission investigating the shooting separate from the prosecution, said Wednesday that all of Cruz's background is relevant. ""If information has come to light about his biological mother and there is some relevance there, of course we will take a look at it,"" Gualtieri said. ""We are looking heavily at his background and his whole life."" Cruz, 19, is charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. His lawyers say he will plead guilty if spared the death penalty, but prosecutors have refused that offer. Story continues Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein declined Wednesday to discuss how Woodard's past might become part of the case. But he repeated that Cruz is ready to end it now. ""Lock him up forever. Throw away the key and never speak his name,"" Finkelstein said in an email. ""Maybe it will curtail some of the pain and hurt that certainly will happen if this case continues on a decades-long march to death."" If the case goes to the death penalty phase, all 12 jurors must agree on capital punishment or Cruz will get an automatic life prison sentence. Cruz and his brother, Zachary, were both adopted by Roger and Lynda Cruz soon after Woodard gave birth to them. Roger Cruz died when Nikolas Cruz was a young child and Lynda Cruz died last November, just a few months before the Parkland shooting. Nikolas Cruz had numerous behavioral and learning problems throughout his life, along with a fascination with guns and his own problems with alcohol and drug abuse. Court and prison records show that Woodard was arrested more than two dozen times from the 1980s through the 2000s for crimes including drug offenses, car theft, weapons possession, burglary, domestic violence and battery charges. She served a variety of prison sentences over those decades, including one 18-month stretch for car theft and fleeing from a law enforcement officer. Woodard was charged in 2010 with using a tire iron to beat someone she shared an apartment with in a senior living complex. Her last arrest was in 2011, records show. Woodard did not immediately respond Wednesday to a message left on her cellphone. Cruz's half-sister and Woodard's daughter, Danielle Woodard, has had her own extensive brushes with the law and is currently imprisoned as a habitual offender, Corrections Department records show. Her most recent convictions include attempted second-degree murder, cocaine possession, battery on and fleeing from a law enforcement officer and credit card fraud. She is scheduled for release in 2020. _____ Associated Press writer Terry Spencer in Sunrise, Florida, contributed to this story. _____ Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt",Nikolas Cruz Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Parkland Fort Lauderdale School shooting Shooting Suspect Broward County Sheriff's Office School Murder,"Nikolas Cruz in court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in February.","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

Two of the school’s highest-profile activists, David Hogg and Emma González, have become the focus of a particularly troll-like strain of pro-gun anger and this week were likened to Nazis, Communists, and anti-American traitors.

Radicals on Twitter were accusing the students of being actors even as news reports of the Feb. 14 shooting were still coming in, and conspiracy-theory king Alex Jones quickly spread these falsehoods further—despite eventual pushback from internet platforms. Fast-forward a month, and we began to see fabricated attacks like this viral GIF altered to show Emma González appearing to tear up the U.S. Constitution, which caught on during the March for Our Lives. At its peak, it was shared by actor Adam Baldwin, who in the caption of the now-deleted tweet compared her to a member of the Hitler Youth. (In the real video, published by Teen Vogue, González tore up a gun-range target.) Hogg, meanwhile, has been repeatedly smeared in memes likening him to Adolf Hitler. All in favor of Gun Control raise your right arm! pic.twitter.com/B9LmDMQzph — Eddie B. #Trump2020 (@edbenson98) March 28, 2018 In notable instances of prominent people making bizarre critiques of the Parkland students, Iowa Rep. Steve King’s campaign Facebook page mocked González for wearing a Cuba flag patch on her jacket. “This is how you look when you claim Cuban heritage yet don’t speak Spanish and ignore the fact that your ancestors fled the island when the dictatorship turned Cuba into a prison camp, after removing all weapons from its citizens,” the Facebook post read. “[H]ence their right to self defense.” The campaign team then defended itself by saying the “meme in question” was “obviously” not an attack on González’s heritage but “merely points out the irony of someone pushing gun control while wearing the flag of a country that was oppressed by a communist, anti-gun regime.” (It also seemed to say that González should speak Spanish, despite the fact that King has said before that “Assimilation, not diversity, is our American strength.” Also, the Cuban flag predates Castro’s regime.) King might be the most prominent politician to attack the Parkland students individually, but he isn’t the only one. As a testimony to the pervasive influence of conspiracy-mongering pro-gun conservatives online, local political figures have given in to liking, sharing, and echoing arguments untethered to facts but strong in conviction, intended only to undermine the efforts of these teenage victims. Or, feeding off partisan anger, they have simply resorted to insults. Here are more examples of such attacks from political figures: Benjamin Kelly, Aide to Florida State Rep. Shawn Harrison On Feb. 20, Ben Kelly emailed a Tampa Bay Times reporter, unsolicited, with a then-shocking statement about Hogg and González. “Both kids in the picture are not students here but actors that travel to various crisis when they happen,” he said in the email. When the Times asked for evidence supporting his claim, Kelly sent an email, still from his official government account, linking to a conspiracy video showing Hogg in a news clip in California as evidence he was a crisis actor. “There is a clip on you tube that shows Mr. Hogg out in California,” Kelly wrote. “(I guess he transferred?)” Harrison told a reporter that Kelly should not have sent the email. He then said he placed Kelly on leave and that Kelly shared the statement “without my knowledge.” Kelly was then fired by state House Speaker Richard Corcoran. The day before, on his personal Twitter account, according to the Times, Kelly liked a tweet calling González a “brown bald lesbian girl.” Leslie Gibson, Republican Candidate for the Maine State House Just over two weeks ago, when Gibson was running unopposed for the seat, he said in a since-deleted tweet that “There is nothing about this skinhead lesbian that impresses me and there is nothing that she has to say unless you’re a frothing at the mouth moonbat.” The tweet was referring to González, who is openly bisexual and who has a buzz cut. He also called Hogg a “moron” and a “baldfaced liar.” In the outrage that ensued, some state legislators condemned his comments, and Hogg took to Twitter to ask people to run against Gibson. Two challengers surfaced just days later, and Gibson withdrew from the race. “I am walking away with my head held high,” he said. Anthony Testaverde, Longtime Aide to New York State Sen. Martin Golden On Saturday, Testaverde shared on Facebook a photo of Hogg holding his right fist in the air at the March for Our Lives demonstration. Next to it was a historical photo of Hitler saluting. Below, an image of Hogg wearing a black mourning band was compared to a photo of a Nazi swastika armband. “I knew something was off about this kid,” the post declares. The comparison of the Parkland activists and other gun control advocates to Nazis cites a historically flawed argument that has long persisted in pro-gun circles about the Third Reich taking away German citizens’ guns, preventing effective resistance. “The Democrats are doing exactly what Hitler did,” Testaverde wrote in another post. “He used the youth to disarm and control the people. This is scary!” Sen. Golden faced loud criticism for the actions of his aide, and he publicly condemned Testaverde’s posts as “offensive” and “misguided” but refused to say he would fire him. On Tuesday, Testaverde was fired. Mary Franson, Minnesota State Representative On Saturday night, Franson shared a Facebook post that referred to Hogg as “Supreme Leader.” She then shared a quote, via the conservative site the Daily Wire, from the March for Our Lives speech by Delaney Tarr, a 17-year-old Parkland survivor, who said, “When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile!” Franson’s commentary above that quote was “And there you have it friends … the anti gunners, the high school students who speak for all, aren’t interested in an ‘inch’. They want the mile. They want your guns. Gone.” The kicker, though, came about 15 minutes later when she posted a link from the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum website titled, “Shaping the Future: Indoctrinating Youth.” Above, she quoted Hitler talking about indoctrination. Later, as she faced criticism over linking Parkland survivors to Nazi youths, she argued that the indoctrination post was unrelated to her earlier posts and denounced the media for making the connection. If more proof was needed that insults and conspiracy theories have mainstream power, Donald Trump Jr. liked two tweets attacking Hogg. In one, conservative TV host Graham Ledger linked an article from Gateway Pundit and suggested Hogg, whose father is a former FBI agent, was “running cover” for his father because the FBI “botched” tracking down the shooter. Trump Jr. liked another tweet peddling the same conspiracy with a post from a far-right website about the “Outspoken Trump-Hating School Shooting Survivor” that doubted Hogg was an actual victim and blamed the “Deep State media” for giving him a platform. Given that the Parkland student-activists are still working to encourage more town hall events and more demonstrations, it seems likely these teenagers will face evermore vile personal and public attacks in the months to come. Although we cannot expect any personal responsibility from internet trolls, Americans should expect better from public officials, who have the power to lend legitimacy to the more disgraceful arguments circling around social media.

I won't shoot you. Whites don't shoot whites,"" the Courier-Journal newspaper reported Thursday. Gregory Alan Bush, 51, was arrested moments after the shooting and was ordered jailed on $5 million bond Thursday on two counts of murder and 10 counts of wanton endangerment. Jeffersontown Police Chief Sam Rogers told reporters at an initial news conference Wednesday that authorities ""have no idea"" what motivated the shootings. The FBI said in a statement that it is ""evaluating the evidence to determine if there were any violations of federal law."" According to a police report, Bush walked into the store, pulled a gun from his waist and shot a man in the back of the head. The report says Bush then shot the man ""multiple times ""as he was down on the floor."" The report says Bush then reholstered his gun, walked outside and killed a woman in the parking lot. Witness Ed Harrell told the Courier-Journal that he was waiting for his wife in the lot when he heard gunshots and grabbed his revolver. As he crouched down, Harrell said he saw the gunman walk ""nonchalantly"" by with a gun by his side. Harrell said he called out to ask what was going on, and the gunman replied: ""Don't shoot me. I won't shoot you. Whites don't shoot whites."" Bystander video shows a white man in a distinctive neon-yellow shirt trying to drive away while an officer chases after him on foot. The victims were identified as Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vicki Lee Jones, 67. Stallard is the father of Kellie Watson, the chief racial equity officer for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. The mayor shared his outrage Thursday over what he called an ""epidemic of gun violence"" that ""hit close to home."" ""Somehow, a few have become so beholden to politics that they place a higher value on that than on the lives of our fellow Americans,"" said Fischer, a Democrat running for re-election. ""People getting shot at a grocery store, a school, outside a church. Can't we all agree that that is unacceptable?"" Fischer said at a news conference. Bush's criminal record shows he threatened his ex-wife and punched a deputy sheriff during a family court hearing years ago. An arrest record from May 2009 says Bush became ""irate"" and shouted obscenities and threats at his ex-wife. When deputies tried to subdue him, he fought off attempts to handcuff him and he punched a deputy twice. He was charged with several counts, including assault, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct. Bush also was marked as a ""suicide risk"" on the arrest sheet, which noted that his ex-wife had a protective order against him. In a 2003 incident, Bush was charged with menacing for following a 15-year-old into a movie theater bathroom and putting his hands around her waist. Bush told the girl he ""thought we were family"" and the girl pushed him away, according to the arrest record. Bush's attack on customers caused chaos at the Kroger. Eric Deacon, who identified himself as an emergency medical technician, told The Associated Press that he was in the store's self-checkout lane when he heard the first shot, in the pharmacy area. He said a man came around the corner and ""the look on his face, he looked like he just didn't care."" Deacon said he saw another man in the store with a gun who appeared to be shooting at the suspect. Then Deacon went outside and saw a woman in her mid-50s or early 60s who had been hit, and tried to resuscitate her. ""She was gone, there's nothing I could do,"" Deacon said. ""I think she just got caught in the crossfire."" Fischer said he's ""just sick and heartbroken and quite angry."" Louisville has created violence-prevention programs, and has more to do, he said. ""But at the city level, there's only so much that we can do. Because the hard fact is, that most violent crimes are committed with guns. And guns fall under the jurisdiction of the state and federal governments. And every time someone takes a gun and creates a tragedy, what's the response from too many of our leaders? The ones that have the power to make our country safer? ... They act as if nothing can be done. That doesn't sound like the United States of America to me.""

Phil Murphy (D) on Monday introduced a variety of measures aimed at strengthening the state's gun laws, a move that came just days after a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh-area synagogue left 11 people dead. “No matter how strong we think our gun laws are, we must always look to close loopholes that escaped our prior efforts,” Murphy said at a news conference in Trenton, N.J., according to The Wall Street Journal. ADVERTISEMENT Murphy said he would work with the legislature and the state attorney general’s office to pass measures that would prevent individuals who aren't allowed to purchase firearms from buying ammunition and to require purchasers to show a photo identification when buying ammunition. Murphy's announcement came after a shooter opened fire at the Pittsburgh-area Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday, leaving 11 dead and six others wounded. The Journal notes that Murphy is also proposing a $15 million grant program that would support violence-intervention efforts in certain parts of New Jersey. The program would be funded by private, federal and state money. Murphy's statement comes months after he signed six bills to tighten the state's gun control laws. At the time, Murphy said the laws would honor the victims of the Pulse night club shooting in Orlando, Fla. The measures included requirements for background checks on private gun sales, the reduction of magazine capacity, a ban on armor-piercing bullets, and keeping “guns out of the wrong hands.” State Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D) told the Journal that he hoped the new proposals would pass the legislature within three months. Robert Bowers, 46, has been charged in connection with Saturday's shooting, which has been dubbed the deadliest attack against Jews in American history by the Anti-Defamation League.

John. R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and the author of the new study, has always been skeptical of the research by Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama, whose work gained special prominence after then-President Barack Obama cited his study in remarks about the San Bernardino attack in December 2015. Lott raised alarm bells that Lankford, who found that between 1966 and 2012 the U.S. had 31 percent of public mass shooters in the world despite accounting for less than five percent of the population, did not do diligent research and refused to be transparent about his work, including not sharing his paper with others as he started his media blitz tour promoting the study in 2015. US GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES EXAGGERATE BENEFITS OF AUSTRALIA'S GUN RESTRICTIONS ""Here’s an amazing thing, [Lankford] refuses to provide his list of cases, he refuses to explain exactly how he got it. This is not just some normal academic study – President Obama many times cited this study as a source for his claims."" — John. R. Lott Jr. “Here’s an amazing thing, [Lankford] refuses to provide his list of cases, he refuses to explain exactly how he got it. This is not just some normal academic study – President Obama many times cited this study as a source for his claims. I can’t find any other academic research that’s gotten so much worldwide attention,” Lott told Fox News, adding that people across the world heard about the study. Despite that, the study became go-to research across the media, with the New York Times and CNN frequently citing it. Just this Wednesday, liberal news site Vox referenced a CNN article that cited Lankford’s work. Lankford declined an interview request about his study and told Fox News in an email that he’s “not interested in giving any serious thought to John Lott or his claims.” With little success to stop the myth of mass shootings as a uniquely American problem becoming ingrained across the world, Lott took the matter into his own hands, releasing a comprehensive study this week that debunks Lankford’s claims. ARMING TEACHERS A DECISION FOR STATES, LOCAL DISTRICTS, DEVOS SAYS After crunching the numbers, Lott concluded in his study that the U.S. accounts for less than three percent of the world’s mass public shootings over a 15-year period – between 1998 and 2012 – which is significantly lower than what Lankford’s work has shown. ""My most conservative count is well over three thousand shooters over just the last 15 years. My best count is that there were 10,800 of these public mass shooters over the last 15 years."" — John. R. Lott Jr. Lott said that he looked at the last 15 years rather than the last 47 years as Lankford did, because it’s nearly impossible to come up with perfectly accurate information about mass public shooters in, for example, Africa in the 1960s. “My most conservative count is well over three thousand shooters over just the last 15 years. My best count is that there were 10,800 of these public mass shooters over the last 15 years,” Lott said. Compare that with Lankford’s research, which found merely 292 mass public shooters over a 47-year period across the world, with 90 of those in the U.S., per his research. CALIFORNIA BILL TO EXPAND GUN-TAKEAWAY LAW ADVANCES TO GOVERNOR'S DESK Lott is committed to transparency about his study, listing every single case used in the research in a massive 451-page appendix of the study. He claims to have used the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, complimented by additional search tools to find cases that weren’t listed in the dataset. Of 1,491 mass public shootings reviewed by Lott, only 43 of those were in the U.S. This represents just 2.88 percent of all the cases. In per capita terms, the data put the U.S. below Finland, Norway or Switzerland. It’s still slightly higher than other Western countries such as France, Germany or the United Kingdom. Lankford’s main conclusion of his data was that there’s something in the American culture that makes people commit more public mass shootings than people in other cultures. For Lott, the actual data shows that the mass shooter problem in the U.S. is far from being a unique American experience.

723,723,100331,https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/i-voted-against-an-assault-weapons-ban-heres-why-i-changed-my-mind/2018/10/01/3bfa76a0-c594-11e8-9b1c-a90f1daae309_story.html,I voted against an assault weapons ban. Here’s why I changed my mind.,"At the time, the Senate was voting on several gun-violence-prevention proposals, trying to find a bill that could get 60 votes. To me, it was clear that strengthening the background-check system would be the single most effective way to begin to stem the tide of gun violence in the United States. AD However, every proposal the Senate voted on that day fell short. Congress, in what has become a sad pattern of dysfunction, failed to act. AD In the years since the Senate last had a meaningful debate about gun-violence legislation, we’ve seen assault rifles and high-capacity magazines repeatedly used in mass shootings, with ever-higher body counts: Forty-nine murdered at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Fifty-eight killed and 422 wounded by gunfire in Las Vegas, one year ago Monday. We’ve seen the gun lobby close its eyes to the fact that assault rifles were the weapon of choice for the mass shooters at Parkland, Fla., and at Sandy Hook Elementary School — and to the reality that these weapons can kill with an efficiency that shotguns and handguns, like the ones I own, simply cannot match. AD Though I remain convinced that strengthening our background-check system is critical, I also believe we must do more to end mass shootings. So today I am signing on as a sponsor of the assault weapons ban. AD I do this as a gun owner and a proud supporter of the Second Amendment. Before coming to the Senate, I served as governor of Virginia, a state with a long tradition of gun ownership. During my time in office, I signed into law a number of reasonable bipartisan bills solidifying the rights of law-abiding gun owners to purchase and carry firearms for sport and self-defense. At the time, the National Rifle Association described me as a “valuable ally for gun owners and sportsmen.” While the NRA may have moved toward the extreme in the years since, I still believe in the Second Amendment. But like other parts of our Constitution, the Second Amendment isn’t absolute. For example, the law has long held that certain guns such as fully automatic rifles and accessories such as suppressors fall into a class of weapons requiring stricter oversight and regulation than your everyday hunting rifle. AD Unfortunately, these shades of gray needed for good policymaking have given way to the black and white of polarized political warfare that’s increasingly fueled by special-interest money. AD Still, I’m hopeful we can break this stalemate, disarming would-be mass shooters while still respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners. Restricting the sale of assault weapons is one such starting point. No doubt, there will need to be revisions and compromises before this bill becomes law. But let’s also recognize that the features and tactical accessories that define assault weapons under this legislation were designed for a specific purpose — to give soldiers an advantage over the enemy, not to mow down students in school hallways. AD We should acknowledge that while some will object to reasonable magazine-size limits, they would also force an active shooter to reload more often, buying law enforcement and potential shooting victims valuable seconds that could prove lifesaving. And let’s agree that modifications such as binary triggers and bump stocks, which skirt the law to effectively turn semiautomatic rifles into fully automatic weapons, should never have been on the streets in the first place. AD These are the core ideas behind the assault weapons ban. Some may worry that the technical challenges of defining an assault weapon may result in a law that’s either toothless or overly restrictive of gun rights. Frankly, I share those concerns, but it’s time to stop talking about the problem and do something about it. AD We have cultural divisions that must be bridged, but we should not allow these differences to become excuses for inaction.

Marco Rubio and Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida said Wednesday that they're introducing legislation that would encourage states to adopt so-called ""red flag"" gun laws, which allow people to file gun restraining orders to remove firearms from potentially violent individuals. The Florida Legislature is considering such a proposal, and the senators' bill would further incentivize states through grants from the Department of Justice to implement similar laws. States would get the grants if their legislation met certain criteria , primarily that family members or a law enforcement officer can petition for an individual's gun to be taken away if that person poses a threat to themselves or others. The law must require due process protections before an order can be issued, such as proper notice and a formal hearing. And states must establish a minimum penalty if a person files false allegations against an individual. The federal proposal comes after it was discovered that gunman Nikolas Cruz had exhibited several warning signs before he massacred 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, three weeks ago. Rubio said it's unclear whether this bill would have prevented the shooting, but that it would have been a tool for those who did have concerns about Cruz. ""This certainly would have provided an option that today does not exist,"" Rubio said at a news conference Wednesday. ""If today you believe someone was going to do something like this, you can report it, but there's very little you can do to remove guns from someone until that person's adjudicated, gone to jail or something like that.""

Coulter wrote on Twitter, linking to a  New York Times  article titled, """"Israel responded with rifle fire to a mass attempt by Palestinians to cross a border fence, killing at least 28, Palestinian officials said.""""  Britain, France and Germany called for the Israeli government to exercise restraint in dealing with protesters, while the White House blamed militant group Hamas for the violence. The protests broke out as the U.S. embassy was officially moved from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and also coincided with the 70th anniversary of Israel’s founding. Coulter, who has made a seven-figure fortune railing against progressive causes, has been one of the most public—and harshest—critics of illegal immigration. It's not the first time the conservative firebrand has proposed shooting migrants trying to enter the U.S. illegally. In an interview with radio program Right Wing Watch, Coulter suggested that using gunfire would send a warning.  """"If you shoot one to encourage the others, maybe they’ll learn, but otherwise, we’ll see, we’ll see,"""" she said, noting that President Donald Trump's proposed border wall was a more preferable option. Although she was a staunch advocate for Trump during the 2016 election, Coulter has seemingly become disillusioned with the blustery business mogul—in large part due to her disappointment with the president's treatment of DACA and illegal immigration. In January, she opined that the president's meeting with Democrats on the issue was the nadir  of Trump's presidency.  Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now In her recent book In Trump We Trust: E Pluribus Awesome!, she wrote that immigrants make the U.S. more dishonest.  'In the same way any immigrant to Finland makes it less white, any immigrant to America makes it less honest,' she opines in the book.  Conservative political commentator and author Ann Coulter discusses her """"Adios, America!

Alarmed gun sellers are joining the suicide prevention fight.","“At first I was very skeptical, because we have been trained to think when people talk about suicide that it’s nothing more than a veiled attempt to take away our guns,” said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state’s biggest gun-rights lobbying group. “Then I checked the data.” Aposhian was drawn into the issue in 2013, when Steve Eliason, a Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives, asked for his support on a campaign to curb suicides. The pitch included some alarming statistics: Utah had one of the country’s highest suicide rates, and half of them were by firearm. Of all of the state’s firearm-related deaths, 86 percent were suicides. Aposhian joined the Utah Suicide Prevention Coalition, which has developed literature to distribute at gun shops, produced videos and created a suicide-prevention training module for concealed-carry training courses. “We’re to the point now where we felt it would be a disservice and inappropriate to our membership to not let them know what’s going on in Utah and across the nation,” Aposhian said. The Utah partnership has trickled down to communities all over the state, including Washington County, where Rowdy Reeve’s range is and where nearly half of all households own at least one firearm and many children grow up handling them. The suicide rate there is twice the national rate. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha “We want to work with the gun owners instead of against them,” said Teresa Willie, the county’s suicide prevention coordinator. She oversees a campaign that includes public-education efforts at churches, schools and law enforcement agencies and running public service announcements on firearms and suicide before films at the local theater. “We don’t want to polarize the community at all,"" she said. Suicide prevention coordinator Teresa Willie at the Southwest Behavioral Health Center in St. George, Utah. Isaac Brekken / for NBC News Reeve sought Willie out after the suicide at his range in early 2014. She visited the range, and taught his workers how to identify warning signs from customers who could be suicidal — and how to help them. As Reeve listened, he felt a deepening sense of responsibility. “If we are going to be selling these things, then we should also offer people help if they have any problems,” he said. HOW THE MOVEMENT SPREAD The affiliation between the gun industry and public health advocates has its roots in New Hampshire, where in April 2009 a gun shop owner named Ralph Demicco found out that three people in one week had killed themselves using guns bought at his store. The news shook him; he considered himself a socially responsible business owner, and was cautious about selling firearms to people who seemed risky ─ drunk, on drugs, agitated, inexperienced. He was already a member of the New Hampshire Firearms Safety Coalition, which pressed gun-safety issues. “I was bewildered. I didn’t know what to do,” Demicco recalled. One of his colleagues from the coalition asked if he would help in a new suicide prevention effort, driven by research that identified guns as a major risk factor ─ not because gun owners were more suicidal than anyone else, but because suicide is often impulsive, and guns are an effective means of death. Suicide prevention advocates needed Demicco because they knew gun owners would trust him more than they would public health officials. Demicco agreed, and together they created The Gun Shop Project, distributing posters to retailers with tips on how to spot and help people who appear suicidal. The Gun Shop Project has since spread to 10 more states, including Utah, and there are similar partnerships in about 10 others, according to the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. Some are homegrown. Others are the result of a joint venture by the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade group that distributes suicide prevention “toolkits” to retailers and ranges. “It’s a chance to overturn myths about suicide in the gun-owning community,” said Bill Brassard Jr., a National Shooting Sports Foundation spokesman. ‘DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS, BUT YOU’VE GOT TO HAVE THEM’ Among those myths, according to researchers, is that if someone wants to end his or her life but doesn’t have access to a gun, the person will find another way. Researchers say that making it more difficult for someone who is suicidal to access a planned means of death can buy time until the suicidal thoughts subside. That is particularly important in the case of guns, which, they say, are present in about a third of American homes and are the most lethal method of suicide. About 85 percent of suicide attempts with a firearm end in death, while drug overdoses — the most common method of suicide attempts — are fatal in less than 3 percent of cases, according to researchers at the Harvard Injury Research Control Center. “The importance of education in talking to gun owners is not saying they shouldn’t own guns, and it has nothing to do with the Second Amendment,” said Marian Betz, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine and co-founder of the Colorado Firearm Safety Coalition, which has adopted the Gun Shop Project and National Shooting Sports Foundation programs. “It’s saying, ‘Sometimes we get so sad we can’t think straight, so how can we make things safer for you?’” Jacquelyn Clark, owner of the Bristlecone Shooting, Training and Retail Center in Denver and a member of Colorado’s firearm safety coalition, redoubled her efforts after a first-time customer shot himself at her range two years ago. Clark revamped her staff training and offered more customer-education literature, from suicide hotlines to gun-storage tips. She sought advice from other gun shops, adopting some of their rules, including a prohibition against new customers using the range alone without a recommendation from a family member, colleague or friend. The staff now looks more closely at new customers — and regulars — by examining eye contact, attention to safety briefings, and whether they seem in a rush. Clark’s staff turns away more people now. Employees once asked a regular customer, upset because his wife had left him, to come back another day. They once asked a new customer, who was alone and seemed to want to rush through a handgun purchase, for a personal reference; instead, he left. Some of these people leave angry. Some may not be dangerous to themselves or anyone else. But the cost of lost business is a price Clark said she’s willing to pay. “These can be difficult conversations, but you’ve got to have them,” Clark said. A GUN INSTRUCTOR’S MISSION In the city of Loretto, in rural central-south Tennessee, firearms instructor Matt Holt sees those uncomfortable conversations as a personal crusade. Four years ago, Holt learned that one of his closest friends had taken his own life with a gun. That motivated Holt to work with the Tennessee Suicide Prevention Network to persuade the state to require a suicide module in the state curriculum for handgun carry-permit training. The change went into effect July 1. When Holt teaches the 10-hour course, he starts the suicide section by telling his students about his friend — and other friends and family members, including his mother, who have tried to kill themselves. “I try to engage them, to get them talking about it. Really talking,” Holt said. He tells them about the signs of suicide, what to say to someone who exhibits them, and how to find a safe place for their guns. He knows his openness makes him an exception in the gun community. He wants the curriculum to include videos on suicide prevention, he says, because “a lot of instructors still don’t feel comfortable with suicide, either.” ‘IT’S GOT TO HELP’ Last year, a man in his 40s walked into Rowdy’s Range & Shooter Supply and asked to speak with someone in charge. Reeve and his two co-owners came to the desk and began chatting with him. “I’m suicidal,” the man said. He wanted help in keeping himself away from guns. He asked them to take his picture, share it with their staff and tell them that if he returned and inquired about renting a gun, to refuse. By then, Reeve had become trained to teach a suicide prevention course and was no longer unnerved by such conversations. He and his partners quickly agreed to the man’s request. They kept chatting for about 45 minutes before the man shook their hands and thanked them. He said he hoped he wouldn’t see them again. He hasn’t. Last Reeve heard, the man was doing fine. “We tell our staff not to see our customers as customers but as a person. Spend time to talk to them, what brings them in today, get to know them,” Reeve said. “I’m a firm believer that if we can get out there and teach these classes and spread the firearms safety word, it’s got to help.” If you or someone you know is in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255, text TALK to 741741 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.",Gun Suicide Firearm Shooting range Shooting Gun ownership Gun safety Handgun Suicide prevention Mass shooting,"Rrowdy Reeve, a former member of the Utah Rifle Sports Council, at his range in Utah.","“At first I was very skeptical, because we have been trained to think when people talk about suicide that it’s nothing more than a veiled attempt to take away our guns,” said Clark Aposhian, chairman of the Utah Shooting Sports Council, the state’s biggest gun-rights lobbying group. “Then I checked the data.” Aposhian was drawn into the issue in 2013, when Steve Eliason, a Republican member of the Utah House of Representatives, asked for his support on a campaign to curb suicides.","first i was very skeptical, because we have been trained to think when people talk about suicide that it’s nothing more than a veiled attempt to take away our guns,philes. the state's biggest gun-rights lobbying group was drawn into the issue in 2013, when steve eliason, a republican member of the utah house of representatives, asked for his support on a campaign to curb suicides. some alarming statistics: utah had one of the country's highest suicide rates, and half of them were by firearm. of all of the state’s firearm-related deaths, and 86 percent were suicides. nearly half of all households own at least",1,2,5,99,2,0,0,99.0,0,99

The first tip came five months ago. However, the FBI said agents were unable to link the tip to Cruz at the time. In the second tip, made six weeks ago, the bureau admitted protocol was not followed and the information was never investigated. Here’s everything the FBI says it knew before the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Sept. 24, 2017: A YouTube comment The FBI said it was notified about a comment on YouTube five months ago from someone with the username “nikolas cruz.” The comment said: “I’m going to be a professional school shooter.” Ben Bennight, a video blogger on YouTube, told CNN he reported the comment at the time, leading to an interview with agent. However, Bennight, who lives in Mississippi, told the agents he had no information about who made the comment. “I saw the story kind of go across my news feed, but I didn’t pay a whole lot of attention to it. But when the FBI said it was the same name, the first thing that went through my mind was, “Wow, I hope you were at least watching this guy that I alerted you to months ago,'” Bennight told CNN. FBI Special Agent Rob Lasky, during a press conference on Thursday, said agents investigated the comment, but could not make identify the person behind it. “No other information was included with that comment which would indicate a time, location or the true identity of the person who made the comment. The FBI conducted database reviews, checks, but was unable to further identify the person who actually made the comment,” Lasky said. Jan. 5, 2018: Tip about ‘the potential’ for a school shooting The FBI admitted agents received a tip in January from someone who was close to Nikolas Cruz, giving information on his “gun ownership, desire to kill people, erratic behavior, and disturbing social media posts, as well as the potential of him conducting a school shooting.” Story continues The FBI said the tip should have been assessed as “a potential threat to life” and forwarded to the Miami Field Office. This would have led to additional “investigative steps,” which were not conducted. “We are still investigating the facts. I am committed to getting to the bottom of what happened in this particular matter, as well as reviewing our processes for responding to information that we receive from the public. It’s up to all Americans to be vigilant, and when members of the public contact us with concerns, we must act properly and quickly,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.

We won't be the one who gets that phone call about someone you love who did."" ""Are you really willing to keep playing those odds?"" he asked. ""Have we forgotten that life is a gift?"" Lemon called it a ""disgrace"" that these mass shootings are still happening after so many in the past. ""This is who we are, right, but is this really who we want to be? A country where anybody at anytime could be shot to death?"" he said. ""And then when a bunch of people are killed and lives are shattered, we are sad, and maybe angry, and then we forget and we move on until the next time."" Lemon called for people to forget politics. He said we need to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. ""People who oppose gun control will say today's not the day to talk about it.

675,675,110453,https://www.yahoo.com/news/one-big-loser-black-friday-104339303.html,One Big Loser on Black Friday? Gun Sales,"The presents may not yet be wrapped and under the tree, but at least they’re in transit with a tracking number. With spending increasingly moving online, a new set of winners is emerging as the Black Friday holiday shopping weekend comes to a close. “We are seeing a fundamental shift in who’s considered winners and losers coming out of Black Friday this year,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus said. “Whether you’re talking about department stores, mass merchants or specialty apparel chains, consumers are voting with their online spending and driving this evolution.” Prognosticators went into Thanksgiving expecting this holiday shopping season to be one of the best since the recession, possibly rivaling the boom days of the mid 2000s. The economy is growing, gas prices are low and median wages have been rising. But not everyone can come out on top. Here’s a look at who’s having a merry season — and who’s out in the cold. WINNERS: Amazon Gone are the days of Thanksgiving-night stampedes. Americans spent a record $7.9 billion online on Cyber Monday, up more than 19 percent from last year’s totals, making it the largest digital shopping day of all time in the U.S., according to Adobe Analytics. But mobile and desktop spending wasn’t just a Monday phenomenon: It came on top of the $3.7 billion spent on Thanksgiving Day and $6.2 billion on Black Friday itself. Amazon.com Inc. reaped a lot of those rewards. The internet retailer saw its biggest shopping day in history on Cyber Monday, with the most products ordered worldwide than any other day. Amazon customers ordered more than 18 million toys and 13 million fashion items on Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined, with the new Echo Dot Alexa device the top selling product on Amazon globally over the holiday weekend. Mass-Merchant Retailers Despite Amazon’s encroachment, big-box retailers still know how to pull off a dynamite Black Friday. Walmart Inc., Best Buy Co. and Target Corp. all kicked off holiday promotions weeks before the big weekend but still found ways to entice buyers with the Black Friday doorbusters and promotions they’ve become famous for. Story continues Target, which added about 500 square feet of additional space for toys across 500 stores this season, was rewarded. Walmart also benefited from the absence of Toys “R” Us. “Target and Walmart seemed to do the best job of picking up toy market share,” Barclays analysts said in a note. Best Buy was a winner in TV sales, KeyBanc analysts wrote, helped in part by its unlikely ally — Amazon, which has partnered with the nation’s biggest electronics chain to sell smart televisions embedded with Amazon’s Fire platform. Kohl’s Corp. is another retailer that has aligned with the online giant, setting up Amazon-branded shops in about 30 stores and processing returns of Amazon purchases. Like Walmart and Target, Kohl’s benefited from high demand for kitchen appliances like the cult favorite Instant Pot, which all retailers discounted heavily over the weekend to entice shoppers to move beyond toys and televisions. Teen, Toy Retailers The two biggest sellers on Cyber Monday were both toys: WowWee’s Fingerlings and L.O.L. Surprise by MGA Entertainment Inc., both of which had made Toy Insider’s Hot 20 list. Nintendo Switch came in third, though it was the No. 1 online purchase made on Thanksgiving Day itself, Adobe data show. L.O.L. Surprise brand — a line of collectible dolls and accessories that kids unwrap — sold well at Target, according to store manager Rob Stermann. With the store open earlier on Thanksgiving Day compared with previous years, that attracted entire families to come shop, rather than just parents. Families with kids tend to shop the entire store, rather than just coming for one big item, he said. Teen retailers also had a strong weekend. Cowen & Co. analysts said American Eagle Outfitters Inc. plus L Brands Inc.’s Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works had a noticeable uptick in foot traffic by younger shoppers. A-Line Partners said it saw an influx of shopping bags from Victoria’s Secret PINK, Forever 21 and Hollister Co. during its mall checks. The PINK stores that A-Line Partners visited in Los Angeles were so busy, the locations were doing crowd control, it said. Logistics Companies The holiday rush is also a boon for United Parcel Service Inc., FedEx Corp., the U.S. Postal Service and other regional parcel delivery companies. In the last three months of 2017, the volume for UPS’s ground deliveries surged to 17 million packages per day, up 31 percent from the previous three quarters’ average. FedEx said it plans to hire about 55,000 temporary workers to meet the surge in holiday demand, 5,000 more than a year ago. The courier also increased delivery days per week to six from five, a move it plans to make permanent after the seasonal rush. UPS began delivering six days a week last year and has added sorting capacity to handle the extra work. “We’re flexing the UPS network to handle nearly double our normal daily volume with permanent and temporary facilities, advanced operational and customer technologies and 100,000 seasonal employees,” Glenn Zaccara, a spokesman for Atlanta-based UPS, said in an emailed statement. LOSERS: Physical Stores Although some crowded big-box and department stores made it look like the 2000s, the overall traffic trend was down. U.S. store traffic was down 1 percent on Thanksgiving and Black Friday combined versus 2017 levels, according to ShopperTrak. RetailNext, which measures store traffic, found that brick-and-mortar sales during the four-day period from Thanksgiving to Sunday were down 6.6 percent. “Overall spending leading up to and including Black Friday is higher than last year, though online shopping likely detracted from in-store visits,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Bartashus and Poonam Goyal said. “With many doorbuster promotions available online and in stores, there was less motivation for customers to venture to stores.” Mall-staple Sears Holdings Corp., which is still open for business this holiday despite an October bankruptcy filing, said Black Friday traffic for Sears and Kmart was “softer than last year.” According to Peter Boutros, president of the Kenmore, Craftsman and DieHard brands, shoppers are “cherry picking deals and going to different retailers” to snag the cheapest prices. Retailers’ Web Teams Some legacy retailers also found their less-than-robust websites couldn’t keep up with the influx of traffic. Home-improvement store Lowe’s Cos. temporarily showed an error message on Friday afternoon. J. Crew’s homepage went down Friday, too, with a full-page banner asking customers to “hang on a sec” amid higher than normal traffic. Lululemon Athletica Inc. said on Facebook late Thanksgiving that it was “working hard to get the dot com running smoothly again.” Even Walmart reported some issues amid higher than expected web traffic. Mobile shopping garnered more than half of all traffic to retail sites on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to data provider SimilarWeb, and some retailers missed out on the surge. And for those retailers who did just fine online, the surge of discounting shipping offers will hit their margins come February. “Many retailers have upped their free-shipping game, as the battle for superior convenience and speedier delivery rages on,” said Scot Ciccarelli, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. Firearms It appears gun sales were down this holiday season. While there is no exact count of firearms sold in America, a common barometer is the bureau’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and it showed background checks down more than 10 percent on Black Friday this year. Buying guns has become something of a Thanksgiving tradition in the U.S., with retailers offering discounts and giveaways on firearms and accessories for the holiday shopping rush. But gun sales declined after the election of Donald Trump, whose Republican party generally opposes restrictions to firearm access.",Weapon Gun Gun control Firearm Gun shop Airsoft Guns Assault weapon Concealed carry Ammunition Universal background check,A toy store in New York.,"The presents may not yet be wrapped and under the tree, but at least they’re in transit with a tracking number.

More than a dozen companies have already severed their ties with the NRA, while multinational delivery services company FedEx announced that, despite having a different stance on gun policy, it would continue its partnership with the NRA. “FedEx opposes assault rifles being in the hands of civilians,” the statement reads. “The NRA is one of hundreds of organizations in our alliances/association Marketing program whose members receive discounted rates for FedEx shipping. FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues.” The company was forced to address the continuing controversy on Tuesday, however, with a follow-up statement that appeared to further distance the company from the gun rights group. “FedEx has never provided any donation or sponsorship to the NRA which is one of hundreds of alliance and association participants that serve more than one million customers. FedEx remains committed to all our customers and the pricing we provide them independent of their political affiliations and views.

ABC News identified several companies that appeared to have active deals with the NRA but have yet to address the controversy. Clearent Card Processing Services, an NRA-endorsed merchant services program, offers discounts up to 40% on credit and debit card processing fees. Clearent did not respond to numerous requests for comment. eHealth, an insurance company, invites NRA members to enroll through a specific portal, but does not list a specific discount. eHealth did not respond to numerous requests for comment. FFL BizHub, a software application that “helps individuals and entities learn and comply with Federal ATF and State firearm laws” offered “discounted enrollment” of an unspecified amount, according to the NRA Business Alliance’s website.

Susan Hatfield (R) was previously endorsed by the Connecticut Citizens Defense League (CCDL) in her primary race for attorney general, Fox 61 News reported Sunday. The CCDL, however, withdrew its endorsement on Thursday after Hatfield condemned 3D printed firearms. “While we still feel she would make a far better Attorney General than any of the other candidates in the race, we simply cannot endorse the recent comments she’s made,” the gun rights group said in a blog post. ADVERTISEMENT The comments mentioned referred to Hatfield’s statement against “ghost guns” — firearms assembled from mail-order kits or manufactured with 3D printers. “3D-printed firearms are not only unnecessary but will make our communities and state less safe,” Hatfield said in a statement to the local CT Mirror newspaper. “Preventing 3D-printed firearms shouldn’t be a political issue and instead of politicians trying to divide us we should work together to find a way to stop criminals, gangs, and terrorist from getting the blueprints to print 3D-printed firearms,” she added. Hatfield, who was a Trump delegate during the 2016 Republican National Convention, urged the president to reinstate the national ban on 3D printed guns, the CT Mirror reported. The CCDL said in its statement that it is up to candidates to “defend the 2nd Amendment in the face of political press from other candidates, or from media inquires.” Hatfield defended her comments on Saturday, writing on her campaign’s Facebook page that she is and “will always remain a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment.” “I share the concern that 3D guns will make our community less safe and put law enforcement officers in harm’s way,” Hatfield said. “I believe responsible gun owners, including most of the members of CCDL, share this view. The bottom line is that as attorney general I will put the safety of Connecticut residents first — always.” Nineteen states and the District of Columbia are suing the Trump administration and the group Defense Distributed to block a settlement that allows for blueprints for 3D printed guns to be uploaded to the internet.

""As you review the contents of this reply, we believe it is important to tell you that we respect the national debate that is currently underway regarding firearms and safety,"" the letter from American Outdoo (AOBC)r said. ""The solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company, our employees, our industry, our shareholders, the economies we support and, significantly, the rights of our law abiding customers, but results in no increase in public safety,"" said the company. The company made the Smith & Wesson AR-15-style rifle used to kill 17 people in the mass shooting in Parkland, according to the Broward County Sheriff's Department. ""We share the nation's grief over the incomprehensible and senseless loss of life in Parkland, Florida, and we share the desire to make our communities safer,"" said the letter. The company said it wanted to ""address the challenges of acute mental illness in our society"" and improve the federal background check system, a move that has also been floated by the National Rifle Association and other groups that oppose tightened gun control. Related: BlackRock has questions for gun makers BlackRock, which manages trillions of dollars for other investors, is the leading shareholder for American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger (RGR). It is the second-biggest shareholder of Vista Outdoor (VSTO). All three of those companies make guns, including AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles. BlackRock said it will start offering clients the option to invest in funds that exclude firearm manufacturers and retailers. It also said it will more actively engage with gun manufacturers, and in some instances vote against the wishes of company management. In response to American Outdoor, BlackRock said: ""Responsible business policies and practices are critical to firearms manufacturers' long-term prospects."" ""We will continue to engage with these companies to further understand their business policies and practices in order to protect our clients' investments in them,"" BlackRock said. Related: Gun sales plunge for Smith & Wesson owner In the weeks after the Parkland shooting, gun control advocates encouraged companies to reevaluate their relationship with gun makers and the National Rifle Association, the country's most powerful gun lobby. Companies including Delta Air Line (DAL)and Enterprise Holdings, which owns Enterprise Rent-A-Car, Alamo Rent a Car and National Car Rental, ended discounts for NRA members. Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), a gun retailer, said it would stop selling AR-15-style rifles, and wouldn't sell any guns to anyone under 21. Walmart (WMT)stopped selling them in 2015, and also raised its minimum purchase age last week, as did the grocery chain Kroger (KR), which sells guns through its Fred Meyer stores.

Andrew Cuomo. In a lawsuit, the NRA alleges that Cuomo and state regulators are seeking to “deprive the NRA and its constituents of their First Amendment rights to speak freely about gun-related issues and defend the Second Amendment.” At issue is a campaign by the Democratic governor to discourage insurance companies and financial firms from working with the NRA. The NRA claims that what it describes as New York’s “blacklisting” would “imminently” deprive it of basic banking and other financial services “essential to the NRA’s corporate existence and its advocacy mission.” In its court filing, the NRA said that Cuomo and state regulators “seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional-rights advocates,” adding that “if their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed.” Cuomo scoffed at the NRA’s lawsuit on Friday. “New York will not be intimidated by the NRA’s frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda,” he said. The state is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit with New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood downplaying the group’s concerns. Although Underwood acknowledged that Cuomo and the NRA have a “longstanding history of strong disagreement” on gun control, she said the lawsuit did not allege that New York “directly inhibited the NRA from expressing its opposition to gun regulation. Instead, it presents a speculative and implausible ‘parade of horribles’.” Twitter users, for their part, knew exactly how to respond to the NRA’s tale of woe: “Thoughts and prayers.” Twitter was suddenly filled with well-wishers for the organization who repeated what has become the cliché phrase that gun advocates use whenever there is a mass shooting.

Javier Perez fired a gun in the air in Brooklyn to scare away a rival gang in 2016. He has admitted as much, saying he borrowed the gun. But his lawyers are arguing that the Second Amendment voids the charge, because it doesn't specify that noncitizens don't have the right to bear arms. ""The Framers were clear: If they meant citizens, they would have said citizens,"" Perez's attorney Samuel Jacobsen argued in court Wednesday. ""There is no suggestion that there was a concept of 'illegal alien' and no suggestion that if you were from a foreign country, you couldn't bear arms."" What's the basis of Perez's argument? Perez's attorney is largely basing their argument on the 2008 Supreme Court decision District of Columbia v. Heller, which struck down a Washington, D.C., handgun ban. Jacobsen argues that because the ruling says it's preemptively lawful to prevent mentally unstable people or felons from possessing guns, but doesn't say the same thing for illegal immigrants, that the Second Amendment must apply to Perez. What do prosecutors say? The prosecution argues that the state has a legitimate interest in preventing gun ownership for ""those who are difficult to track, with no permanent address and who may have an interest in evading law enforcement."" Specifically, illegal immigrants. ""They have an interest in not maintaining a stable residence or registering a firearm,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Tanya Hajjar argued in court. Hajjar also argued that three circuit courts have rejected similar arguments to Perez's, and two federal appeals courts have upheld the statute by saying it has reasonable public safety goals. What will happen? Since the Supreme Court has not explicitly addressed the issue of gun rights for noncitizens, this case is being allowed to move forward in court. Pratheepan Gulasekaram, a Santa Clara University law professor, said Perez may have a chance. ""The more one believes the Second Amendment is an individual right of self-defense, the harder it gets to say noncitizens are categorically not protected,"" Gulasekaram told the New York Daily News. ""Any statute that makes firearms rights depend purely on immigrant status is constitutionally vulnerable.""

Photo by Randy Shropshire/Getty Images) Luke Steele, frontman of Australian space-rockers Empire of the Sun, jokes that he’s “slowly becoming an American” after living in Los Angeles for several years. “L.A., they say, is the storytelling capital of the world,” he says, chatting with Yahoo Music backstage before Empire’s concert at the Doritos Mix Arcade event at Los Angeles’s E3 Gaming Expo this week. “It’s an imaginative playground for all ages. I think it’s the gateway to the world, really. That’s what’s exciting for me. The opportunities are endless.” However, after the tragic massacre at gay nightclub Pulse last weekend (along with the gunning down of Voice star Christina Grimmie in the same city, Orlando), one has to ask what the Perth-born Steele thinks of America these days. After strict gun-control laws were instated in his native country 20 years ago, the chances of being murdered by a gun in Australia plunged by 72 percent, according to Reuters – and the country has had no mass shootings since. Many gun-control activists cite Australia’s policies when criticizing the more lenient gun laws in America. “No one has guns in Australia – except for the police, or farmers. That just seems to make sense,” Steele says. “Why does everyone need a gun? That’s just what I do not understand. It’s kind of scary, the way the world is going… I just don’t understand why they don’t just ban guns [in the United States]. Like, if someone wants to be President, why don’t they make that one of the things they’ll do?” For now, though, Steele is still living the American dream: His group’s fittingly titled debut single, “Walking on a Dream,” has surprisingly become their first U.S. radio hit a full eight years after its original release, thanks to its inclusion in a Honda commercial. The unexpected revival of the title track off Empire’s debut LP hasn’t derailed the group’s plans to release their yet-untitled third album, which they just completed last week – but, Steele admits, it certainly has “turned up the stakes a bit.” Steele describes the forthcoming album, which was partially recorded at two iconic American studios (Jim Henson Studios in Hollywood, and Island Studios in Hawaii, where Kanye West recorded 808s & Heartbreak), as “a warm summer breeze, a warm record, a record that feels good. Everyone says it’s our best record – but I suppose people always say that!” Most exciting, however, is that the album will feature two American rock icons, one of which is Fleetwood Mac’s Lindsey Buckingham. Considering that “I’ll Be Around,” from Empire’s 2013 sophomore effort Ice on the Dune, basically sounded like an outtake from Fleetwood Mac’s Mirage album, this new collaboration makes perfect sense. “One of my favorite things to do is sit with my wife, drink white wine, and just listen to records once the kids have gone to bed. And I always end up emailing my manager and saying, ‘I wanna work with this person,’” Steele chuckles. “Nine times out of 10, they never get back to me. But Lindsey got back to us and said, ‘I love the band; I wanna come down to the studio.’ We jammed for about six hours, and then he came back the next day and we wrote this amazing song, ‘To Her Door.’”",Empire of the Sun Getty Images  Photography Stock photography Music Image News Lead Vocals Concert,Empire of the Sun performing at the Doritos “Jackson” show at E3 in Los Angeles.,"(Empire of the Sun perform at the Doritos #MixArcade at E3 2016.

Forensic psychologist Rena Isen testified Wednesday that Reinking is currently unfit for trial, saying Reinking isn't complying with his medication, which could potentially treat his illness. Victims' relatives and friends groaned and mumbled at the testimony, and some were on the verge of tears. Updates on Reinking's condition are due every six months, though if he becomes fit to stand trial, Fishburn said to notify him immediately.

The meeting between US President Donald Trump and the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) trade group comes less than a month after a teenaged gunman bearing a semi-automatic weapon shot dead 17 people at his former Florida high school. In the aftermath of the attack Trump pointed to video games as a possible contributing factor to the firearms violence plaguing the nation. ""We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed,"" the Republican leader said. ""And also video games. I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts."" But the ESA says gaming is ""plainly"" not at fault, wielding data showing no established link between games and violence in the flesh. ""Like all Americans, we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States,"" the ESA said in response to an AFP inquiry about the upcoming White House meeting. ""Video games are plainly not the issue: entertainment is distributed and consumed globally, but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation."" Video games are calculated to be a $100 billion a year global business by market intelligence firm NewZoo. - White House rematch - Thursday's meeting comes five years after Joe Biden, then vice president, met with the ESA, heads of major video game companies, and researchers as the nation grappled with Connecticut's Sandy Hook massacre that saw 20 primary school-age children gunned down. Following that shooting the National Rifle Association singled out video games as the true danger to society. ""There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows violence against its own people,"" said the NRA's Wayne LaPierre, blaming ""vicious violent video games"" as well as ""bloodsoaked films."" But gaming industry veteran Mark DeLoura -- who attended the Biden meeting and later spent two years as a White House senior adviser for digital media -- said that ""if anything, it seems like it has gotten clearer there is no correlation."" ""All of our research related to games is there, Trump would just have to ask for it,"" he said. ""That makes me mad; one administration should learn from another."" Both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have taken a stance in recent years against children and teens playing violent video games. But a rising number of academics question the evidence of a link between gaming and aggression, and more than 200 scholars joined to speak out against an APA report affirming such a connection. - 'Gut-feelings' vs 'facts' - It is not the first time video games have come under scrutiny: a high-profile 1993 congressional hearing spearheaded by Democratic senators targeted games including ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Night Trap"" for violent play, with some lawmakers saying the games encouraged or desensitized minors to brutality and bloodshed. A later effort by California officials to ban sales of violent video games to children was struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2011 on the grounds that, like books and films, games are protected by constitutional rights to free speech. DeLoura said blaming video games that feature brutal play might stem from the ""gut-feelings"" of adults watching children engage in virtual battles, rather than hard data. ""What's causing shootings is guns are so accessible that when you have an impulse, you can act on it,"" he said. ""Does it have to be more complicated than that?"" With a gun culture that runs deep, America is deadlocked over how to stem the scourge of mass shootings. But video games, the industry holds, are innocent. ""Blaming video games for violence in the real world is no more productive than blaming the news media for bringing violent crimes into our homes night after night,"" the ESA says on its website. Video game play is booming as spectator sport, with fans flocking to arenas for tournaments as well as watching matches online. The association notably cites data trends showing that violent crime, particularly by young people, has declined in the US since the early 1990s -- even as video games have flourished. ""The rise of this conversation again isn't about facts, it isn't about research,"" said DeLoura in a recent blog post.

But there’s less consensus on whether media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence, which is a more serious form of aggression in which the perpetrator is subject to arrest and incarceration — the sort of violence that includes using a weapon to harm or kill people. The link between media violence and mass shootings is even more tenuous. Compared with acts of aggression and violence, mass shootings are relatively rare events, which makes conducting conclusive research on them difficult. President Trump first raised the issue during a meeting on school safety with local and state officials, which took place a week after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. The shooter, 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, reportedly obsessively played violent video games. Trump, Feb. 22: We have to look at the Internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds, and their minds are being formed. And we have to do something about maybe what they’re seeing and how they’re seeing it. And also video games. I’m hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people’s thoughts. And then you go the further step, and that’s the movies. You see these movies, they’re so violent. Trump discussed the issue again with members of Congress on Feb. 28 during another meeting on school safety. During that discussion, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, now running for the Senate, claimed mothers have told her they’re “very concerned” that “exposure” to entertainment media has “desensitized” children to violence. Previously:Trump to meet with video game makers on whether games cause violence More:Video games are good for children, no matter what Trump says More:Facebook pulls violent virtual reality games from CPAC booth after Parkland Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley also said during the meeting: “[Y]ou see all these films about everybody being blown up. Well, just think of the impact that makes on young people.” The points Trump and members of Congress raise aren’t unfounded, but the research on the subject is complex. Scientists who study the effect of media violence have taken issue with how the popular press has portrayed their work, arguing that the nuance of their research is often left out. In a 2015 review of the scientific literature on video game violence, the American Psychological Association elaborates on this point. APA, 2015: News commentators often turn to violent video game use as a potential causal contributor to acts of mass homicide. The media point to perpetrators’ gaming habits as either a reason they have chosen to commit their crimes or as a method of training. This practice extends at least as far back as the Columbine massacre (1999). … As with most areas of science, the picture presented by this research is more complex than is usually depicted in news coverage and other information prepared for the general public. Here, we break down the facts — nuance included — on the effect of media violence on young people. Is media violence a risk factor for aggression? The 2015 report by the APA on video games is a good place to start. After systematically going through the scientific literature, the report’s authors “concluded that violent video game use has an effect on aggression.” In particular, the authors explain that this effect manifests as an increase in aggressive behaviors, thoughts and feelings and a decrease in helping others, empathy and sensitivity to aggression. Though limited, evidence also suggests that “higher amounts of exposure” to video games is linked to “higher levels of aggression,” the report said. The report emphasized that “aggression is a complex behavior” caused by multiple factors, each of which increases the likelihood that an individual will be aggressive. “Children who experience multiple risk factors are more likely to engage in aggression,” the report said. More:Kentucky governor blames violent video games, movies, not guns for school shootings More:States with the most (and least) gun violence. See where your state stacks up. The authors came to their conclusions because researchers have consistently found the effect across three different kinds of studies: cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies and laboratory experiments. “One method’s limits are offset by another method’s strengths,” the APA report explains, so only together can they be used to infer a causal relationship. Cross-sectional studies find correlations between different phenomena at one point in time. They’re relatively easy to conduct, but they can’t provide causal evidence because correlations can be spurious. For example, an increase in video game sales might correlate with a decrease in violent crime, but that doesn’t necessarily mean video games prevent violent crime. Other unknown factors might also be at play. Longitudinal panel studies collect data on the same group over time, sometimes for decades. They’re used to investigate long-term effects, such as whether playing video games as a child might correlate with aggression as an adult. These studies also measure other risk factors for aggression, such as harsh discipline from parents, with the aim of singling out the effect of media violence. For this reason, these studies provide better evidence for causality than cross-sectional studies, but they are more difficult to conduct. Laboratory experiments manipulate one phenomenon — in this case, exposure to media violence — and keep all others constant. Because of their controlled environment, experiments provide strong evidence for a causal effect. But for the same reason, laboratory studies may not accurately reflect how people act in the real world. This brings us to why debate still exists among scientists studying media violence. Some researchers have found that the experimental evidence backing the causal relationship between playing video games and aggression might not be as solid as it seems. Last July, Joseph Hilgard, an assistant professor of psychology at Illinois State University, and others published a study in the journal Psychological Bulletin that found that laboratory experiments on the topic may be subject to publication bias. This means that studies that show the effect may be more likely to be published than those that don’t, skewing the body of evidence. After Hilgard corrected for this bias, the effect of violent video games on aggressive behavior and emotions did still exist, but it was reduced, perhaps even to near zero. However, the effect on aggressive thoughts remained relatively unaffected by this publication bias. The researchers also found that cross-sectional studies weren’t subject to publication bias. They didn’t examine longitudinal studies, which have shown that youth who play more violent video games are more likely to report aggressive behavior over time. Hilgard looked at a 2010 literature review by Craig A. Anderson, the director of the Center for the Study of Violence at Iowa State University, and others. Published in Psychological Bulletin, this review influenced the APA’s report. In response, Anderson took a second look at his review and found that the effect of violent video games on aggression was smaller than he originally thought, but not as small as Hilgard found. For this reason, he argued the effect was still a “societal concern.” To be clear, Hilgard is arguing that there’s more uncertainty in the field than originally thought, not that video games have no effect on aggression. He’s also not the first to find that research on video games may be suffering from publication bias. But what about movies and television? Reviews of the literature on these forms of media tend to be less recent, Kenneth A. Dodge, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, told us by email. Dodge, also one of the authors of the 2015 APA study, pointed us to one 1994 review of the literature on television published in the journal Communication Research that concluded that television violence also “increases aggressiveness and antisocial behavior.” Dodge told us he’s “confident” the effect this analysis and others found “would hold again today.” Dodge also pointed us to a 2006 study that reviewed the literature on violent video games, films, television and other media together. “Most contemporary studies start with the premise that children are exposed [to violence] through so many diverse media that they start to group them together,” said Dodge. Published in JAMA Pediatrics, the review found that exposure to violent media increases the likelihood of aggressive behavior, thoughts and feelings. The review also found media decreases the likelihood of helping behavior. All of these effects were “modest,” the researchers concluded. Overall, most of the research suggests media violence is a risk factor for aggression, but some experts in the field still question whether there’s enough evidence to conclusively say there’s a link. Is violent media a risk factor for violence? There’s even less evidence to suggest media violence is a risk factor for criminal violence. “In psychological research, aggression is usually conceptualized as behavior that is intended to harm another,” while, “[v]iolence can be defined as an extreme form of physical aggression,” the 2015 APA report explains. “Thus, all violence is aggression, but not all aggression is violence.” The APA report said studies have been conducted on media violence’s relationship with “criminal violence,” but the authors “did not find enough evidence of sufficient utility to evaluate whether” there’s a solid link to violent video game use. This lack of evidence is due, in part, to the fact that there are ethical limitations to conducting experiments on violence in the laboratory, especially when it comes to children and teens, the report explains. That leaves only evidence from cross-sectional studies and longitudinal studies. So what do those studies say? One longitudinal study, published in the journal Developmental Psychology in 2003, found that, out of 153 males, those who watched the most violent television as children were more likely 15 years later “to have pushed, grabbed, or shoved their spouses, to have responded to an insult by shoving a person” or to have been “to have been convicted of a crime” during the previous year. Girls who watched the most violent television were also more likely to commit similar acts as young women. These effects persisted after controlling for other risk factors for aggression, such as parental aggression and intellectual ability. A 2012 cross-sectional study that Anderson, at Iowa State, and others published in the journal Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice did find that the amount of violent video games juvenile delinquents played correlated with how many violent acts they had committed over the past year. The violent acts included gang fighting, hitting a teacher, hitting a parent, hitting other students and attacking another person. However, a 2008 review of the literature published in the journal Criminal Justice and Behavior concluded that “the effects of exposure to media violence on criminally violent behavior have not been established.” But the authors clarify: “Saying that the effect has not been established is not the same as saying that the effect does not exist.” In contrast to the APA report, Anderson and a colleague argue in a 2015 article published in American Behavioral Scientist that “research shows that media violence is a causal risk factor not only for mild forms of aggression but also for more serious forms of aggression, including violent criminal behavior.” Why did Anderson and his colleagues come to different conclusions than the APA? He told us that the APA “did not include the research literature on TV violence,” and excluded “several important studies on video game effects on violent behavior published since 2013.” In their 2015 article, Anderson and his colleague clarify that, even if there is a link, it “does not mean that violent media exposure by itself will turn a normal child or adolescent who has few or no other risk factors into a violent criminal or a school shooter.” They add, “Such extreme violence is rare, and tends to occur only when multiple risk factors converge in time, space, and within an individual.” Multiple experts we spoke with did point to one factor unique to the United States that they argue increases the risk of mass shootings and lethality of violence in general — access to guns. For example, Anderson told us by email: “There is a pretty strong consensus among violence researchers in psychology and criminology that the main reason that U.S. homicide rates are so much higher than in most Western democracies is our easy access to guns.” Dodge, at Duke, echoed Anderson’s point.”The single most obvious and probably largest difference between a country like the US that has many mass shootings and other developed countries is the easy access to guns,” he said. So while scientists disagree about how much evidence is enough to sufficiently support a causal link between media violence and real world violence, Trump and other politicians’ concerns aren’t unfounded.

It is a place of peace. It is a place of grace. It is a place where a community comes together to celebrate what they hold most dear and most sacred,"" Scott Brady, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, told reporters during a Sunday morning news conference of the attack at Tree of Life Synagogue in a neighborhood known as the center of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community. Advertisement Brady and law enforcement officials said Robert Bowers, 46, entered the Tree of Life Synagogue on Saturday armed with three Glock handguns and an AR-15 assault rifle. Brady said Bowers shouted about his desired to “kill Jewish people,” and, around 9:45 a.m., began shooting for about 20 minutes. Multiple media reports said Bowers maintained social media profiles rife with anti-Semitic views on which he reportedly wrote that Jews are “enemies of white people.” Brady said law enforcement officials are treating the murders as a hate crime. Those killed Saturday ranged in age from 54 to 97. They included a husband and wife, Sylvan and Bernice Simon, and brothers Cecil and David Rosenthal. The oldest victim was 97-year-old Rose Mallinger. Karl Williams, chief medical examiner of Allegheny County, said his office is working closely with local rabbis to try to release the bodies to their families as quickly as possible. It is the custom of observant Jews to attempt to bury the deceased within 24 hours. “I’ve seen this room a lot of times on TV, and I never thought I would be at this podium,” said Jeffrey Finkelstein, CEO of the United Jewish Federation of Pittsburgh. “We’re going to do everything we can to help the families and we’ll be there for them.” Bowers was charged Saturday night with 29 federal crimes, including 11 counts of obstructing the exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and 11 counts of use of a firearm to commit murder. He also faces state charges. Brady pointed out that many of those counts carry the possibility of the death penalty. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the shooting is the deadliest attack on Jewish Americans in the nation’s history. The synagogue is located in Squirrel Hill, a Pittsburgh neighborhood known as a Jewish enclave. A 2017 survey by the Jewish Community Foundation of Greater Pittsburgh called the neighborhood the “center of Jewish life” and found it is home to 26 percent of the city’s Jewish households. Four police officers were injured responding to the shooting. One was released on Saturday, and it was hoped that another would be released Sunday. The other two officers will remain hospitalized for a longer time period. Brady, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto and others praised the officers’ actions as heroic. Robert Jones, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Pittsburgh Field Office, said that, had officers not intervened, it is “likely additional violence would have occurred.” Peduto praised his city’s resilience and said the response of its residents and others since the shootings shows him that society wants to move beyond the hate that appeared to have motivated the attack. “There is a commonality throughout the world of people who have had enough of this type of hate based upon somebody’s practice of religion or somebody’s national origin,” he said. “There is an outpouring that is being heard through the people of Pittsburgh right now of where people want to see society move towards.”",Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue Official Prosecutor Suspect News conference Medical examiner U.S. County Emergency service,"Robert Bowers, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, at a news conference on Sunday.","U.S. Attorney Scott Brady, at podium, speaks with members of the media during a news conference in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh on Sunday. | Matt Rourke/AP Photo Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Officials : Shooter in synagogue attack spoke of killing Jews Local and federal law enforcement officials said Sunday that the man accused of killing 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue entered the building Saturday morning making statements about genocide and his desire to kill Jewish people as congregants were in the middle of worship.","u.s. attorney scott brady, at podium, speaks with members of the media during a news conference in the aftermath of a deadly shooting at the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh on sunday. the u.s. attorney for the western district of pennsylvania, told reporters during a sunday morning news conference of the attack is a place where a community comes together to celebrate what they hold most sacred,000 jewish community. advertisement. robert bowers, 46, entered the tree on saturday armed with three glock handguns and an ar-15 assault rifle. bowers's social media profiles rife with anti-semitic views on which he reportedly wrote that jews are ordering the",1,1,6,99,5,0,0,99.0,0,99

A new survey by the Pew Research Center shows that 57 percent of US teenagers are worried that a shooting could take place at their own school — and one in four are “very worried” about the chance. Hispanic and black kids are the most concerned. Three-quarters of Latino teens said they were worried, and 60 percent of black teens surveyed were worried about the possibility. Researchers conducted the survey after the February 14 shooting in Parkland, Florida, that killed 17 people. They talked to teens ages 13 to 17 and parents with children in the same age range. It turns out the kids are almost as afraid as parents about the chance of a gunman opening fire in their classrooms. About 63 percent of parents said they were worried. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in February has reignited the debate about how to keep children safe from a future attack, with President Trump and gun rights activists saying the best solution is to let teachers carry guns. Most teens reject that idea — especially black teens. Overall, teens thought the most effective measures were to prevent people with mental illness from buying guns and to improve mental health screening and treatment. A smaller majority also thought metal detectors in schools and a ban on assault-style weapons would be helpful. In response to the Parkland shooting, Florida passed a law that incorporates some of those measures — such as expanding mental health services and regulations — but it doesn’t ban assault-style weapons like the AR-15 used in the shooting. Members of Congress passed their own school safety bill in March, though it only focuses on increasing security and safety training for students and school staff.

But when police arrived on the scene, they shot and killed Bradford, issuing a now-retracted statement incorrectly identifying the young man as the gunman. Now, the local police department is suggesting that Bradford would be alive if he hadn’t been carrying his licensed firearm. Police in Hoover, Alabama, initially praised the “heroic” officers involved in the shooting of Bradford, who they claimed had shot an 18-year-old man following a dispute and struck a 12-year-old girl with a stray bullet. But a day later, the police department said that while it was possible Bradford was involved “in some aspect of the altercation,” he did not fire the shots that started the mall incident. As Vox’s German Lopez explains, Bradford did appear to have a gun. But he was licensed to carry a firearm, and it’s not illegal in Alabama to carry a gun in public. Witnesses have also told a lawyer representing Bradford’s family that, contrary to the official police account of the incident, Bradford never drew his weapon. But the Hoover Police Department is sticking to its story: “We can say with certainty Mr. Bradford brandished a gun during the seconds following the gunshots, which instantly heightened the sense of threat to approaching police officers responding to the chaotic scene,” the department said in a Monday morning statement. Later in the day, the department attempted to clarify these remarks, issuing a second statement saying that “the word ‘brandish’ was used because Mr. Bradford had a gun in his hand as police officers responded to the active shooter situation.” The officer involved in the shooting has not been named and has been placed on administrative leave. While the police department argues that the shooting was a tragic mistake stemming from a reasonable fear, Bradford’s family says the incident is rooted in racial profiling: that police fired immediately upon seeing a young black man with a gun, despite the fact that his gun was legal and he might have been trying to help others. According to local news reports, “Several shoppers were seen with their guns drawn” as the mall shooting unfolded. While reports have noted that the mall itself prohibited weapons, it is unclear if that ban was ever enforced. Officers “saw a black man with a gun and he made his determination that he must be a criminal,” civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the family, said during a Sunday press conference. Crump says that witnesses saw Bradford trying to get people away from the initial shooting, and that he kept his gun in his waistband. The family has called for video of the shooting to be released. Bradford’s family says his death is merely the latest in a series of incidents in which a black man who was lawfully armed was killed by police. They have a point: There have been several high-profile cases of black gun owners finding themselves in danger when interacting with police. The Alabama mall shooting is the latest incident to raise questions about the rights of black gun owners The police department’s recent statements about Bradford, coupled with the fact that Bradford lawfully owned his gun, has called attention to the ways that black gun owners are often viewed with suspicion and treated as threats. The topic was most recently in the news in early November after the shooting of Jemel Roberson, a black security guard who stopped a bar shootout, only to be killed by a responding police officer. Bradford’s family argues that, much like Roberson, their loved one was also denied the ability to be seen as a “good guy with a gun.” ”The pattern in America is if there’s a good guy with a gun and he happens to be black, police don’t see him as a good guy,” Crump said over the weekend. The deaths of Bradford and Roberson are two of the latest in recent years where a black gun owner was fatally shot by police. In July 2016, after telling a Minnesota police officer that he was carrying a legal firearm when he was pulled over, Philando Castile was shot while reaching for his wallet. In July 2018, Harith Augustus, a black barber working in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood, was shot by Chicago police after an officer stopped the man and questioned him for “exhibiting characteristics of an armed person.” Video showed Augustus attempting to show an officer what appeared to be an Illinois firearm owner’s ID, before being startled by an officer attempting to grab him from behind. In other cases — like that of John Crawford, who was walking around a Walmart with an air rifle in 2014, and Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old shot while holding a toy pellet gun — police officers have opened fire on black people who weren’t actually holding firearms at all. The shootings have fueled concerns among black gun owners. Despite laws protecting gun rights and ownership, black gun owners say they aren’t as free to exercise these rights. “I choose to own guns for self-defense,” Louis Dennard, director of the National African American Gun Association’s Minnesota chapter, told Vox in 2017. “But that doesn’t automatically mean I’m safer when I’m armed — especially if I am stopped by police.” “We’re being killed because we’re exercising our right in a legal, moral and ethical manner,” NAAGA vice president Douglas Jefferson told Mic shortly after Roberson’s shooting. “The right to bear arms is a right we’re supposed to have on paper, but in practice, it’s being curtailed. You do not have the right if it’s not being universally respected.” It’s an issue that dates back decades, but it’s seeing new attention as gun ownership among African Americans increases and national attention to racial disparities in police shootings remains high. The issue has led to criticisms of groups like the National Rifle Association for their reluctance to jump into discussions of police shootings involving black gun owners, and has spurred the creation of groups like the NAAGA — the National African American Gun Association — which aims to fill a gap for black gun owners whose policy needs aren’t being addressed by higher-profile advocacy groups. With Bradford’s death, it is likely that these discussions will continue. “My son always respected the police and if you would have given a command when you came around that corner, say freeze, drop your weapon, he would have complied with your order,” Emantic Bradford Sr. recently told reporters.",Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Riverchase Galleria Shooting of Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Shopping Centre Shooting Birmingham Gun Firearm Police officer Suspect,"A memorial for the shooting victims at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Ala., on Monday.","When Emantic “E.J.” Fitzgerald Bradford Jr., a 21-year-old black man, heard gunfire at Alabama’s Riverchase Galleria mall on Thanksgiving night , he tried to flee.","police in alabama initially praised a 21-year-old black man with a gun in hoover, alabama. the gunman was licensed to carry a firearm, and it’s german lopez. the department says it is sticking to its story of the incident, bradford never drew his weapon. police say the shooting was a tragic mistake stemming from a reasonable fear, bradford's family says the incident is rooted in racial profiling",1,2,6,99,8,1,1,99.0,0,99

Here’s why doctors disagree,"Frustration is mounting in the medical community as the Trump administration again points to mental illness in response to yet another mass shooting. “The concept that mental illness is a precursor to violent behavior is nonsense,” said Dr. Louis Kraus, forensic psychiatry chief at Chicago’s Rush University Medical College. “The vast majority of gun violence is not attributable to mental illness.” Nikolas Cruz, the 19-year-old charged with killing 17 people on Valentine’s Day at his former high school in Parkland, Florida has been described by students as a loner with troubling behavior who had been kicked out of school. His mother recently died and Cruz had been staying with family friends. “The vast majority of gun violence is not attributable to mental illness.” Since the shooting, his mental health has been the focus of President Donald Trump’s comments. And on a Thursday call with reporters, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said the administration is committed to addressing serious mental illness and that his agency “will be laser-focused on this issue in the days, weeks, and months to come.” Mental health professionals welcome more resources and attention, but they say the administration is ignoring the real problem — easy access to guns, particularly the kind of high-powered highly lethal assault weapons used in many of the most recent mass shootings. “Even for those who manage to survive gun violence involving these weapons, the severity and lasting impact of their wounds, disabilities and treatment leads to devastating consequences,” American Medical Association President David Barbe wrote in an online column after the shooting. “We are not talking about Second Amendment rights or restricting your ability to own a firearm. We are talking about a public health crisis that our Congress has failed to address. This must end,” Barbe wrote. Better access to mental health care, including for those who might be prone to violence, is important, but “to blame this all just on mental illness is not sufficient,” he said in an interview Friday. The AMA has supported efforts to boost gun violence research, ban assault weapons and to restrict access to automatic weapons. Barbe wrote in his column that federally funded research is crucial to address an “urgent health crisis.” Under gun industry pressure, U.S. government research on firearm violence has been limited for decades. Under gun industry pressure, U.S. government research on firearm violence has been limited for decades. The American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and four other medical associations issued a joint statement Friday urging comprehensive action by Trump and Congress, including labeling gun violence a national public health epidemic. The groups’ recommendations include limits on high-powered, rapid-fire weapons designed to kill and funding gun violence research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to the CDC, there were about 38,000 U.S. gun deaths in 2016, slightly more than the number of people who died in car crashes. “The families of the victims in Parkland and all those whose lives have been impacted by daily acts of gun violence deserve more than our thoughts and prayers. They need action from the highest levels of our government to stop this epidemic of gun violence now,” the groups said in a statement. The American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Osteopathic Association contributed to the statement. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Sunday that Trump is working with senators on a bill designed to improve criminal background checks. “While discussions are ongoing and revisions are being considered, the President is supportive of efforts to improve the Federal background check system,” she said. Florida’s Republican governor, Rick Scott, a Trump ally, said he had discussed with Trump and GOP leaders how to restrict gun access to the mentally ill. Federal and state laws already attempt to do this, in many cases with a ban on gun ownership for people who have been treated in mental institutions. Kraus noted that a year ago Trump rolled back an Obama-era law that aimed to prevent certain mentally ill people from buying guns. But he suggested that is beside the point. “There’s a great naivete to what the president and the governor are proposing,” Kraus said. A history of violent behavior, alcohol and substance use, and previous criminal behavior are all more pertinent factors to consider. Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of a violence prevention research program at the University of California, Davis, said gun violence restraining order laws in California and Washington are “a much more focused approach.” The laws allow courts to keep guns out of the hands of people who pose threats to themselves or others. “Florida has no such mechanism. Could have prevented this one; there was plenty of advance notice,” Wintemute said.",Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Cyclo-cross Gun violence Gun Violence Gun control  Shooting School shooting,"A memorial to the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Friday.","Frustration is mounting in the medical community as the Trump administration again points to mental illness in response to yet another mass shooting. “The concept that mental illness is a precursor to violent behavior is nonsense,” said Dr. Louis Kraus, forensic psychiatry chief at Chicago’s Rush University Medical College. “The vast majority of gun violence is not attributable to mental illness.”","frustration is mounting in the medical community as the trump administration again points to mental illness in response to yet another mass shooting. dr. louis kraus, forensic psychiatry chief at chicago’s rush university medical college. . the 19-year-old charged with killing 17 people on valentine’s day at his former high school in parkland, florida has been described as a loner with troubling behavior who had been kicked out of school. his mother recently died and cruz had been staying with family friends. on a thursday call with reporters, health and human services secretary alex azar said the administration is committed to addressing serious mental illness",1,2,3,4,11,0,0,0.0,0,0

The vote by the Investment Committee for the California State Teachers’ Retirement System was supported by panel member and state Treasurer John Chiang even though he had asked in October that the system take more immediate action to stop investing in the gun retailers. “If Congress and state houses are either unwilling or unable to pass sensible policies to stop our schoolyards, work sites and places of worship from becoming killing fields then let’s take the battle to where the money is,” Chiang, a candidate for governor, told the Investment Committee before the unanimous vote to adopt the engagement policy. California bans the sale of assault weapons, which are any semiautomatic, centerfire rifle or semiautomatic pistol that lacks a fixed ammunition magazine and has any of a number of parts that include a telescoping stock. The ban includes AK-47s and other military-style rifles. Advertisement The new policy was drafted in the wake of mass shootings in San Bernardino and Orlando, Fla., and more recently at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where a gunman killed 17 students and faculty in February. CalSTRS’ move follows recent actions by several Wall Street firms, including the nation’s largest money manager, to employ their financial heft to push for stricter gun laws. BlackRock Inc., with $6.3 trillion of assets under management, plans to remove the stocks of retailers that sell firearms from some of its existing and planned investment funds. And Citigroup Inc. said it would place restrictions on firearms sales for its new retail business clients, including a requirement that they don’t sell guns to someone who hasn’t passed a background check or is under 21. Advertisement Chiang said he and legislators also will pursue a bill to force the larger California Public Employees’ Retirement System to adopt a faster action plan that would eliminate investment in gun sellers that fail to change by July 1, 2021. The policy adopted Wednesday by CalSTRS does not include deadlines for engagement to result in changes. The teachers board voted to hire two full-time employees to try to persuade companies it is invested in to stop selling assault rifles. If that doesn’t work, the retirement system officials will use their proxy voting authority to vote against all members of the company’s governing board. If those two steps fail, CalSTRS would initiate a review process under the new policy to determine whether it should divest from a company and whether that would hurt its ability to pay pension benefits. Advertisement CalSTRS’ $225-billion investment portfolio includes more than $400 million in holdings in Walmart Inc., Kroger Co. and other firms that it contends sell firearms outside California that are banned in the state, according to a staff report. However, the staff report submitted to the board said the two main companies are already making changes. Kroger has indicated it is going to “responsibly phase out sales of firearms and ammunition,” and both it and Walmart have raised the age limit for gun purchases to 21, the report said. In 2015, Walmart stopped selling guns it considered assault rifles, including weapons that accept high-capacity ammunition magazines. Advertisement On Wednesday, Walmart spokesman Casey Staheli said that decision satisfied CalSTRS’ latest demands. “We stopped selling modern sporting rifles in 2015,” he said. Walmart and Kroger took their latest actions after Dick’s Sporting Goods banned gun sales to customers under 21 at its 800 Dick’s stores and 35 Field & Stream outlets — and stopped selling assault-style weapons at Field & Stream — following the Florida high school shooting. The decision by Dick’s, one of the nation’s largest sporting goods retailers, drew praise at the time from Harry M. Keiley, chairman of the Investment Committee and a high school teacher with the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District. “Classrooms are meant to be sacred spaces for our children to learn and grow, where fear and violence have absolutely no place and will not be tolerated,” he said. Advertisement There isn’t uniform agreement, though, at CalSTRS that divestment works. Christopher Ailman, chief investment officer of CalSTRS, said at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills this month that divesting ends any influence an investor might have. “Divestment hasn’t made the world a better place,” he said. Also attending the conference was Vicki Fuller, chief investment officer of the New York State Common Retirement Fund — the third largest public pension plan in the nation — who had the same take. Advertisement “If we divest, we don’t have a place at the table and we don’t change behavior,” Fuller said. “We do need our companies to be thinking long term about how they are going to be able to continue to generate their earnings.” But on Wednesday, the CalSTRS panel heard emotional testimony from current and former teachers who said they have been shaken by the spread of campus gun violence. CalSTRS has an obligation to engage corporate executives to try to make changes in business practices that reduce gun violence, Keiley said. “I’m under no illusion that actions that we take today or into the future will end these horrific acts of murder at the hands of people who are mentally ill using assault weapons, whose only purpose is to kill other human beings,” Keiley said during the board hearing. Advertisement “But to sit back and say that we have done enough, that there’s nothing else we can do, I believe would be a breach of our fiduciary duty,” he added. CalSTRS has taken action before in response to gun violence. After the 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, the teachers’ retirement system adopted a divestment policy for companies that manufacture firearms that are banned in the state.

It’s still unclear what set off the violence near the Galleria shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday, as shoppers were getting an early start on post-Thanksgiving sales. Police said a dispute on the upper concourse escalated into a fight, then a volley of gunfire that struck an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl, both of whom survived. AD Crowds immediately fled from the gunshots, stampeding through the food court, jumping over checkout counters and hiding inside stores. AD If Bradford did draw his weapon in the aftermath of the shooting, as police say, he was one of several people to do so, according to AL.com. It’s unclear whether the weapons came out as part of a group dispute, as police have suggested, or in self-defense. Bradford’s relatives have said he had a concealed-handgun license and may have been trying to help people. The Hoover Police Department did not immediately respond when asked whether Bradford aimed his weapon or simply took it out, or whether the gun was still in view when two uniformed officers working as security guards approached him, and one of them opened fire. AD He died on the tile between a GameStop and a Footaction, blood pooled around his head. In time, more officers gathered around the body, and several onlookers took pictures. ""That boy didn’t shoot at nobody,” a man in the corridor said as he filmed. AD “The shooter is down at this time,” an emergency dispatcher announced on the radio. After police backed away from their claim that Bradford shot anyone, his parents hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who has previously represented the families of black shooting victims such as Stephon Clark and Trayvon Martin. The attorney demanded police footage of the shooting be released at a news conference on Sunday. He said Bradford was shot in the face, then interrupted his speech as a woman behind him collapsed in grief. AD Bradford is one of more than 850 people shot and killed by police in the United States this year, according to a Washington Post database, and the latest of many black men whose deaths have led to accusations of systemic racism under U.S. law. He grew up near Birmingham and joined the Army last year, though he left before completing advanced training. At a protest outside the mall on Saturday, relatives said Bradford recently came home to help care for his father. AD The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency has taken over the investigation and search for the shooter, and it has been given body camera footage and other evidence from the mall, police said Monday. In a statement, the agency said it would eventually turn over its findings to the district attorney’s office.

Greg Abbott (R) on Monday canceled a shotgun giveaway it had continued to promote days after a shooter opened fire at a high school in the state. Abbott said Friday that lawmakers needed to “do more than just pray for victims and their families” after authorities reported that a 17-year-old student had killed 10 people and wounded 13 others at Santa Fe High School. “It’s time in Texas that we take action to step up and make sure this tragedy is never repeated ever again,” Abbott said at a press conference, where he noted that the suspected shooter used a shotgun and .38-caliber revolver he had obtained from his father. But Abbott’s promised “action” didn’t appear to include dropping his campaign’s shotgun giveaway contest, outraged Twitter users noted over the weekend. If politicians like Greg Abbott spent as much time talking about safe storage and risks of easily accessible guns in the home as they did pandering to the NRA, we might actually save some lives.

896,896,90446,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-mass-shooting-bills-california-20180905-story.html,"Stunned by a surge in mass shootings, California lawmakers send nine gun-control bills to the governor","Nearly 30 years after California became the first state to ban the sale of assault weapons and embarked on a path toward the strictest firearm laws in the nation, legislators have sent Gov. Jerry Brown nine new gun-control bills in response to a surge in mass shootings. The action by the Legislature was applauded more than 3,000 miles away in Parkland, Fla., where a 19-year-old gunman killed 17 students and employees at a high school in February. Among the legislation waiting approval by Brown are proposals to lift the age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21, and to prohibit the purchase of more than one long gun a month. “If we had these bills in place in Florida, then I would not have had to go through this tragedy and lose some of my friends,” said Sari Kaufman, 16, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who is now an activist with Students Demand Action, a part of the national group Everytown for Gun Safety. “I’m proud to see California pass this kind of legislation, and I hope to see other states follow suit,” she said. Advertisement Legislators also approved bills that would create lifetime bans on gun ownership for those convicted of domestic violence or who are involuntarily hospitalized for mental illness twice in a year; make it tougher to be licensed to carry a concealed firearm; and strengthen a law prohibiting multi-burst trigger devices called bump stocks, used in 2017 by a gunman in Las Vegas who killed 58 people and injured hundreds more. Lawmakers also approved a bill that would allow teachers and employers to petition the courts to have guns confiscated from people who are a danger to themselves and others. Assemblyman Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) said lessons learned after the Parkland shooting helped him draft that bill. Coverage of California politics » Advertisement “Prior to February’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, teachers and administrators expressed increasing concern about the gunman’s behavior at school,” Ting said. “We need to give California schools more tools to prevent another campus tragedy.” Republican lawmakers advocating for gun owners said the proposed laws were an overreaction to isolated incidents that will not reduce gun violence, and will infringe on constitutional rights. State Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber) said during one floor debate that the majority party was engaging in a larger campaign to “disarm the law-abiding.” He was particularly opposed to Ting’s bill. Nielsen said the proposal raises the possibility that people will seek restraining orders based on bias or “irrational fear” of a co-worker. ”I view this as another attack on our 2nd Amendment rights,” he said. Advertisement Sen. Joel Anderson (R-Alpine) said he agrees with concerns raised by the American Civil Liberties Union that the proposal failed to give gun owners a right to first argue their case for keeping firearms to a court. “This bill poses a significant threat to our civil liberties,” Anderson said. The bill that would prohibit Californians from buying more than one rifle or shotgun in any 30-day period drew opposition from groups including the National Rifle Assn. and Outdoor Sportsmen’s Coalition. “Firearms ownership by individuals is a constitutionally protected right of all adults,” the coalition said in a statement to lawmakers. “Limiting all adults to a maximum of one rifle or shotgun purchase per month will not solve crime and mental health problems.” Advertisement A measure sent to the governor that would require those seeking concealed weapon permits to complete at least eight hours of safety classes and pass a live-fire test was denounced by the Firearms Policy Coalition, which advocates for gun owners. The requirement “casually enacts a burdensome new mandate and then leaves it up to hundreds of different law enforcement agencies to determine how it should be interpreted and applied,” the policy coalition said. California has the strictest gun laws in the country and has pioneered many rules, becoming the first state to ban assault weapons in 1989 after a shooting at a Stockton elementary school left five students dead. In 2016, lawmakers expanded restrictions on assault weapons amid public outrage over a terrorist attack a year earlier that left 14 dead and 24 injured in San Bernardino. Advertisement Brown, who has acknowledged owning a rifle, has approved stricter rules in the past on assault rifles and large-capacity ammunition magazines, but he vetoed a bill in 2015 that would have barred the purchase of more than one long gun a month. “Given California’s stringent laws restricting gun ownership, I do not believe this additional restriction is needed,” he wrote that year. During hours of debate by the two legislative houses on the various bills, California legislators specifically credited the student activists from Parkland and elsewhere who marched in Washington, D.C., and at statehouses across the country to demand that more be done to reduce gun violence. In introducing the bill that would raise the age limit for buying long guns, Sen. Anthony Portantino (D- La Cañada Flintridge) gave credit to the activists such as Sari. Advertisement “Out of respect for young people across our country who are demanding action we must answer their plea for help,” he said. The rifle used in the Parkland shooting is already restricted in California as an assault weapon. The approval of the age limit bill followed the lead of Florida, which enacted a similar law in March, shortly after the Parkland shooting. Sari was part of a group of Parkland students who went to the Florida state Capitol in Tallahassee and successfully lobbied legislators to pass the new age limit for gun purchases. Advertisement She said she hopes Brown, who is a Democrat, follows the lead of Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott in enacting stricter gun laws. “My message to [Brown] would be that he should encourage other states to the do the same and be sure that he signs the bills because it’s really how to increase safety,” Sari said. patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com Twitter: @mcgreevy99",Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Shooting Mass shooting Nikolas Cruz School shooting Gun control Gun Alyssa Alhadeff Murder,"A sign outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and employees were killed in February.","Nearly 30 years after California became the first state to ban the sale of assault weapons and embarked on a path toward the strictest firearm laws in the nation, legislators have sent Gov.

The attorney who represented a woman who was harassed by alleged Maryland newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos from 2009 to 2011 described him as a ""dangerous person."" Nearly seven years ago, Ramos pleaded guilty to a criminal harassment charge, court documents filed in the District Court of Maryland in Anne Arundel County show. Ramos, now 38, had befriended the woman on Facebook in 2009 and used information he gathered from the social media platform to attack her, Brennan McCarthy told ABC News. ""He would tell her to do things like hang herself,"" McCarthy said. ""He wrote a letter to her [employer] stating that they should fire her because she's a 'bipolar drunkard.' He did terrible things to this woman."" On Thursday, Ramos allegedly entered 888 Bestgate Road, the building that houses the newsroom for the Capital Gazette, and opened fire on employees for the local newspaper, killing five people, according to the Anne Arundel Police Department. The 888 Bestgate Road building is seen after police received reports of multiple people being shot at The Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Md., June 28, 2018. Jose Luis Magana/AP In 2012, Ramos had filed a defamation lawsuit against the Capital Gazette following a story about the harassment case, former editor and publisher Tom Marquardt told ABC News. The article, which was written in 2011, stated that Ramos had reached out to a former high school classmate on Facebook, asking for help because he was having some issues. The woman, who was not named in the story, tried to help and suggested that he seek counseling. ""That sparked months of emails in which Ramos alternately asked for help, called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself,"" the article said. Jarrod Ramos, 38, of Laurel, Maryland, is seen in this undated mug shot. Anne Arundel Police A judge placed Ramos on 18 months of supervised probation and ordered him to continue therapy and refrain from any further contact with the woman or her family, the court documents show. Ramos claimed he was defamed in the lawsuit against the Capital Gazette, which named Marquardt as well as the reporter who wrote it. A few months later, Ramos filed another complaint that added a charge of invasion of privacy. The case was ultimately dismissed. Marquardt had once received a death threat from Ramos and alerted authorities, but there was not enough evidence to file charges against him, he said. McCarthy described Ramos as ""incredibly angry."" ""The malice dripped off this man in court,"" he said. McCarthy was so affected by Ramos that he began to fear for his own life as well. Brennan McCarthy, the attorney who represented a woman who Maryland shooting suspect Jarrod Ramos had stalked from 2009 to 2011, described him to ABC News as a ""dangerous person."" ABC News After McCarthy got a second protective order for his client and agreed to accept all pleadings and correspondence on her behalf, Ramos allegedly began to harass him too. ""He then started stalking me, my Facebook feed, my own personal things,"" he said. ""...I have no doubt that he was on my street, and it was a very scary situation."" Each morning when he wakes up, McCarthy says se looks out the window to make sure Ramos isn't near his home. He still does it to this day, as does the woman he stalked, he said. ""He left that sort of impression on me,"" he said. ""This is a very dangerous person."" Steve Schuh, county executive of Anne Arundel County, holds a copy of The Capital Gazette near the scene of a shooting at the newspaper's office, June 29, 2018, in Annapolis, Md. Patrick Semansky/AP McCarthy also said that Ramos was ""smart enough to walk the edge so that he did not quite violate the law."" ""He would say things, like, for instance, 'Mr. McCarthy, wouldn't it be so sad if you were to be run over today and die bleeding in your own driveway, and if, perhaps, I might have been in the truck?' It's not a direct threat. It's a referential threat.'"" The woman whom Ramos stalked was so frightened by him that when she left the state, she didn't leave a forwarding address, and she alerted the local sheriff's office to Ramos in case he went looking for her, McCarthy said. ""She still has her gun,"" he said. ""...She's still scared."" Police stand watch outside the Robert F. Sweeney District Court in Annapolis, Maryland, on June 29, 2018, where suspected shooter Jarrod Ramos is expected to appear for a bond hearing.

A white man who was captured on surveillance video stepping out of his house to fire upon a black teen who had knocked on his door to ask for directions, has been found guilty by a Michigan jury. Jeffrey Zeigler, 53, was convicted of assault with intent to do great bodily harm and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. He initially had been charged with assault to commit attempted murder. In a Pontiac courtroom Friday, Rob Morad, Jeffrey Zeigler's defense lawyer, had said in closing statements that the former firefighter did not intend to harm then-14-year-old Brennan Walker during the incident in April. Around 8 a.m. on April 12, Walker was attempting to walk to Rochester High School after missing the bus when he found himself lost and knocked on Zeigler's door in Rochester Hills. He encountered Jeffrey Zeigler's wife, Dana Zeigler, who started screaming after mistaking him for a burglar. ""You can see on the video, ladies and gentlemen, too when he's on the porch, Mr. Zeigler does appear to slip. ... His right hand is barely even on the gun when the gun goes off. You can tell, he doesn't have control of that gun,"" Morad said. ""He wasn't trying to kill him when that gun went off."" However, assistant prosecutor Kelly Collins countered in her closing argument, saying, ""Just because he wasn't successful, doesn't negate what his intent was."" In April, Walker described his encounter with Dana Zeigler. ""I knocked on her door a few times and she came down yelling at me before I could say anything and she thought I was trying to break into her house,"" Walker told ABC Detroit affiliate WXYZ-TV in April. ""I was trying to explain to her that I wanted to get directions to go to my school. I told her, ‘No, I go to Rochester High; I’m just looking for directions to Rochester High.’"" In court, Dana Zeigler testified that she saw a black person at her door that day and started screaming. ""I was screaming as loud as I possibly could, saying somebody is breaking into my house."" she said. ""I screamed at him and I asked him what he was doing there. He tells me that he is going to school and at that point he approaches the door, forward momentum, comes forward, opens the screen door, and puts his hand on the door handle again, as though he's coming into my house."" ""Number one, he didn't look like a child. He was a rather big man standing there, and also, if he was going to school, we have no schools in our area,"" she said. A 911 call summoned Oakland County Sheriff's Office deputies to the Ziegler home in what was described as an attempted break-in. In April, during a court appearance, Jeffrey Ziegler, a retiree of the Detroit Fire Department and on disability for a 2014 job-related injury, said he was asleep in bed ""when my wife started screaming and crying."" The surveillance video shown this week in court showed Jeffrey Zeigler, dressed only in pants, exiting his house and shooting once at Walker as the teen runs away. Deputies at the scene described the weapon as a ""12-gauge shotgun."" Jeffrey Zeigler also testified in court this week, saying that he was not trying to kill Walker that day. ""I wanted to fire more up in the air, more towards my shoulder, and I didn't get the chance to because like I said, it was slippery, and I didn't have a good grip on the gun. ... I felt extremely remorseful. And I was, I was just shocked,"" he said. When asked in court whether he'd handle the situation differently with Walker, Jeffrey Zeigler said, ""Absolutely."" ""I would have given him a ride to school,"" he said. Walker was not struck by the bullet fired by Jeffrey Zeigler's gun. ""I saw him holding it (the gun) like this through the window and I guess I put my hand up. I don’t really remember. And I started to run. I looked back behind me; I saw him aiming at me and I turned back. I turned back and I heard the gunshot. And I tried to run faster,"" Walker said in April. On Friday, Morad reminded jurors that the Zieglers had experienced a number of break-ins. ""It's a very disheartening feeling when you're a victim,"" Morad said Friday. ""Somebody violates the sanctity of your home, comes into your home, when you are actually at home, certainly makes you feel very unsafe and unsettled. ... Mrs. Ziegler was unsettled that day, for sure, because she felt that somebody was coming into her home like it had happened before. ... That's why she screamed."" Ziegler had pleaded not guilty in the case. Sentencing was scheduled for Nov. 18. ABC News' M.L.

In a paper that had not yet been published, Lankford conducted a statistical analysis of the total number of public mass shooters per country from 1966 to 2012 in 171 countries and controlled for the national population size. He said his data showed the United States had significantly more mass shooters, with 90 between 1966 and 2012, compared with 202 in the rest of the world. AD AD Now there's a study that claims to undermine Lankford's research, generating headlines in right-leaning media. The Fact Checker raised questions at the time about Lankford's findings, so we decided it was worth revisiting the issue. The Facts The FBI does not officially define “mass shooting” and does not use the term in Uniform Crime Report records. In the 1980s, the FBI established a definition for “mass murder” as “four or more victims slain, in one event, in one location,” and the offender is not included in the victim count if the shooter committed suicide or was killed in a justifiable homicide, according to a Congressional Research Service report detailing the definitions. AD But such definitions are in dispute. The 1998 shooting at Thurston High School in Springfield, Ore., which had two fatalities and 25 people wounded, would not qualify under the FBI definition but still might seem like a mass shooting to others. In recent years, federal authorities have tended to speak of “active shooters” when three or more people are shot, not just killed. AD Using the four-person-killed definition, Lankford found that the United States had far more mass shooters (90 shooters in the 46 years, or 31 percent of the total) than the other countries, which averaged 1.7 public mass shooter per country. His research excluded gang-related shootings, drive-by shootings, hostage-taking incidents, robberies and acts of genocide or terrorism. At the time, he declined to provide The Fact Checker with the underlying data on the worldwide shootings he had collected. Once he published the study, in 2016, he still declined to release the data. He would only say it was based on a report from the New York City police department and an FBI report, as well as a survey of news reports overseas. AD In his study, Lankford only specifies the U.S. number of shooters (90) in comparison to the only other countries that he said had shooters in the double digits: the Philippines (18), Russia (15), Yemen (11), and France (10). AD Lankford’s research has been widely cited but has been disputed by advocates of gun rights. John R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, recently published a new study that claims to upend Lankford’s findings. Lott primarily relied on data obtained from the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and then supplemented it with research of foreign news accounts. Lott said that he found 1,491 mass public shootings worldwide in a shorter time period — between 1998 and 2012 — and that fewer than 3 percent were in the United States. Compared to Lankford’s 31 percent of all shooters, Lott calculated that the United States produced fewer than 1.43 percent of the mass public shooters. (He counted a total of 43 shooters in the United States between 1998 and 2012.) Overseas, ""We find at least fifteen times more mass public shooters than Lankford in less than a third the number of years,"" he wrote. AD Lott has a controversial reputation. Jaclyn Schildkraut, associate professor at the State University of New York at Oswego and co-author of “Mass Shootings: Media, Myths, and Realities,” said her review of Lott’s report suggests he “drastically inflated the number of international shootings and minimized the context of the U.S. mass shootings picture.” She said his count of 43 incidents in the United States was too low; her count for the same period, with a different definition for mass shooting, is 188. Lott said he used the same definition as indicated by Lankford in his report. AD Unlike Lankford, Lott has released all of his data in nearly 500 pages of appendixes so people can reach their own conclusions. Lankford declined a request to release his research or to discuss in any way his findings in comparison to Lott’s report. (Update, April 1: Lankford released his data.) However, in an email exchange with The Fact Checker, Lankford acknowledged the Mumbai attack in 2008 that killed 168 people was not included in his overseas tally. When The Fact Checker spotted the Mumbai attack on Lott’s list, we asked Lott to remove terrorism cases from the totals for the four countries listed by Lankford — the Philippines, Russia, Yemen and France. Our hope was to provide as much an apples-to-apples comparison as possible. AD Without terrorism cases, Lott’s count of shooters fell dramatically. In the Philippines, the number of shooters fell from 120 to 11, in Russia from 65 to 21 and in Yemen from 65 to 3. Only France did not have a significant decline, going from 5 to 4. This is for the 1998-2012 period, and with the exception of Russia, the number of shooters is lower than Lankford’s calculations for 1966-2012. AD Drilling down into some of the individual incidents that were left on Lott's list, we found several more that could be called into question: five in Russia and three in the Philippines. So we went back to Lott with our concerns. Below is each case, with Lott's responses. The exchange helps shed light on how much these numbers can turn on definitions and judgment calls. March 18, 2000: ""At a bus station in Stavropol, police patrol decided to check a bag belonging to the brothers Murat and Umar Salpagarov and Umar opened fire, killing two police officers and two women."" Our objection: This does not seem like a public mass shooting/active shooting if the shooting occurred because of the police search. AD Lott's response: The murderer ""ran out of the police department's office and started shooting at people inside the bus station's building,” the news report said. AD Feb. 5, 2002: ""Two Russian paratroopers who deserted their base killed nine people before being shot to death by police overnight in Tatarstan.“ Our objection: Should the violence of deserters be categorized in the same category as public mass shooters? Lott's response: The disgruntled paratroopers killed four civilians and five police officers; their disillusionment with the military does not appear relevant to disqualifying the incident as a mass public shooting Sept. 6, 2004: ""Three criminals shot and killed four people in the Snezhinka cafe-bar in Surgut, Russia."" Our objection: Was this a robbery, a hate crime or more akin to gang violence? AD Lott's response: Three unidentified criminals armed with automatic weapons without warning started firing wildly on people in the Snezhinka cafe-bar. A news report says this was possibly a drunken quarrel but police do not exclude the ""response"" of the Russian population to the hostage-taking in Beslan, since the visitors of this cafe are mainly from the Caucasus. “If a drunk person uses a machine gun to randomly shoot up people (and the [Global Terrorism Database] says that this is neither terrorism nor insurgency or guerrilla related), it would appear to fit the type of case that you are still willing to include,” he said. “If you think that it is revenge for the Beslan school massacre where 385 people were shot to death and something over 500 more were wounded, I leave it to you whether you want to count it as terrorism.” AD Sept. 17, 2005: ""Three Russian deserters have been captured after a shooting spree that left three army troops and three police officers dead.” Our objection: Should the violence of deserters be categorized in the same category as public mass shooters? Lott's response: “This is more akin to a case of workplace violence. This shooting wasn’t directly related to a military conflict, and the shooters were no longer soldiers.” AD Sept. 30, 2007: ""An argument [in Dagastan] between creditors and debtors reportedly deteriorated into a shooting spree,"" and nine people, including a local police officer, were killed. Our objection: This does not seem like a public mass shooting/active shooting; it sounds as though it has more in common with a robbery or other form of felony mass murder. Lott's response: “Workplace attacks can arise for many reasons. In the U.S., cases include people feeling slighted by others or not getting promotions or getting fired or even disputes over money. This 'shooting spree' didn’t just involve the several people initially involved in the discussion.” AD Aug. 25, 2001: ""Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) members fired on a mini-bus, killing six"" in the Philippines. This seems to be militia or guerrilla attack. Lott's response: This is designated by the GTD as terrorism, not an insurgency, guerrilla or similar attack. Jan. 5, 2005: ""Suspected members of a renegade pro-government militia attacked a group of farmers."" This appears to be militia group behavior. Lott's response: This is designated by the GTD as “other crime,” so not an insurgency, guerrilla, or similar attack, nor is it a terrorist attack. Again, we are relying on the GTD for this classification Nov. 23, 2009: ""Andal Ampatuan, Jr. and his clan (a 'leading Muslim political clan') attacked Esmael Mangudadatu's family members and supporters, 57 people killed ... The Philippines classifies this as a terrorist attack.” This appears to be terrorist group behavior. Lott's response: “We have provided all the info that we had, including that the Philippines classified that as a terrorist attack, but our rule has been to rely on the University of Maryland GTD as the determining factor for whether it is a terrorist attack. Countries can have political reasons for classifying attacks in different ways, and rather than get into a debate on these issues we relied on the GTD. We spent a lot of time talking to the GTD, and they seemed to have good reasons for how they generally classified cases.” Nevertheless, Lott was willing to adjust his calculations of the number of shooters again after these eight cases were removed. With the exception of Russia, the yearly rate turns out to be quite similar for both researchers. Recall that Lott estimated that there were 43 shooters in the 1998-2012 time period in the United States. Lankford count of number of shooters (1966 to 2012): France: 10 (0.212 yearly rate) Philippines: 18 (0.322) Russia: 15 (0.319) Yemen: 11 (0.234) Total: 54 (1.149) Lott count of number of shooters (1998 to 2012), minus terrorism and eight other cases France: 4 (0.2667 yearly rate) Philippines: 5 (0.333) Russia: 9 (0.60) Yemen: 3 (0.20) Total: 21 (1.40) The Bottom Line We appreciate Lott's willingness to recalculate his results based on our questions, as well as his decision to make public the voluminous data he has collected as he tried to replicate Lankford's findings. Lankford has chosen to keep his data set private, which makes it difficult to understand how the two researchers come to such different conclusions. Indeed, Lott was unaware that Lankford did not include the Mumbai attacks in his data set until The Fact Checker learned that from Lankford. (That's because Lankford refused to respond to his queries.) Lott's results changed when he removed cases that might not fit the public's definition of a mass shooting, just as they would change if a different definition of mass shooting is used. A consistent definition of mass shooting — and public databases that display the relevant data — thus are necessary for the two sides of the gun debate to even begin to have a discussion on this issue. Lankford should reveal his dataset so it can receive the same scrutiny as Lott's work. Update, April 1: Lankford published a response to Lott in which he also released his data set. He makes the case that when consistent definitions are used, Lott’s own data confirms Lankford’s findings: The United States has a disproportionate number of public mass shooters — six times — who attack alone. “By definition, firearms are needed for people to commit mass shootings, so in countries where it is easier for dangerous or disturbed individuals to legally purchase firearms—like the United States—there is an increased likelihood of an attack,” Lankford writes.

Diane Black must be watching some crazy violent porn, it seems. (Photo: Aaron Bernstein / Reuters) Does anyone know what kind of porn Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) is watching? Whatever it is, the 67-year-old Black, who is running for governor of Tennessee, said it’s a “big part” of what is driving the spike in school shootings. During a meeting last week with local pastors, Black raised the issue of gun violence in schools and why it keeps happening. “Pornography,” she said. “It’s available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there,” she continued. “All of this is available without parental guidance. I think that is a big part of the root cause.” Here’s an audio of her remarks, which she made during a listening session with ministers at Safe Harbor of Clarksville, Tennessee. Black didn’t clarify what it is about porn that she thinks is leading to school massacres. Her congressional spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond naughty movies, Black said school shootings are on the rise because of the “deterioration of the family,” mental illness and violent movies. There have been 23 shootings of some type this year on the campuses of K-12 schools or colleges. Of those at the K-12 schools, nine involved a gun being discharged and people being injured or killed, including a Friday shooting in Indiana school that left a teacher and a student injured. Contrary to Black’s take, experts say poor social, economic and cultural conditions are primary drivers of gun violence. Enacting policies to improve those conditions for people, along with reducing access to firearms, would go a long way in stemming mass shootings, they say. These actions are “far more effective than all the police, doctors and hospitals combined, and intervening only after tragedies have struck,” said professors James Gilligan of New York University and Bandy Lee of Yale University, both experts on violence.

Images from a now-deleted social media account, the validity of which Cruz’s classmates confirmed to the Miami Herald , show the teenager, accused of gunning down 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday, posing with a number of different weapons and discussing gun modifications. Covering his face with bandanas and wearing different hats, Cruz can be seen in the images posted on social media holding a large knife with a molded grip. In another, he holds three hunting knives between his fingers in a claw. In other even more troubling screenshots, Cruz, a former student at Stoneman Douglas, can be seen discussing making modifications to a rifle and asking about background checks. On Wednesday, police said, the teenager was armed with an AR-15 rifle as he carried out the attack. People wait for loved ones as they are brought out of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, after a shooting at the school that killed at least 17 people on February 14.

A second Instagram page, with the handle 'nikolas annihilator,"""" was identified by the website H eavy . The account has also been removed from the social media platform and cannot be verified as belonging to Cruz. Cruz’s former classmates have said he was a troubled student. He had been expelled from the Parkland school for unspecified disciplinary reasons, Reuters reported . 'He was crazy about guns,' Chad Williams, 18, a senior at the high school said. 'He was kind of an outcast. He didn’t have many friends. He would do anything crazy for a laugh, but he was trouble.' According to the Miami Herald , some students characterized Cruz as exactly the kind of student who would carry out a school shooting. 'If you were to pick one person you might predict in the future would shoot up a school or do this, it would be this kid,' John Crescitelli, one parent said, quoting his son. Teachers at the school had also been warned Cruz could be dangerous. 'We were told last year that he wasn’t allowed on campus with a backpack on him,' math teacher Jim Gard said.

The suspect in a mass shooting that left two people dead and 12 with bullet wounds at a Madden 19 e-games tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday, carried two handguns and extra ammunition into the contest venue and specifically targeted his competition, authorities said Monday. The two people killed in the shooting allegedly committed by David Katz, 24, inside a back room bar at a Chicago Pizza restaurant in the Jacksonville Landing mall were considered the top two Madden gamers in the world, a competitor wounded in the rampage told ABC News. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News ""The suspect clearly targeted other gamers that were in a back room at the Chicago Pizza participating in this gaming tournament,"" Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said of Katz at a news conference Monday afternoon. ""The suspect walked passed patrons who were in other parts of the business and focused his attention on the gamers."" Meanwhile, court records obtained by ABC News in Baltimore from a divorce and child custody battle between Katz's parents show that Katz was treated in 2011 for mental health issues and that his mother informed the court that her son was suffering from depression and ""affective disorders."" Records also show that David Katz was once prescribed the antidepressants Risperdal and Fluoxetine. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News Sheriff Williams said Katz was armed with two handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9mm, one with a laser scope, on Sunday, but investigators believe he only used one of the weapons in the attack. ""Video surveillance from inside the restaurant clearly shows that this is a single shooter incident and that the suspect took his own life after shooting the victims,"" Williams said. He said Katz purchased both guns legally in Baltimore within the past month. Killed in the shooting were Elijah Clayton, 22, of Woodland Hills, California, and Taylor Robertson, 28, a married father of a young boy from Giles, West Virginia. Another 12 people were wounded in the shooting and a 13th person was injured fleeing the gunfire, Williams said. Police barricade a street near Jacksonville Landing in Jacksonville, Fla.,Aug. 26, 2018. Laura Heald/AP Clayton and Robertson were among the top players of the Madden NFL football e-game, according to EA Sports, publisher of the video game. Robertson -- nicknamed ""SpotMePlzzz"" -- was the defending champion of the Madden Classic, the Super Bowl for Madden gamers, held in Las Vegas. ""These two guys were two of the best Madden players in the world the last couple of years,"" Chris McFarland, a Madden gamer who was grazed in the head during Sunday shooting, told ABC News Monday from a Jacksonville hospital. Williams said Katz's motive for the shooting remains under investigation. In a video from a February 2017 interview Katz, who went by the nickname ""Bread,"" gave to an EA Sports announcer during a Madden regional competition in Buffalo, New York, he seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder for being seeded seventh in the tournament that he ended up winning. David Katz, right, has been identified by Jacksonville police as the suspected shooter at a Madden NFL esports tournament on Sunday, Aug. 26, 2018. Two people were killed and Katz committed suicide, police said. Twitter/@buffalobills ""I don't think of myself as a seventh seed. I think I'm one of the better players,"" Katz said in the interview. Sheriff Williams said Katz's car was located in Jacksonville, and investigators found the hotel room where he was staying. He said both have been searched, but would not disclose if investigators seized any evidence pertinent to the shooting. Charles Spencer, special agent in charge of the FBI's Jacksonville office, said federal agents were also in Baltimore investigating Katz's background. ""We're tracking down where the subject was before he was here [in Jacksonville], where he stayed, who he had contact with,"" Spencer said. ""In Baltimore, our agents are working with the subject's family. His parents, both mother and father, have been fully cooperative with the FBI, so far. They have provided us access to all the records we've requested."" The court records obtained by ABC News also show that in May 2006, David Katz received psychiatric treatment at the Howard County General Hospital in Columbia, Maryland. His father, according to the records, disagreed with medicating his son because antidepressants ""may increase suicidal thoughts in young people.""

The documents also show that David Katz refused treatment. ""It was clear from the testimony of both Mr. and Mrs. Katz that David had an extremely strong negative reaction both to Mrs. Katz taking David Katz to various mental health care professionals and Mrs. Katz giving him psychiatric drugs,"" according to court records detailing a hearing in the Katz's divorce. In April 2005, Katz's mother, Elizabeth Katz, called the police because her son was refusing mental health counseling, according to the records. A lawyer for his father, Richard Katz, argued that David Katz was then ""faced with the prospect of being put in handcuffs by the police,"" according to the records.

He recently sat down with NRA TV host and guns rights activist Colion Noir to defend gun ownership and said he discouraged his children from taking part in the high school walkouts from earlier this month. ""I told my kids on the school walkout: 'I love you but if you walk out that school, walk out my house.'"" The Run The Jewels MC is known for his strong political stances on racism, mass incarceration, and other issues, and while this interview might have caught some by surprise, he's been an outspoken NRA supporter (and member) for quite some time. In Mike's view, the important discussions about gun control should include voices from both sides. He also said that gun owners want violence against children to end, though they disagree on how to achieve that. ""I have worked as a tireless advocate of children and disenfranchised women in my community. And I have also worked with gun groups like Georgians Against Gun Violence [...] If there's a table to be sat at, the gun owner needs to be there, so I try to see the problem from the whole perspective,"" he said in the clip. Mike and the host echoed similar ideas and claimed that though they may be viewed as ""lackeys"" for the NRA, the onus of that title is actually on everyone else. “You’re a lackey of the progressive movement because you’ve never disagreed with the people who tell you what to do,” the rapper explained. The conversation shifted slightly to focus on the March for Our Lives protests, namely regarding the financial support it has received thus far. “Our biggest celebrities are donating millions to a march while our inner-city schools are in deplorable conditions,” said Noir, to which Mike agreed and added, ""Celebrities are told what to do."" He went on to take down not only anti-gun campaigns but shared that he declined to do an anti-bullying drop for an unnamed radio station. ""Your child needs to get punched in the face so he can learn to punch someone back,"" he said. ""You have to develop the aptitude to fight back.

113,113,482,http://www.yahoo.com/news/us-crypto-anarchist-sees-3d-printed-guns-fundamental-040318092.html,US 'crypto-anarchist' sees 3D-printed guns as fundamental right,"Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide. A federal court judge blocked Texan Cody Wilson's website on Tuesday by issuing a temporary injunction. Eight states had sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a ""lone wolf"" gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons. Wilson complied with the judge's order and shut down his Defcad website, which he wanted to turn into the ""WikiLeaks of guns."" But by then, the blueprints he had posted -- after President Donald Trump's administration granted him permission to publish in a settlement to end a five-year legal battle -- had been downloaded thousands of times. ""No matter how badly I win or lose, you can download a gun from the internet,"" Wilson told AFP at the headquarters of Defense Distributed, the company he runs out of a modest factory in Texas capital Austin. ""This attempt by these authorities to go into court and stifle this information drove more people to the website to download it and spread it deeper into the internet."" Sporting a pair of gray jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, the 30-year-old with a close-cropped beard wouldn't appear out of place as a tech executive in Silicon Valley. The ideology he says he is driven by is a defense of the US constitution's first and second amendments -- the rights to free speech and to bear arms. Wilson believes the intense media attention he generated cemented one of his principal goals: to use technology and the spread of gun-making information as a permanent bulwark against any future attempts at gun control in the US. ""We believe that the firearm itself, this implement of violence, is an essential component of force, of sovereignty,"" he says. He concedes that what he has done, and still wants to do, ""offends the conscience"" of some people, but he says ""it's never been illegal in this country to make a firearm -- and the way that you make it shouldn't affect that law."" Story continues - Anarchist philosophy - Wilson subscribes to an anarchist philosophy that the free exchange of ideas on the internet -- in its absolute form -- is a check on government. ""It's a politics that predicted WikiLeaks, predicted Bitcoin, predicted anonymous mail and anonymous communications online,"" he says. The law school dropout has dedicated the last five years of his life to the cause of unfettered online access to gun-making information. ""I'm a publisher. At the end of the day, I do many things, but the main thing that I strive to do is to take my information and put it on the internet,"" he says. Defense Distributed, the company Wilson co-founded in 2013 and currently heads, is more than a publishing firm -- it sells actual firearms products. It has created a machine called the ""Ghost Gunner,"" priced at $2,000. Computer code operates the machine, which carves essential components of various firearms to create weapons without serial numbers. - 'Ghost guns' - Such weapons -- called ""ghost guns"" -- are already being made by those who can properly carve metal components. The ""Ghost Gunner"" takes away the need for advanced skill and creates untraceable weapons. The issue is far from academic. The Los Angeles Police Department last month showcased a trove of ""ghost"" weapons it recovered from gang members. Law enforcement cannot trace these weapons if they are used to commit crimes. That is why lawmakers, law enforcement personnel, gun control groups and even Trump himself expressed everything from panic to skepticism this week when Wilson started distributing blueprints online. Those blueprints included his company's own creation, the ""Liberator"" plastic gun -- a sidearm that resembles something seen on science fiction TV shows. The potential impact of Wilson's publication was worldwide. Any country with uncensored access to the internet could see its gun control measures circumvented with a click of a mouse. ""It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that 3D-printed guns are nothing short of a menace to society,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one,"" Gardiner said after the injunction. Wilson also plans to fight, just as he unsuccessfully fought in the courts for five years. The judge that ordered his website shut plans to hold a hearing on the states' lawsuit next week. Wilson put out a call for donations to fund the legal challenge, but is aware that he may be facing a losing battle. ""I believe that duty demands that I continue to fight it,"" he said, while admitting that ""I think I'll waste a lot of money.""",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distortion, at the company’s headquarters in Austin, Tex.","Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide.

The suspect, Juan David Ortiz, 35, knew all four of the victims he allegedly killed and had gained their trust over a period of time before luring each of them to the outskirts of Laredo, Texas, and shooting them in the head, Chief Federico Garza of the Webb County Sheriff's Office said during a news conference.

""Ortiz targeted all the victims due to their profession and being vulnerable,"" Garza said. ""At one point, Ortiz was able to gain their trust and then viciously shot them."" Webb County District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said the victims were either drug users or sex workers.

Following his arrest early Saturday morning, Ortiz confessed to all of the killings which occurred between Sept. 3 and Sept. 15., according to police. One victim was not identified, pending family notification. The other three, police said, were Claudine Anne Luera, 42, Melissa Ramirez, 29, and Humberto Ortiz, 28.

The woman who escaped from his truck at a gas station ran to a nearby police officer who was gassing up his patrol car, Garza said. ""What we understand here is that the witness had struggled with him,"" Garza said. ""She was trying to get out. She later found that he had a weapon and she was not feeling just right to be with him. She tried to get away once. Then tried to get away twice. And from what I understand, on the second attempt, she was able to jump out through the door ..."" He said Ortiz fled the gas station and drove to his home in Laredo as an all points bulletin was issued for his pickup truck. ""He had numerous weapons. He was loading up all his weapons, thinking that [Department of Public Safety officers] were going to confront him and he was looking at a confrontation,"" Garza said. ""Thank God that didn't happen."" He said that when officers went to Ortiz's house he was no longer there. But about 1 a.m. on Saturday, police spotted his truck at a gas station. Garza said Ortiz had left his weapons inside his truck while he went inside the gas station to use the restroom. When he came out, two troopers were waiting for him, and one attempted to use a stun gun on him. Ortiz ran to a nearby hotel parking lot. ""He was going to do was try to commit suicide by cop,"" Garza said. ""He was going to try to use his phone to make it look like it was a weapon. It didn't happen. He was apprehended without incident."" Alaniz said Ortiz has been charged with four counts of murder, one count of aggravated assault with a gun and unlawful restraint. The prosecutor said that the charges could be elevated to capital murder, depending on the results of the investigation. ""I'm not ready to make that decision at this time,"" Alaniz said.

146,146,238,https://www.yahoo.com/news/unlikely-pair-could-usher-gun-rights-case-u-100905580.html,Unlikely pair could usher gun rights case to U.S. Supreme Court,"By Daniel Trotta (Reuters) - George Young is a Vietnam War veteran who sued the state of Hawaii three times on his own without a lawyer for the right to carry a handgun, and lost each time. Alan Beck is an independent lawyer who took on Young's appeal for free. Last month, the duo won a major victory for gun rights when an appeals court found Hawaii's restrictive handgun law unconstitutional, a ruling that could lead to a landmark decision from the U.S. Supreme Court on the right to bear arms in public. And they did so without the help of the powerful National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby. ""I went around the state of Hawaii and contacted about 17 attorneys and all of them turned me down. They said I would only lose,"" said Young, 68. ""I want to see it through to the end, which is the U.S. Supreme Court."" U.S gun-control advocates favor strict laws like Hawaii's, blaming lax gun laws for excessive gun violence and deadly mass shootings in the United States. The NRA and other gun-rights advocates oppose laws that restrict the constitutional right to bear arms and want the high court to take up a new case, hoping it will expand gun rights outside the home. The Supreme Court has not taken on a major gun-rights case since a pair of cases in 2008 and 2010 in which the court established that the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects an individual's right to keep a gun at home. Hawaii allows only people who work in security or who can demonstrate to law enforcement officials that they have an ""exceptional case"" to carry weapons, concealed or openly. After he left the Army, Young carried a firearm for 17 years as an airport security guard but lost that right after he retired. He failed to convince the County of Hawaii's police chief he deserved a permit, so he sued, saying his constitutional right to bear arms was violated. He filed suits in 2008, 2010 and 2012 to challenge the denials, losing each time. Lacking the means to hire a lawyer for an appeal, Young would normally have had to depend on a star litigator financed by the NRA or a major law firm to take the case pro bono, or free of cost. Story continues Instead Young paired up with Beck, a solo practitioner who learned of Young's story and offered to represent him for free. Beck said he has limited means of his own and that his father has offered to lend him money if needed to keep the case going. ""This covers my pro bono hours for my career. It's worth it. Sometimes you have to do the right thing,"" Beck said. NO NRA HELP Based in California but with family ties in Hawaii, Beck said he took Young's case because he disagreed with the ruling by the U.S. District Court and said Young was denied the leeway that should be afforded to a non-lawyer representing himself. ""I didn't think he got a fair shake,"" Beck said. ""We got to know each other very well. I know his family now. I consider him a good friend as well as a client."" The NRA turned down a request to help with the case, Beck said, declining to elaborate. The NRA was still involved in assisting another lawsuit challenging carry laws when Young filed his suit, which is why the association did not get involved, spokeswoman Amy Hunter said. On July 24, Young scored his first victory. In a 2-1 ruling, a three-judge panel of the normally liberal 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2018/07/24/12-17808.pdf Young has a Second Amendment right to carry a firearm in public. The NRA applauded the ruling. Hawaii has until Sept. 14 to ask the case to be reheard by the same panel or ""en banc"" by a larger number of judges. The state has defended its law by citing the 2008 and 2010 Supreme Court cases, District of Colombia v. Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago. While those rulings were taken as a victory by gun-rights advocates, proponents of gun control say the court also established limits to the Second Amendment. ""Heller was not intended to extend the protections found in the Second Amendment to any area outside the home,"" Hawaii said in a 2013 filing in the case. 'CIRCUIT SPLIT'Some U.S. appeals courts have upheld state laws that greatly restrict gun carry rights while others have struck them down, creating what is known as ""circuit split."" The Supreme Court often hears cases in order to resolve such splits, but it requires four out of nine Supreme Court justices to agree to hear a case. ""As a practical matter, there is indeed a circuit split,"" said Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor. Young, who is part native Hawaiian and part descendant of Japanese plantation workers, became passionate about the issue while teaching his late daughter Tim, who died in a car accident in 2004 at age 21, about the Constitution. ""She was my pet. Of my three children she was the one to follow me everywhere,"" Young said. One day, as they discussed the Constitution, Young was startled when she told him he could not carry a handgun in Hawaii, so he began his quest. ""I made the promise that they cannot take your Second Amendment away,"" Young said. ""So to prove it to her, that's when I started.""

885,885,322,http://www.yahoo.com/news/shooting-suspect-twice-hospitalized-mental-illness-052752901.html,Shooting suspect was able to buy guns despite mental illness,"""BALTIMORE (AP) — The young man who opened fire at a Florida video game tournament had shown abundant signs he was struggling with a mental disorder: He was prescribed an anti-psychotic drug as an adolescent and had been hospitalized at least twice for mental illness. Yet David Katz landed at the foggy intersection of America's mental health and legal systems when it came to buying the two handguns that police say he carried during the attack, which killed two people and wounded 10 others during the """"Madden NFL 19"""" competition in Jacksonville. The rampage ended when the 24-year-old Baltimore man fatally shot himself. Experts say the gunman's history of mental illness apparently would not have stopped him from buying guns in Maryland, where buyers cannot pass a background check if they were either involuntarily committed for any period of time or voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility for at least 30 consecutive days. Court papers filed in his parent's bitter divorce do not clearly indicate whether Katz was hospitalized voluntarily or involuntarily, and the two hospitalizations described in the documents were both shorter than 30 days. In addition, Katz's hospitalizations may have occurred before the Maryland General Assembly revamped the state's firearms laws following the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. """"It appears that these disqualifications did not apply to David Katz,"""" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The Jacksonville shooting is just the latest U.S. case to illustrate the complexities of keeping dangerously unstable people from purchasing guns. A Maryland legislator said the attack highlights the need to review laws governing the length of time someone can be voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility and still pass a background check for firearms. """"That clearly is an area in need of reform,"""" said Democratic Sen. Robert Zirkin, who chairs a Senate committee that handles gun laws. Maryland lawmakers will gather in January for their annual 90-day legislative session in Annapolis, where people are still grieving the loss of five people gunned down at a newspaper office earlier this year. The gunman's attorneys are considering an insanity defense. Under federal law, people are generally prohibited from acquiring guns if they have ever been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility. Nationally, there's no federal requirement for psychiatric hospitals or courts to report involuntary commitments to the FBI for inclusion in a database used for gun-purchase background checks. Some states have their own laws. In Maryland, where Katz purchased a 9mm handgun and .45-caliber handgun, state law requires courts to report to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever people are declared mentally incompetent to stand trial or assigned a guardian because they cannot manage their affairs. In addition, Maryland law requires psychiatric facilities that admit an individual to submit a report to the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. As part of the gun-purchase application, Maryland state police require applicants' written authorization for the state health agency to disclose whether they suffer from a mental disorder, have a history of violent behavior or have been confined for more than 30 consecutive days to a mental health facility. Maryland state troopers are responsible for investigating gun purchases, but for now they are not talking to avoid interfering with the investigation in Jacksonville, spokesman Greg Shipley said. Katz's parents frequently disagreed on how to care for their troubled son, with his father at times claiming his estranged wife was exaggerating symptoms of mental illness. The couple divorced in 2007. The suspect's father, Richard Katz of Baltimore, and his mother, Elizabeth Katz of Columbia, Maryland, did not respond to phone messages from The Associated Press. Efforts to reach them and other relatives at their homes were also unsuccessful. A psychologist once warned a family court that David Katz might become violent. Katz """"could lash out and become so angry that he would hit and hurt his mother,"""" Dr. Paul Berman told the court. The divorce papers in Howard County, Maryland, say Katz started obsessively playing video games as a boy, sometimes refusing to go to school or to bathe. Elizabeth Katz, a toxicologist who worked at the Department of Agriculture, said in court papers that she would confiscate some of her son's gaming equipment after finding him playing games in the wee hours. At one point, she put his gaming controllers in her bedroom behind a locked door and he punched a hole in the door, she said. When a boy, he sometimes """"curled up into a ball,"""" refused to attend school and sobbed, she said. She asserted that her ex-husband, a NASA engineer, instructed David not to take Risperidal — an anti-psychotic medication prescribed to him. In late 2007, Katz was admitted to the Sheppard Pratt mental health system near his Maryland home for about 12 days. Court documents say a psychiatrist at that time administered antidepressants. He later spent about 13 days at Potomac Ridge, a mental health services facility in Rockville. __ Witte reported from Annapolis, Maryland.

(Reuters) - David Ortner adjusted his yarmulke, cocked his pistol and took aim - something he wishes a civilian had done to defend Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue three days ago when Robert Bowers walked in and shot 11 people dead. ""When this happens, you get a wake-up call,"" said Ortner, a 28-year-old owner of an optician shop in Monsey, New York. Ortner was one of nine Jewish men who attended a one-day course on Tuesday at the privately owned Cherev Gidon Israeli Tactical Defense Academy near Scranton, Pennsylvania, a class that was scheduled on Sunday in response to the Pittsburgh synagogue attack. He was there to learn how to use a gun to protect himself and his community and prevent a repeat of Saturday's massacre, the deadliest targeting Jewish people in U.S. history. ""The fact is, we're at war,"" said Yonatan Stern, a veteran officer of the Israel Defense Forces and director of the academy, told his class. ""We want every Jew in America armed."" In the six years since Stern started the academy, demand for firearms training had never been higher than after Saturday's attack. Hundreds of interested students contacted Stern in the last 72 hours. All but three or four were Jewish. The spike in demand follows President Donald Trump's statement that the shooting might have been prevented if the synagogue had employed an armed guard. But many Jews have resisted the idea that having guns in synagogues is the best way to prevent such attacks. Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of the Kansas Interfaith Action, an advocacy organization, said on Tuesday that he did not believe Trump’s call for more armed guards could prevent attacks on places of worship. “What kind of country we're going to be if every house of worship has to have an armed guard?” Rieber said. “I think having less access to that kind of weaponry is going to be much more effective in the long run than having a single armed guard.” Story continues According to Stern, an armed guard at a synagogue is a useful deterrent but not a replacement for armed civilians, since a shooter could kill the armed guard before entering and killing congregants. ""To wait for law enforcement to arrive simply is not the answer,"" Stern said. Some of the students attending the course were card-carrying National Rifle Association members. Some had never fired a gun before. Two worked in schools and wanted to defend Jewish children. Many of them intended to bring guns to their synagogues on the next Sabbath for protection. ""Everybody has to find a way to react; this is my way,"" said Zev Guttman, who said he was scared of guns until Saturday's shooting convinced him he had to be armed. Tuesday's course, held in a log cabin on an outdoor shooting range in rural Honesdale, about 300 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, consisted of active-shooter response drills using handguns and rifles. Students practiced drawing concealed weapons, loading and firing AR-15 rifles at bulls-eye targets. Stern said that it ""touches my heart"" to see his students in training because he knows they will return to their synagogues as a first line of defense.

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the gunman who killed 12 people in a crowded South California bar this week was a ""very, very sick guy,"" as investigators tried to determine what could have motivated the 28-year-old Marine combat veteran. Even as Thousand Oaks, a suburb 40 miles (64 km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, mourned the dead, the city faced a fresh threat on Friday as wildfires raged in the area, forcing thousands of people from their homes. Victims of Wednesday night's rampage in the city of Thousand Oaks included an 18-year-old freshman student at Pepperdine University, a security guard at the bar, a graduate of California Lutheran University and a Marine Corps veteran. Ian David Long, who served with the Marines in Afghanistan, walked into the Borderline Bar and Grill, which was packed with dancing college students, and opened fire, fatally shooting 12 people before apparently killing himself, law enforcement officials said. CNN reported that Long had written on Facebook around the time of the massacre: ""I hope people call me insane ... wouldn't that just be a big ball of irony?"" He added, ""Yeah.. I'm insane, but the only thing you people do after these shootings is 'hopes and prayers'.. and wonder why these keep happening."" Long's Facebook page appears to have since been deleted. ""He is a very sick puppy,"" Trump said of the gunman, speaking at the White House before leaving on a trip to Paris. The FBI was seeking a motive for the country's latest mass shooting. Ventura County Sheriff Geoff Dean told reporters on Thursday that Long may have suffered from PTSD. ""He was a Marine, he was in the war, he served time, he saw some pretty bad things,"" Trump said. ""And a lot of people say he had PTSD and it's a tough deal."" Richard Berge, who lived near Long and looked after his mother's dogs, told Reuters she had told him earlier this year she worried her son might take his own life but did not fear he would hurt her. Story continues The Thousand Oaks massacre took place less than two weeks after a man shot dead 11 worshippers at a Pittsburgh synagogue, fueling the debate over gun ownership in America. One of the dead, Telemachus Orfanos, had survived the mass shooting at a country music concert in October 2017 in Las Vegas that killed 58 people, the worst such incident in modern U.S. history, ABC News said, citing a friend. It was time for politicians to act, Orfanos' mother, Susan Schmidt-Orfanos, told ABC News. ""I don't want prayers. I don't want thoughts,"" she said. ""I want gun control and I hope to God nobody else sends me any more prayers."" The shooting came a day after the election of a Democratic governor who has pushed for tighter gun control in a state that already has some of the strictest firearms laws in the country. 'STILL REELING' The wildfire that started on Thursday has destroyed some homes on the outskirts of Thousand Oaks and forced the mandatory evacuations of 75,000 people, as well as closing some highways. A large plume of smoke grew on the horizon to the northeast of the city on Friday. Andrea Campbell Conant, a public relations executive who grew up in Thousand Oaks, said even as she drove to one of the vigils for the 12 people killed on Wednesday night roads had begun to close. ""It's almost like we haven't had enough time to process how we feel,"" she said in a telephone interview as she described a head-spinning shift from a tear-filled vigil to her and her friends getting calls from relatives who needed help after getting evacuation orders. Although mass shootings have become commonplace in modern American life, Wednesday's carnage still came as a shock to the 127,000 residents of Thousand Oaks, which was named the third safest city in the United States for 2018 by the Niche research company. Heather Wynalda, 47, in Conejo Valley, a few miles west of Thousand Oaks, said her brother's home had burned but he and his family were safe. ""It's just devastating,"" she said via Facebook messenger. ""This community pulled together so beautifully in the midst of yesterday's shooting ... and today, it is being frantically scattered in an effort to escape the fires."" Evacuation centers have been set up in Thousand Oaks, including a teen center where frantic parents awaited news of their children after Wednesday's shooting. Pepperdine University, which held a prayer service in Malibu following the shooting, said Friday it was closing its Malibu and Calabasas campuses due to the wildfires.

The ordinance was approved after an AP story investigating the reselling of confiscated guns. That report concluded that many of the guns sold by the police were used for new crimes. The ordinance to prohibit the sales passed 6-1 Monday. Instead of selling guns that are confiscated, police will have to dispose of them. “Disposing of long guns and assault rifles is a sensible approach,” Councilwoman Candace Mumm told the AP. “Instead of spending time recycling weapons, our police staff can get back to the primary mission of solving crimes and protecting the public.” ADVERTISEMENT Spokane is the second city to ban law enforcement arms sales after the AP's report, following King County in Washington, which passed a similar ordinance on Oct. 2. Between 2011 and 2018, the forfeited firearms sales generated $16,787 for Spokane, according to the ordinance. Those sales ranged from $633 to about $7,488 in any given year. “We may actually be costing the city coffers by reselling and recycling the guns,"" Mumm explained to AP. The text of the ordinance reads as follows: “The City of Spokane intends to do all it can to prevent and reduce violent crime in Spokane and has determined that destroying all seized or forfeited firearms rather than reselling them to the public or to gun dealers is a simple, sensible and effective way to reduce access to firearms and help reduce and prevent gun violence.”",Firearm Gun control Gun National Instant Criminal Background Check System Handgun Gun shop Background check Universal background check Rifle Concealed carry,"A gun used by the police in Spokane, Wash., in 2012.","The city of Spokane passed a city ordinance on Tuesday banning police from selling confiscated guns, according to The Associated Press.

How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Cody Wilson fired the shot heard around the internet in 2013 with what is widely believed to be the first 3D-printed gun. Now the self-described ""crypto-anarchist"" is at the center of a fierce legal battle over whether Americans should be able to print guns that would be unregulated and untraceable. After Wilson in 2013 successfully fired a bullet from the world’s first 3D-printed handgun and posted its design online, the video got nearly half a million views, and the design was downloaded nearly 100,000 times. After a few days, the link was terminated by law enforcement officials. Years of litigation followed, leading to a settlement a week ago allowing Wilson to re-release the gun’s downloadable blueprints, giving anyone with access to a 3D printer the ability to create their own so-called “ghost guns” – unregulated unregistered and untraceable firearms. Eight states and the District of Columbia sued Monday to block release of the blueprints, and a federal judge in Seattle on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order against Wilson and his nonprofit firm, Defense Distributed.

Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images But download counters on Wilson’s website suggest the blueprints were already downloaded over 20,000 times after Friday’s ruling. “The apocalypse has happened,” Wilson told ABC News on Tuesday. “You just missed it.” Opponents of his effort stressed the dangers. Guns from 3D printers would be “available to any felon, domestic abuser or terrorist,"" said Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a leader of the joint lawsuit by states against Wilson. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also emphasized the risks from easily available, homemade guns and said Congress should act. “No background check, no training, and they don’t even need to leave the house to make hundreds of guns,” Schumer said Monday, prior to the temporary restraining order on Wilson's company. “If the administration won’t act, Congress must do everything in its power to stop these websites before the damage by a mass shooter or a terrorist occurs.” A 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" is seen in a factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Wilson began experimenting with 3D-printed guns while he was at University of Texas law school, after graduating in 2010 from University of Central Arkansas with a degree in English. He printed his first gun during exam week of his second year of law school, then dropped out to further pursue the project. Wired named Wilson one of that ""15 most dangerous people in the world” in 2012 and one of that ""15 most dangerous people on the internet” in 2015. “The possibilities being introduced are huge,” Wired wrote in 2012. In 2012, when Wilson was just 24, he created Defense Distributed, a nonprofit defense technologies organization, and introduced his initiative to design and release files for 3D-printable guns. Wilson’s ambitions are about more than building guns. “Defense Distributed’s goal isn’t really personal armament,” Wilson explained in the 2013 video. “It’s more the liberation of information, It’s about living in the world where you can just download the file for the thing you want to make in this life.” Wilson said in a 2015 interview with an online radio broadcast that his idea for the project came from WikiLeaks. He was impressed by Julian Assange's controversial practice of publishing classified information and asked himself: “What is the WikiLeaks for guns?” ""What I recognized in Assange at the time was what’s called crypto-anarchy now and what the 'cypherpunks' developed,” Wilson told ABC News. “With these internet channels and cryptologic functions, we could end up creating secure channels, secret information, and provide worldwide distribution.” The plan was immediately controversial. Crowdfunding site Indiegogo kicked him off its platform. Statasys Inc. revoked his lease for one of their 3D-printing machines. Days after Wilson first posted the 3D-printed gun blueprints online, the State Department demanded Wilson remove them. Wilson filed suit, claiming a violation of his freedom of speech. He has said that opposition to his 3D guns shows shows how the government excessively exerts its power, limiting societal change and technological development. “It is obvious that the American techno-state has after religion become more fundamentalist and has after generations of global decolonization become more imperial,” Wilson wrote in the online publication Jacobite. “After the Cold War, it is far more aggressive in its global technical control and surveillance.” While his 3D-printed guns project was stalled in courts, he turned to other areas of interest. Wilson co-founded Dark Wallet, a “bitcoin wallet designed to make bitcoin use completely private,” allowing for increased confidentiality in financial transactions. Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed company, holds a 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" in his factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images “Bitcoin is a serious challenge to the sovereignty of the state and the state’s money power at a certain point,” Wilson said. That same year, Defense Distributed announced the Ghost Gunner, a milling machine that allows anyone to construct AR-15 and AR-308 metal guns. With accumulating legal fees, Wilson remains focused on the Ghost Gunner manufacturing company, now a lucrative business with 18 employees. In 2017, Wilson created Hatreon, an online crowdfunding site supporting popular alt-right voices – including white supremacists Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin -- who had been banned from the popular crowdfunding platform Patreon. Some of the money that helped fund the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was raised through Hatreon. “I felt no shame at all in helping Anglin and Spencer and these total villains,” Wilson said. “There’s just this intentional mainstream effort to gate-keep what are the boards of realistic debate, and of course that’s just not how [politics] functions.” The temporary restraining order slapped down this week will remain in effect at least until a hearing is held on Aug. 10, but in some ways, Wilson said, he has already accomplished what he set out to do. “I’ve demonstrated -- and Assange has and the bitcoin people have -- that crypto-anarchy is really what’s winning right now,” Wilson said. “The classical ideas of, control, confinement, surveillance—they don’t really apply to persistent, live networking.” Wilson’s endeavors have landed him on the radar of several gun reform organizations. “We have been following his activities for several years,” said J. Adam Skaggs, chief counsel to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Giffords Center is part of a coalition that fought unsuccessfully to prevent the court settlement on July 27. Giffords has identified other ghost gun sellers it’s concerned about, according to Skaggs. But he said Wilson stands out from the rest. Wilson said he won’t be censored and he’ll continue to engage with people whom some might consider extreme. “You’ll find good ideas in with the crazy people,” Wilson said.",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the self-described “Warreno-anarchist” who wants to release a gun from 3D-print guns online.","Meet Cody Wilson, the 'crypto-anarchist' who wants you to be able to 3D-print unregulated guns The debate over 3D-printed guns has been a legal one for years.

In the 2016 presidential election, President Trump won this district by 10 points. Torres Small is running against Republican state Rep.

After receiving the endorsement, Herrell released an ad in May noting her endorsement from the NRA and Gun Owners of America.

The store owners say, through their attorney, that Cruz only purchased the semi-automatic rifle off the shelf and did not purchase any accessories, modifications or ammunition so as not to raise eyebrows. Both owners are, according to their attorney, distraught. ""The tremendous sense of responsibility in this situation and just horribleness that they feel that one of their weapons fell into the hands of this maniac,"" the attorney said in the Miami Herald report. ""They are scared - not just for their safety - but more importantly about how the reaction is going to be for the rest of the community as they try to reenter it."" The Daily Mail also reported that Cruz apparently purchased other assault weapons from another local gun store - Gun World of South Florida - since 2016, but not the one used in the killing spree. ""He was not a regular customer of ours,"" Kim Waltuch the owner of Gun World told the Daily Mail. ""We went through the process of the background checks which is the only way we release a firearm. He was immediately approved."" Waltuch said the store has been raising money for victims of the shooting.

118,118,10282,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/us/politics/second-amendment-explained.html?partner=rss&emc=rss,Breaking Down the 27 Words of the Second Amendment,"“A well regulated Militia,” “A well regulated Militia,” “being necessary” “to the security of a free State” “comma —” “the right of the people” “to keep and” “bear arms” “shall not be infringed.” “shall not be infringed.” “What exactly does that mean?” So it’s only 27 words long, but it is probably the most cryptic part of the United States Constitution. It’s hard to know what the connection is between the two phrases in the Second Amendment. One of them seems to announce a collective right and the second an individual one — and knowing how they are connected is the key to understanding the Second Amendment. If you read that first clause by itself, a well-regulated militia is one that the government has taken pains to control. “American riflemen are the best riflemen in the world because the training they get is the best in the world.” You would think the Second Amendment protects a collective right to keep and bear arms, which is how it was understood for a long, long time in the history of the United States. The second clause cuts in a different direction. If you read this by itself, it would seem to say you have a personal right to keep and bear arms. However, when the Constitution speaks of the right of the people, it sometimes speaks in a more collective sense rather than individual. Let me discuss for a second “to keep and bear arms.” Most scholars agree that to keep arms is something you do as an individual, but to bear arms has more of a military flavor. What precisely the framers meant by arms is the subject of a lot of dispute. So the contemporary, modern interpretation of the Second Amendment as protecting an individual right to keep and bear arms is only 10 years old. In that case, the Supreme Court struck down what was probably the toughest gun control law in the nation, in Washington, D.C. “We hold that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to have and use arms for self-defense in the home.” But it tells us almost nothing aside from “in the home for self-defense.” And since then, the Supreme Court has ducked case after case after case that could refine and elaborate the scope of the Second Amendment to tell us, for instance, is there a right to bear arms in public? Are concealed carry laws O.K.? It’s told us almost nothing about Second Amendment rights.",Supreme Court of the United States Second Amendment to the United States Constitution  Firearm Right to keep and bear arms Gun Judge Lawyer Republican Party The New York Times,A gun control case in San Francisco.,"“A well regulated Militia,” “A well regulated Militia,” “being necessary” “to the security of a free State” “comma —” “the right of the people” “to keep and” “bear arms” “shall not be infringed.” “shall not be infringed.”","the second amendment protects a collective right to keep and bear arms, which is how it was understood for a long, long, the history of the u.s. the second clause cuts in a different direction. when the constitution speaks of the right of the people, it sometimes speaks in a more collective sense rather than individual. let me discuss for a second amendment. it tells us almost nothing aside from the home for self-defense in the u.s. and the supreme court has ducked case after case that could refine and elaborate arms in public",1,2,1,99,2,0,1,99.0,1,99

126,126,10699,https://us.cnn.com/2018/06/27/health/guns-dementia-partner/index.html,Dementia complicates US gun ownership,"With a bullet in her gut, her voice choked with pain, Dee Hill pleaded with the 911 dispatcher for help. ""My husband accidentally shot me,"" Hill, 75, of The Dalles, Ore., groaned on the May 16, 2015, call. ""In the stomach, and he can't talk, please ..."" Less than four feet away, Hill's husband, Darrell Hill, a former local police chief and two-term county sheriff, sat in his wheelchair with a discharged Glock handgun on the table in front of him, unaware that he'd nearly killed his wife of almost 57 years. The 76-year-old lawman had been diagnosed two years earlier with a form of rapidly progressive dementia, a disease that quickly stripped him of reasoning and memory. ""He didn't understand,"" said Dee, who needed 30 pints of blood, three surgeries and seven weeks in the hospital to survive her injuries. As America copes with an epidemic of gun violence that kills 96 people each day , there has been vigorous debate about how to prevent people with mental illness from acquiring weapons. But a little-known problem is what to do about the vast cache of firearms in the homes of aging Americans with impaired or declining mental faculties. Darrell Hill, a former local police chief and sheriff in Wasco County, Oregon, was diagnosed in 2013 with a form of rapidly progressive dementia. Darrell Hill, who died in 2016, was among the estimated 9 percent of Americans 65 and older diagnosed with dementia, a group of terminal diseases marked by mental decline and personality changes. Many, like the Hills, are gun owners and supporters of Second Amendment rights. Forty-five percent of people 65 and older have guns in their household, according to a 2017 Pew Research Center survey But no one tracks the potentially deadly intersection of those groups. A four-month Kaiser Health News investigation has uncovered dozens of cases across the U.S. in which people with dementia used guns to kill or injure themselves or others. From news reports, court records, hospital data and public death records, KHN found 15 homicides and more than 60 suicides since 2012, although there are likely many more. The shooters often acted during bouts of confusion, paranoia, delusion or aggression -- common symptoms of dementia. They killed people closest to them -- their caretaker, wife, son or daughter. They shot at people they happened to encounter -- a mailman , a police officer, a t rain conductor . At least four men with dementia who brandished guns were fatally shot by police. In cases where charges were brought, many assailants were deemed incompetent to stand trial. Many killed themselves. Among men in the U.S., the suicide rate is highest among those 65 and older; firearms are the most common method, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention These statistics do not begin to tally incidents in which a person with dementia waves a gun at an unsuspecting neighbor or a terrified home health aide. Volunteers with Alzheimer's San Diego, a nonprofit group, became alarmed when they visited people with dementia to give caregivers a break -- and found 25 to 30 percent of those homes had guns, said Jessica Empeño, the group's vice president. ""We made a decision as an organization not to send volunteers into the homes with weapons,"" she said. At the same time, an analysis of government survey data in Washington state found that about 5 percent of respondents 65 and older reported both some cognitive decline and having firearms in their home. The assessment, conducted for KHN by a state epidemiologist , suggests that about 54,000 of the state's more than 1 million residents 65 and older say they have worsening memory and confusion -- and access to weapons. About 1.4 percent of those respondents 65 and older -- representing about 15,000 people -- reported both cognitive decline and that they stored their guns unlocked and loaded, according to data from the state's 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. Washington is the only state to track those dual trends, according to the CDC. In a politically polarized nation, where gun control is a divisive topic, even raising concerns about the safety of cognitively impaired gun owners and their families is controversial. Relatives can take away car keys far easier than removing a firearm, the latter protected by the Second Amendment. Only five states have laws allowing families to petition a court to temporarily seize weapons from people who exhibit dangerous behavior. But in a country where 10,000 people a day turn 65 , the potential for harm is growing, said Dr. Emmy Betz, associate research director at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, a leading researcher on gun access and violence. Even as rates of dementia fall, the sheer number of older people is soaring , and the number of dementia cases is expected to soar as well. By 2050, the number of people with dementia who live in U.S. homes with guns could reach between roughly 8 million and 12 million, according to a May study by Betz and her colleagues. ""You can't just pretend it's not going to come up,"" Betz said. ""It's going to be an issue."" Polling conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation for this story suggests that few Americans are concerned about the potential dangers of elders and firearms. Nearly half of people queried in a nationally representative poll in June said they had relatives over 65 who have guns. Of those, more than 80 percent said they were ""not at all worried"" about a gun-related accident. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) Dee Hill had ignored her husband's demands and sold Darrell's car when it became too dangerous for him to drive. But guns were another matter. ""He was just almost obsessive about seeing his guns,"" Dee said. He worried that the weapons were dirty, that they weren't being maintained. Though she'd locked them in a vault in the carport, she relented after Darrell had asked, repeatedly, to check on the guns he'd carried every day of his nearly 50-year law enforcement career. She intended to briefly show him two of his six firearms, the Glock handgun and a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum revolver. But after he saw the weapons, Darrell accidentally knocked the empty pouch that had held the revolver to the floor. When Dee bent to pick it up, he somehow grabbed the Glock and fired. ""My concern [had been] that someone was going to get hurt,"" she said. ""I didn't in my wildest dreams think it was going to be me."" An investigation classified the incident as an assault and referred it to Wasco County District Attorney Eric Nisley, who concluded it was ""a conscious act"" to pick up the gun, but that Darrell didn't intend to harm his wife. ""I evaluated it as if a 5- or 6-year-old would pick up the gun and shoot someone,"" Nisley said. Dee was outraged at the suggestion she consider pressing charges. ""I didn't want anyone to think it was intentional. Nobody would have believed it anyway,"" she said. Dee Hill needed 30 pints of blood, three surgeries and seven weeks in the hospital. Proponents of gun ownership say guns are not to blame. The National Rifle Association declined to comment for this story. Dr. Arthur Przebinda, who represents the group Doctors for Responsible Gun Ownership, said researchers raising the issue want to curtail gun rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, and are ""seeking ways to disarm as many people as possible."" Focusing on the potential of people with dementia shooting others is a ""bloody shirt-waving tactic that's used to stir emotions to advance support for a particular policy endpoint,"" he said. ""I'm not disputing the case that it happens. I know it can happen,"" Przebinda said. ""My question is how prevalent it is, because the data is what should be driving our policy discussion, not fear or fear-mongering. It's bad science."" Two decades of NRA-backed political pressure that quashed public health research into the effects of gun violence partly explain the lack of data, experts said. But that doesn't mean there's no problem, said Dr. Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California-Davis. ""[Critics] are arguing as if what we have is evidence of absence,"" he said. ""We have something quite different, which is absence of evidence."" Delmar and Vergie ""Verg"" Scroughams of Rexburg, Idaho, ""can't imagine living without guns."" Even some families grappling with the problem are wary about calls to limit gun access. ""I hope your intent is not to 'bash' us for our beliefs and actions with guns,"" said Vergie ""Verg"" Scroughams, 63, of Rexburg, Idaho, who showed KHN reporters how she hid a loaded gun from her husband, who developed dementia after a stroke in 2009. Verg became worried after Delmar Scroughams, 83, grew angry and erratic earlier this year, waking up in the night and threatening to hit her. It was out of character for the former contractor who previously built million-dollar Idaho vacation homes for families of politicians and celebrities. ""In 45 years of marriage, we've never had a big fight,"" she said. ""We respect each other and we don't argue. That's not my Delmar."" ""I married my best friend,"" Verg Scroughams said of her husband, Delmar. ""We have been inseparable for close to 45 years."" Six months ago, Verg took the loaded .38-caliber Ruger from a drawer near Delmar's living room recliner, removed the bullets, and tucked it under socks in a box on a high shelf in her closet. ""He'll never look there,"" she said. She doesn't want Delmar to have access to that gun ― or to his collection of six shotguns locked in the bedroom cabinet. But Verg, a real estate agent who shows homes in remote locations, doesn't want to give up the weapons she counts on for comfort and protection. She carries her own handgun in the console of her car. ""We live in Idaho. Guns have been a big part of our lives,"" said Verg, who got her first rifle at age 12 and recalls hunting trips with her two sons among her fondest memories. ""I can't imagine living without guns."" Guns Under The Pillows Federal law prohibits people who are not mentally competent to make their own decisions, including those with advanced dementia, from buying or owning firearms. But a mere diagnosis of dementia does not disqualify someone from owning a gun, said Lindsay Nichols, federal policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. If a gun owner were reluctant to give up his arsenal, his family would typically have to take him to court to evaluate competency. Since the school shooting in Parkland, Fla., in February, more states are taking action to make it easier for families ― including those with a loved one with dementia ― to remove guns from the home. Eleven states have passed ""red flag"" gun laws that allow law enforcement or other state officials, and sometimes family members, to seek a court order to temporarily seize guns from people who pose a threat to themselves or others. Red flag bills have proliferated across the country since the Parkland shooting; six were passed this year and six more are pending. In Connecticut, which in 1999 enacted the nation's first red flag law, police used the measure to seize guns from five people reported to have dementia in 2017, according to a KHN records review. Last summer, an 84-year-old man with dementia alarmed his neighbors at a senior living community in Simsbury, Conn., by announcing that he had a gun and planned to shoot a bear. The man later reported that his .38-caliber Colt revolver was missing; police found it, loaded, in the console of his car. Police got a court order to seize that gun and a rifle he had in his closet. What Families Can Do When a loved one gets dementia, many families get no guidance on what to do about that person's guns. Here are legal and practical steps to stay safe. In December, police seized 26 guns from the Manchester, Conn., home of a 77-year-old man with dementia who was threatening to kill his wife. She told police that he was a danger to himself, and that his threats were ""normal baseline behavior."" In 2008, police in Manchester also seized nine firearms from a 70-year-old man with dementia who had pointed a gun at his daughter when she went to check on him because he didn't recognize her at first. The man had been sleeping with loaded guns under his pillows and hiding guns in drawers, and his daughter was worried for the safety of his home health aides. In Ohio, at one memory care clinic, 17 percent of patients diagnosed with dementia reported having a firearm in their homes, according to a 2015 Cleveland Clinic study But many families are reluctant to take away the sense of safety, independence and identity that their loved one, often the family patriarch, derives from guns. 'A Guilt I'll Never Ever Get Away From' In the Appalachian mountains of West Virginia, Malissa Helmandollar, a 46-year-old assistant in an optometrist's office, regrets not taking her father's guns away. Her dad, Larry Dillon, loved to hunt. Even after a coal-mining accident left him paralyzed from the waist down at age 21, Dillon would shoot turkey, squirrel and deer from the seat of his four-wheeler. For as long as she could remember, her father kept a gun under the cushion of his wheelchair. ""He felt he couldn't take care of us, or himself, without it,"" she said. In June 2017, when her father was 65, she began to notice strange behavior. ""He would see people crawling out of the washing machine,"" she said. He forgot how to tell time. Sometimes he would just stare at his dinner plate ""like he didn't know what to do."" Every night for weeks, Dillon grew scared that people were trying to break in and burn his house down, Helmandollar said. Dillon slept with a 9 mm semiautomatic Glock pistol at his nightstand in the double-wide trailer he shared with his wife, Sandy, in Princeton, W.Va. Helmandollar made him an appointment with a neurologist, but he never made it to the doctor. Five days before his appointment, on July 6, 2017, Helmandollar's 9-year-old daughter was sleeping over at her Mamaw and Papaw's house, as she loved to do. That evening, Helmandollar got a frantic call from her daughter. Helmandollar sped to the house with her son. She found her stepmother, Sandy, dead in an armchair with several bullet wounds. Helmandollar heard her father tell police that he saw intruders breaking in to the house, so he grabbed his Glock and started shooting in the bedroom where his wife and granddaughter were watching TV. But there had been no intruders that night. Dillon, who was deemed incompetent to stand trial for murder, was diagnosed with Lewy body dementia, a disease whose early symptoms can include vivid visual hallucinations. Helmandollar said her father never understood what he had done. Before he died in April, he kept asking Helmandollar why his wife never visited him. She could never bring herself to tell him. Meanwhile, Helmandollar's daughter and 18-year-old son are in counseling for the trauma they experienced. ""It crossed my mind that maybe I should've taken the guns, and I didn't,"" Helmandollar said. ""It'll be a guilt that I'll never ever get away from."" Belated diagnoses of dementia are too common, according to Dr. Melissa Henston, a geriatric psychologist in Denver who administers cognitive exams that can confirm impairment. She said many of the patients she sees have moderate or even severe dementia before being diagnosed. ""There's denial and a false belief that a lot of cognitive problems are just normal for age,"" she said. ""These conversations that need to take place never take place until it's too late."" For Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, there are limited treatments and no cure. About one-third of people with the disease become combative during the course of their illness, according to the Alzheimer's Association. And more than 20 percent who develop dementia become violent toward their caretakers, a 2014 study showed Advocates have long warned patients and families about the potential risk of guns, said Beth Kallmyer, the Alzheimer's Association vice president of care and support. ""The reality is, there's no way to know who's at risk for becoming agitated or even violent,"" she said. 'We Need To Pay More Attention' In Minnesota, Sharon Van Leer, the 70-year-old director of diversity and inclusion at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, said she never would have predicted the phone call she got from police nearly three years ago. Her father, Kenneth Bowser, a 90-year-old Army veteran and retired postal worker, had been living for many years with his oldest son, Larry, 65, in the St. Paul suburb of Maplewood. At 5:30 p.m. on Sept. 12, 2015, Kenneth Bowser dialed 911. ""Who is bothering you?"" the dispatcher asked him, according to a transcript of the call. ""My oldest son, oldest son and I shot him, I shot him,"" Bowser replied. ""He's laying there dead, dead."" ""Where is the gun?"" the dispatcher asked. ""The gun is in my hand,"" Bowser said. Van Leer said she believes her father never intended to be violent: ""Daddy was never like that."" In the 911 call, Bowser appears confused. ""I'm 70 -- uh, 100 -- 91 years old,"" he said. ""I'm paralyzed on one side."" Bowser, who had not been diagnosed with dementia before the shooting, was confirmed to have Alzheimer's and deemed not competent to stand trial. Now Van Leer drives 90 minutes most Sundays to visit her 93-year-old father in a locked, state-run nursing home where he's set to spend the rest of his life. Staff wheel him out to a windowless visitation room, where Van Leer and her sister spoon-feed him nutrition shakes and give him back rubs. Van Leer said she had noticed some signs of decline before the shooting — he would leave bacon on the stove and burn it, or forget where he put his cigars. But because she did not live with him, she said, she didn't realize how far his dementia had progressed. ""We need to pay more attention, as our parents get older, to the changes,"" Van Leer said. ""They can disguise it really well."" Removing guns from the home is the best way to prevent violence, the Alzheimer's Association and other experts advise. But Dr. Diana Kerwin, director of the Texas Alzheimer's and Memory Disorders program at Texas Health, said that's not the answer for all families. ""I don't do a blanket 'guns are bad, you can't have guns in the home,' "" she said. Instead, she advocates storing guns safely -- locked up, unloaded, with the ammunition kept separate from the guns. Firearms can also be disabled or, in some cases, replaced with a decoy, although that raises the risk of them being mistaken for a real weapon in an emergency. ""We had one patient with a gun with rubber bands that he would shoot and he was fine with that,"" Kerwin said. ""He was used to shooting varmints. You try to help them maintain the lifestyle they always had."" Hair-Trigger Tempers Families walk a fine line, balancing independence with safety. Christal Collins, a 50-year-old massage therapist in South Carolina, never got along with her dad. He beat her and her mother before the couple divorced, she said. But when he nearly died from spinal meningitis in 2013, Christal agreed to take him in — along with his small arsenal. Bill Collins, a retired heavy-equipment operator and Army veteran, was so attached to his guns that he kept a .22-caliber pistol in his pocket day and night, even while he slept. On Saturdays, he'd load it with rat shot and fire the tiny pellets at snakes as he mowed the lawn. On Sunday mornings, as he watched Shepherd's Chapel sermons on TV, he'd clean the gun and reload it with Magnum bullets. Bill also kept a cabinet stocked with three handguns, three sawed-off rifles, three hunting rifles and a thousand rounds of ammo. While he had stopped hunting, he told his family he didn't want to be caught without a gun when the ""race war"" broke out. A 1971 family photo shows Christal Collins, left, with her father, Bill, and sisters Tracy and Marie. As he grew older and sicker, Bill shuffled around the house in slippers and didn't seem as physically threatening, Christal said. But his bouts of aggression and paranoia grew worse, and in November 2014, after Bill had gotten lost for two hours at a local convenience store, his doctor said he was showing signs of dementia. Christal considered sending her father to an assisted living complex, but when he found out he couldn't bring his guns or knives, he refused to go. And she swore she would never put her parents through the neglect she saw when she worked at a nursing home. So she stayed in the house with him, in a rural, swampy stretch of Conway, S.C., not far from Myrtle Beach. Christal tried to limit her father's access to guns. One day, she slipped the key to his gun cabinet off his keychain — a difficult feat, since he slept with the keychain hooked to his belt. It was ""war"" in the house for three days, she said, as he hounded her and accused her of stealing the key. He then busted the original lock with a hammer and screwdriver and installed three new padlocks. Christal Collins says her father, who struggled with paranoia, shot her fiance, Allen Holtzman, in 2015. Bill also slept with a loaded .357 Magnum under his pillow. ""There was no gun safety,"" Christal said. ""Every time I tried to talk about it, it would be a fight or an argument or a problem."" On June 14, 2015, a Sunday, her father started ""cussing and ranting and raving,"" accusing someone of stealing things from his room, she said. Bill, who was 75, raised his hand to hit Christal -- something he hadn't done in his old age -- and her fiancé, Allen Holtzman, stepped in to intervene. In a flash, Bill pulled the .22 pistol out of his pocket and fired at Holtzman's chest, knocking him down to the couch. ""Dad, you shot him!"" Christal yelled in disbelief. Then she saw him put the gun at the base of Holtzman's skull. She knocked it away just as he fired. ""Wrong damn shells!"" Bill declared in disappointment, discovering he had fired rat shot. Bill aimed the gun at Holtzman's 20-year-old daughter, and then at Christal. He had a look in his eyes ""like the lights were on but nobody was home,"" Christal recalled. She dragged Holtzman, who was bleeding from over 200 rat pellets, toward safety in their bedroom, as more pellets flew behind them. Christal Collins says that if she had to do it again, she would have removed her father's guns from the home. As Christal talked to a 911 dispatcher on the phone, she heard two bangs. The first was her father slamming the door to his room. The second was her father taking the gun and, after replacing the cartridges, shooting himself in the head. Some argue that people should have the right to end their lives on their own terms instead of suffer through the debilitating decline of dementia. But Christal said she hates that her father harmed others along the way. And the aftermath of a suicide can be horrific, she said. ""When you clean your dad's brain matter off the wall, the pillow, the carpet ..."" she said, trailing off in tears, the trauma still raw nearly three years later, as she sat with her fiancé in their double-wide trailer home. Holtzman, a 42-year-old construction worker, shrugged off his own injuries, saying the pellets just burned. But Christal said they were lucky her father forgot to change the ammo. ""Allen, you would've been dead,"" Christal said. Christal said if she had to do it again, she would have removed the guns from the home. Though, she reflected, ""I honestly don't know if we could have taken them away."" Giving Up The Guns For families grappling with such decisions, one option is to establish a ""gun trust"" that outlines how the weapons will pass to family members once a person becomes incapacitated or dies. These trusts may make it easier for people who must give up firearms in order to move into a nursing home, for instance, said David Goldman, an estate-planning lawyer in Jacksonville, Fla., who said he has drawn up over 20,000 gun trusts. But the process works best when the gun owner complies. ""They rarely want to give up their guns,"" Goldman said. Another obstacle is that gun trusts must be drawn up before dementia becomes too advanced. Ideally, families should discuss firearm access soon after a diagnosis of dementia and consider setting a ""firearm retirement date,"" akin to an advance directive for guns, Betz and colleagues advise. It's similar to discussions about taking away the car keys when driving becomes dangerous, she said. ""One of the tricky things is, for driving, there are some assessments you can do,"" Betz said. ""They're not perfect, but they're helpful. There isn't anything for firearms."" Doctors who routinely ask dementia patients about driving should also ask about guns, Wintemute said. Too often, though, they don't. ""Docs say: 'I don't know enough about the risks and benefits, I don't have the time,'"" Wintemute said. ""Only about one-third do it with any frequency."" Critics of gun restrictions like Przebinda argue that the essential difference between driving and guns is that one is a privilege and the other is a protected constitutional right. ""The two are not the same,"" he said. ""You do not have a right to conveyance. You have a right to self-defense, you have a right to protecting your home and your family that's intrinsic to you as a human being."" He balks at any formal assessment of firearm use among people with dementia, saying it could lead to ""a totalitarian system that decides when you can have rights and when you cannot."" Instead, the decision should be left to families, Przebinda said. ""People who own guns know what measures are available to them."" Even that knowledge, however, may not be enough. Dee Hill of Oregon said it was ""strictly an accident"" that her husband, the retired sheriff, shot and critically wounded her. To this day, she doesn't regret showing him the guns.

""He spent darn near 40, almost 50 years in law enforcement and a gun was always with him, and so to deprive him of not even seeing them, in my heart of hearts, I couldn't deny him."" For Verg and Delmar Scroughams of Idaho, the dilemma of keeping guns in the house remains. In a lucid moment in May, Delmar acknowledged that the weapons he's had all his life could be dangerous. ""I got a disease I don't know the name of and, eventually, anything could happen,"" he said. Such moments of awareness are becoming rare, Verg admitted. Soon, Delmar may no longer recognize her. As his condition worsens, she said, it's up to her to make sure no one is harmed. ""I would feel extremely responsible,"" she said.

695,695,10593,http://abcnews.go.com/Business/investors-pressure-gun-industry-limits/story?id=53560512,Investors pressure gun industry but there are limits,"Investors pressure gun industry but there are limits States are moving toward divesting their pension funds of gun stocks. Public outrage over the shooting deaths of 17 Florida high school students and faculty last month is bringing pressure on the gun industry from institutional investors. But whether that pressure will result in real change -- on society or the financial industry -- is unclear. States like New Jersey are moving toward divesting their pension funds of gun stocks, a move that CalPERS (the California Public Retirement System) made in 2013 following the school shootings in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Meanwhile, investment companies BlackRock and Vanguard have been putting heat on gun manufacturers. Black Rock is now giving investors the option of opting out of gun stocks in some funds, and Vanguard, which has long offered gun-free funds, has been in discussions with manufacturers. But neither company has declared an outright ban on investing its clients’ money in firearms and there’s a good reason for this. These two companies are the largest purveyors of passively managed index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors have been putting heat on gun manufacturers, but whether that pressure will result in real changes is unclear. Alex Quesada/Polaris Regardless of an investment company’s sensitivity to social opposition of guns, there’s a functionality problem with divesting all funds of gun-related investments. To be an S&P 500 index fund, such a fund must hold stocks from that entire index. And while gun manufacturers tend to be small companies, some of the retail companies that sell firearms are huge -- notably, Dick's Sporting Goods and Walmart. Since the Feb. 14 school massacre in Parkland, Florida, both retailers have stopped selling assault rifles and raised the age for gun purchases to 21. Even if investment companies feel pressure to eliminate any trace of guns from their offerings, it would be impossible to keep the stocks of major retailers selling them out of all index funds and ETFs. Because they’re relatively small public companies, gun manufacturers could be viewed as easier financial targets than some past targets of SRI (socially responsible investing) movements—most notably, the tobacco industry. CalPERS got wound up about tobacco more than a decade ago, but didn’t end up fully divesting. People comfort each other at a public memorial for the victims of the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Fla., Feb. 16, 2018. Gerald Herbert/AP Pension funds have a different problem. They’re required to get the best returns for investors. Generally, the view in that industry is: If that means guns, then so be it. CalPERS, the largest public or private pension fund with more than $300 billion in assets under management, has the flexibility to snub guns because its size confers enough investment clout to open up many options. But most pension funds, especially private ones without the public policy accountability, don’t have this kind of flexibility. It came out soon after the Parkland shooting that teacher pension funds in 12 states own stocks in gun manufacturers. These states include Florida and California (where teachers have a separate fund from other public employees). Doubtless, there will be at least some divestiture by these funds, but generally, anti-gun pressure on the financial services industry will have to be sustained to make a lasting difference on society and on the financial services industry. This would be a departure from past patterns of waning public and investor attention as the focus on mass shootings fades until the next one unfortunately occurs.

367,367,10900,https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/09/trump-gop-blame-mental-illness-shootings-why-gut-medicaid-column/479154002/,Mental health crisis isn't about guns. It's about Trump & GOP gutting Medicaid: Kennedy,"Joe Kennedy III “A mental health problem at the highest level,” President Trump said after a shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas left 26 parishioners dead. “Mental health is often a big problem underlying these tragedies,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said after a gunman killed 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. If Republican leaders are talking about mental health, it’s generally for one reason — to avoid talking about guns. By any measure, the claim that mental illness is to blame for gun violence is false. The United States does not have a disproportionate number of people suffering from mental illness, but we do have a disproportionate number of guns, mass shooters and deaths by firearm. Only 3% to 5% of violent crimes are committed by mentally ill people, and they themselves are roughly 10 times more likely to be the victims of violencethan the general population. Still, Trump and Ryan are right that we have a mental health crisis in this country. What they don’t mention is that it's driven by the Republican Party’s systemic erosion of health care and coverage. Specifically, their efforts to decimate the single largest source of funding for mental health and substance use disorder treatment in the United States — Medicaid. More:What if Dems were in charge? I'd let people buy Medicaid coverage: Senator More:On Medicaid work requirements, who will judge the character judges? Medicaid covers 75 million Americans, 50 million of them children, elderly or disabled. For those with mental illness or a substance use disorder, Medicaid is often a lifeline to treatment they otherwise would go without. Today, in the midst of a devastating opioid epidemic, it covers nearly 40% of non-elderly adults with an opioid addiction and 26% with a serious mental illness. Put another way, you can’t champion mental health reform or opioid treatment with one hand and aim to gut Medicaid with the other. Nonetheless, Trump and the GOP have spent the last 15 months working to do just that. First, it was their ill-fated effort to ""repeal and replace"" the Affordable Care Act, which would have cut Medicaid by more than $800 billion, ended the ACA’s Medicaid expansion and imposed arbitrary caps on benefits for people left in the program. The American public rejected their plan. But the administration, undeterred, proposes to cut the program by $800 billion in its latest budget. And Trump and his team have brought their vendetta against Medicaid to the states, giving local officials and administrators unprecedented authority to limit coverage and benefits. Last month, states like Kentucky, Indiana and Arkansas got a green light to cut Medicaid access for people who lose their jobs and restrict the ability of families to keep the health care they need to get back on their feet. States like Ohio tell us this is a deeply flawed approach; having Medicaid coverage makes people more likely to work. For most Americans, this is common sense. It is exceedingly difficult to find or keep a job when you cannot meet basic health care needs for yourself or your family. Which explains why today nearly 80% of adults on Medicaid live in a family where someone is employed, 60% work themselves and the vast majority of those not working are in school, caring for a loved one, or facing serious physical or mental illness that makes work difficult if not impossible. When you hear the Republican talking point that these reforms are intended only for folks who make too much money to “deserve” assistance, look at Alabama. Its proposed work requirement would apply to parents and caretakers living below 18% of the poverty line; or less than $4,524 for a family of four for an entire year. More:New Trump rules will drive people with disabilities off Medicaid and out of work More:As state voters lead on Medicaid, could health care be the next gay marriage? POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Many of these families will lose coverage not because they refuse to work but because they are unable to comply with the onerous bureaucratic demands that come with work requirements. Furthermore, the Trump administration is not allowing states to use Medicaid funds for things like job training, child care and transportation that would help people find work again. These challenges will hit the mental health community in particular. Mental illness is chronic and stigma often compounds the difficulty of navigating a job — stigma that is carelessly reinforced every time a Republican elected official blames the mentally ill for causing this country’s gun violence epidemic. Tragically, work requirements are just one of the ways this administration is targeting our mental health infrastructure. States like Arizona and Wisconsin have asked for federal lifetime limits on Medicaid beneficiaries that the government deems “able-bodied,” a move that puts government officials in the business of making medical decisions and deciding the merit of our health challenges. States like Kansas have proposed ending Medicaid coverage after as little as 36 months. As anyone with depression or a substance use disorder (not to mention cancer or heart disease or diabetes) would tell you, healing seldom complies with a three-year deadline. “We’ve been dreaming about this since … you and I were drinking at a keg,” Ryan mused to a fellow conservative last year about capping Medicaid spending. For the sick and suffering among us, Medicaid is survival. The next time we see GOP leaders excuse their inaction on gun violence by scapegoating those with mental illness, let’s take a cue from the brave student survivors in Parkland and call BS. Rep.

Beierle, who killed himself on Friday after killing Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley and wounding five others at Hot Yoga Tallahassee, had filmed several virulently misogynist videos in 2014, according to David Mack, Amber Jamieson, and Julia Reinstein of BuzzFeed News. He had also uploaded sexist and violent songs to Soundcloud in the last few months. In the videos, Beierle rants about women who canceled dates or gave him their phone numbers even though they had boyfriends. He also mentions Elliot Rodger, the gunman who killed six people and wounded 13 in Isla Vista, California in 2014 — and who has become a hero to men who identify as “incels” (short for “involuntary celibate”). The Tallahassee shooting was the third crime in a single week that was apparently preceded by a trail of online hate. Robert Bowers, the man suspected of killing 11 people and wounding six others in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday, appears to have posted threatening language about Jewish people and HIAS National Refugee Shabbat, a refugee aid group formerly known as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, on Gab, a social network that has become a home for anti-Semitism and racism. Cesar Sayoc, the man arrested last Friday in connection with bombs mailed to CNN and several critics of President Donald Trump, appears to have threatened Democrats on Twitter and Facebook. “Hug your loved son,Niece,wife family real close everytime U walk out your home,” said one tweet sent to former Vice President Joe Biden, apparently by Sayoc. It included an image of Biden’s home with a target superimposed on it. The postings apparently made by Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were part of a pattern going back years. Elliot Rodger left behind a YouTube video in which he said women would be punished for not being attracted to him. And George Sodini, a gunman whose murder of three women at a gym outside Pittsburgh in 2009 appears to share similarities with the Tallahassee shooting, maintained a blog detailing his anger toward women for months before committing the crime. These men share more than their apparent online histories of bigotry. All were part of communities, online or off, that seemed to reinforce their views. That’s why online hatred and harassment is so serious. It’s not just that an individual person’s online posts can be warning signs of future violence. It’s also that hateful posts, even by those who never commit crimes, create an environment where those crimes are encouraged, accepted, and even celebrated. Many mass murderers and other criminals have left behind an online trail Beierle’s YouTube and SoundCloud history is rife with violent sexism. In one video, he says of a woman who canceled dates with him, “I could have ripped her head off,” according to BuzzFeed. In a song called “Locked in My Basement,” he describes holding a woman prisoner and raping her. He mentions Rodger in a video called “Plight of the Adolescent Male,” saying, “I’d like to send a message now to the adolescent males ... that are in the position, the situation, the disposition of Elliot Rodger, of not getting any, no love, no nothing. This endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration. That was me, certainly, as an adolescent.” Beierle had also been arrested in 2012 and 2016 for grabbing women’s buttocks without their consent, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. Meanwhile, posts apparently by Robert Bowers, the alleged Pittsburgh assailant, reveal a history of anti-Semitism, and a web of influences. On Gab, someone by the name of Robert Bowers posted a variety of anti-Semitic slurs and statements, including “jews are the children of satan,” according to the Associated Press. The same user criticized President Trump for being insufficiently anti-Jewish, and bragged about his gun collection, calling it his “glock family” and saying one gun in particular had an “amazing trigger.” As Vox’s Jane Coaston notes, Gab was started as a “free speech” alternative to Twitter, and allows forms of hate speech that are banned on more mainstream social networks. Because of this, it’s become a gathering place — and recruitment forum — for neo-Nazi groups. One post from a group called Atomwaffen Division features swastikas, racial slurs, and the invitation, “Join your local Nazis.” The synagogue shooting suspect also acted out of a specific kind of anti-Semitism, as Vox’s Dara Lind points out: “blaming Jews in America for bringing in an invasion of nonwhite immigrants who would slaughter the white race.” This particular kind of bigotry has been fueled by Trump’s claims that his political opponents are at fault for the caravan of migrants approaching the US, and by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists on Gab and other social networks, who have cast the caravan as a Jewish “invasion.” Most of the people posting this theory online have never committed anti-Semitic violence, but they helped create the conditions under which something like the Pittsburgh shooting could occur. Twitter and Facebook accounts connected to Sayoc contain threats against Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder, both of whom received pipe bombs. CNN analyst Phil Mudd also received a Twitter threat apparently from Sayoc. Political analyst Rochelle Ritchie reported a threat apparently from Sayoc to Twitter in the days before the shooting, but Twitter did not take action. Sayoc was apparently a devotee of a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which have spread on Twitter. As Vox’s German Lopez points out, he often posted criticisms of liberal billionaire George Soros, a common target of anti-Semitic fear-mongering on Twitter and elsewhere. Trump has fanned the flames of this fear-mongering, retweeting a claim earlier this year that Soros was a “nazi who turned in his fellow Jews.” Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were far from alone in leaving what appear to be online trails pointing to future violent behavior. “Tomorrow is the day of retribution,” Rodger said in his last YouTube video, according to the New York Times. “For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me.” “I do not know why you girls aren’t attracted to me,” he added. “But I will punish you all for it.” Rodger also identified as an “incel” and posted on forums populated by men with similar frustrations. The 22-year-old, who took his own life after killing others, became something of a hero to other “incels,” as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has noted. A man who killed 10 people by driving a van down a Toronto street in April identified himself on Facebook as part of the “Incel Rebellion.” Also on Facebook, he praised the Rodger, calling him the “Supreme Gentleman,” a nickname Rodger had chosen for himself. The man who shot and killed three women at a Pittsburgh gym, meanwhile, wrote on his personal website in 2008, “I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne – yet 30 million women rejected me – over an 18 or 25-year period.” “A man needs a woman for confidence,” he added. “He gets a boost on the job, career, with other men, and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a friend. This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded.” He also had ties to the pickup artist community, having purchased the book How to Date Young Women: For Men Over 35, and appearing in a video of one of author R. Don Steele’s lectures. Pickup artistry, more in vogue in the early 2000s than it is now, sometimes treated women as less human than men, as “targets” to be coerced or fooled into sex. It’s not murder, of course, but this was the climate of misogyny in which he planned his crime. Fighting hate crimes means understanding the communities that support them Each of these men may have seemed like a loner — but in fact, each was part of a group of people with similarly toxic views directed at Jewish people, women, or people of color. And we need to understand crimes like the Tallahassee and Pittsburgh shootings and the mailing of pipe bombs to Democrats within their larger context of on- and offline hate. That means holding platforms accountable for the behavior they allow. In the wake of the pipe bombings, Twitter has apologized for not taking Ritchie’s report more seriously. “We are investigating what happened and will continue to work to improve how we handle concerns raised by anyone on Twitter,” the account @TwitterSafety tweeted last week. But in response to a request for specifics from The Verge, the company merely pointed to blog posts from earlier in the year. “This is a familiar story from Twitter,” the Verge’s Andrew Liptak writes: “apologizing for reacting after the fact after it becomes clear that someone violated the site’s terms.” Gab, meanwhile, is being more defiant. “Gab.com is under attack,” read a message posted by the company on Monday. “We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh.” Investigating and prosecuting online threats can be tricky because perpetrators can conceal their identities and locations, and because when someone in one part of the country threatens someone in another, it’s not always clear which law enforcement agency should take the case. But there’s evidence that law enforcement, even at the federal level, isn’t doing all it can: The Department of Justice prosecutes only a small minority of cases of online threats and stalking, Joshua Eaton reported at ThinkProgress last year. A bill that would provide resources to help the FBI, DOJ, and local authorities fight such crimes, introduced by Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), has been stuck in committee since last July. While law enforcement can prosecute threats and stalking, other hate speech isn’t illegal. But that doesn’t mean companies like Twitter have to allow it on their platforms. As journalist Stacy-Marie Ishmael pointed out on Twitter, women, and especially black women, who experience disproportionate harassment online, have been warning of the seriousness of this harassment for years. Their warnings have mostly fallen on deaf ears. Taking online hate seriously would require platforms like Twitter to make fighting threats and bigotry a core part of their mission, not an afterthought. As Kate Klonick wrote at Vox in 2016, “Twitter needs to view fighting abuse as an essential feature.” It also means law enforcement, government, and ordinary users need to be aware of the ways in which online communities can fuel offline hate. Men like Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc have been posting about their violent intentions for years now, and getting support and affirmation for doing so.

Guttenberg accused Kavanaugh of ignoring him as he tried to shake his hand. Sources close to Kavanaugh pushed back saying the nominee had no idea who Guttenberg was and that security intervened to end the exchange. Eastmond also expressed concerns about Kavanaugh's opinions on assault weapons and said too many dangerous people have access to those guns and use them to terrorize Americans. What Kavanaugh has said: In 2011, Kavanaugh dissented from a majority opinion of the DC Circuit that upheld a ban that applied to semiautomatic rifles in the District of Columbia.

He said he is still haunted by the fact that he can’t remember if he told Jaime he loved her as she rushed off to school the day of the shooting, when she and 16 other people died. Guttenberg described how she was shot and killed on the school’s third floor, a bullet from an AR-15 assault-style weapon piercing her side and severing her spine, killing her instantly. On a makeshift stage in Belo Garden park, he reiterated his specific calls for gun reform: universal background checks, red-flag laws that will allow police to confiscate guns from people deemed dangerous, banning high-capacity magazines and raising the age to purchase weapons from 18 to 21. As he spoke, pro-gun supporters just outside the park heckled him with a bullhorn. The rally, one of two gun control protests, was organized by the newly formed NoRA — or “No Rifle Association."" They brought piles of free “NoRA” T-shirts and posters reading “OUR LIVES OVER NRA MONEY.” Some had signs reading “NEVER AGAIN” and “AR-15 IS A WMD.” Actor Alyssa Milano, founder of the group, read from an “NRA Bill of Rights,” a list of demands such as “the right of our children to live free of gun violence in our nation,” and led the crowd in chants of “Vote Them Out!”, referring to politicians who take contributions from the NRA. Milano and other activists had a brief confrontation with the gun-rights supporters, until Dallas police officers escorted them from the park. Also in attendance at the NoRA rally were Manuel and Patricia Oliver, whose son, Joaquin, was also killed during the Florida shooting. Manuel Oliver said the gun reform movement started after Parkland has gained more momentum than those that occurred after previous mass shootings for two reasons: improved technology social media and the impatience of the young activists. “They don’t have patience to wait for answers,” he said. “They want answers right now. That’s how they were raised.” Two hours after the gun reform rally, an “open carry” pro-gun-rights gathering drew around 30 people to Belo Garden Park. James Singer, 27, of Pleasanton, Texas, showed up with an AR-15 rifle slung on his torso and holding a white flag emblazoned with a picture of an AR-15 and the words, “COME AND TAKE IT.” He said they were there to show that safety increases when people have guns and to stress the importance of gun rights. “We’re here to defend the Second Amendment,” Singer said. “Without the Second Amendment, the government could do whatever it wants.” Ben Jackson, an NoRA co-founder, said the group is aimed at educating the public on the NRA’s influence in government and urges voters not to support politicians who accept NRA donations, whether they be Republican or Democrat. “The amount of money the NRA spends on government really affects how we debate gun violence,” he said. “We’re not trying to take away anyone’s guns, we’re not trying to repeal the Second Amendment. We’re trying to help government function better.” Dallas residents Carlo Taboada and Keila Curry said they showed up to the NoRA rally to support groups pushing gun reform. Taboada was dressed in a costume that made it look like he was being carried on the shoulders of President Trump. His T-shirt read “NRA, I’m with stupid” with an arrow pointing down. “We’re just doing our small part to ignite some change in regard to gun laws,” Taboada said. “It’s way overdue.” At another rally at City Hall, supporters of the student-led ""Rally4Reform"" gathered at City Hall to protest what they said was the ""NRA leadership's dangerous agenda."" In remarks to the 80,000 participants at the convention, Trump on Friday set a tone likely to either inspire or anger activists, depending on their leaning. Trump told NRA members they need to be vigilant in the face of anti-NRA forces. ""Your Second Amendment rights are under siege,"" the president told the cheering crowd at the convention center. ""But they will never, ever be under siege as long as I am you president."" He also dismissed calls to ban guns as a way to reduce terrorism or gun deaths, by noting the outbreak of incidents in which terrorists used trucks to ram pedestrians. ""So lets ban all trucks and vans. Maybe all cars."" he said. NRA spokesman Jason Brown said the group has been aware of the planned demonstrations and is taking security precautions. “NRA’s security team has worked closely with local law enforcement to ensure the safety and security of all our members, exhibitors, visitors and staff throughout the event and do not expect any issues to occur,” he said.",Parkland Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Gun control School shooting Gun Shooting National Rifle Association Right to keep and bear arms Massacre School,"Fred Guttenberg, the father of the 14-year-old killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Saturday.","DALLAS — The father of one of the teenage victims of the Parkland, Fla., massacre mounted a stage only four blocks from the National Rifle Association convention Saturday to call for gun reform as gun rights supporters heckled him with a bullhorn. “My daughter was hunted at school,” Fred Guttenberg said, recalling the death of 14-year-old Jaime at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school on Feb. 14.","dallas' father of one of the teenage victims of the parkland, fla., mass shooting on a stage only four blocks from the national rifle association convention saturday to call for gun reform as gun rights supporters heckled him with a bullhorn. jaime at marjory stoneman douglas high school on feb. 14, he said he is still haunted by the fact that he can’t remember if he told jaime he loved her as she rushed off to school the day of the shooting, when she and 16 other people died. the 14-year-old was shot and killed on the school’s third floor, a bullet from an ar-15 assault-style weapon piercing",1,1,1,99,16,0,0,99.0,0,99

Enough already.","It was written by Heidi L. Pottinger, director of clinical investigations in the Department of Health Promotion Sciences at the University of Arizona College of Public Health, who argues that these drills cause trauma for children. Pottinger is also the mother of two, and both her children have been part of active-shooter drills since one was 4 months old and the other was 3 years old. She is also the founder of the nonprofit Child Health & Resilience Mastery (CHARM), Inc., as well as a Public Voices Fellow with the OpEd Project, which is a social venture founded to increase the range of voices and quality of ideas that are heard in the public square. By Heidi L. Pottinger AD AD Eleven people were murdered at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in another mass shooting. Nothing can truly prepare us for this violence, whether in synagogues or schools. Again, we have failed to address preventable gun violence. Dec. 14 marks six years since the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, when 20 children and six educators were killed. Since that dreadful day, tragedies like this have become horribly routine, and schools continue to practice lockdown drills. We typically associate lockdown drills with school-age children, adolescents, and staff practicing safety protocols. Sadly, infants and preschoolers also participate. AD My daughter has been included in lockdown drills since she was 4 months old. She huddles behind the diaper-changing station with her caregivers and other babies, ranging in age from 6 weeks to 15 months. Down the hall, her brother is hiding with his classmates and teacher. They have been doing this since he was 3 years old and ever since, he’s been anxiously chewing his nails, afraid to go anywhere alone inside our home without an adult. Based on my expertise as a family and child health researcher, he is clearly traumatized. AD And he’s not alone. He is one of millions of young children across the nation regularly practicing lockdown drills, huddling behind furniture and inside closets. Meanwhile, their teachers feign complete confidence, strategically managing to keep their beloved young students utterly silent while the clock ticks. Last week, my husband took our son to a football game, and, after our alma mater scored their first touchdown, they high-fived each other and hugged in celebration. When the fireworks went off, instead of marveling at the spectacle, our son began crying in terror that there was an “active shooter.” AD Those were his words. He’s 4. Children, especially those younger than 6, should not be expected to continue simulating the problem of school shootings by frequently participating in stressful lockdown drills that have not been demonstrated effective, can traumatize them, and potentially impact their education and health outcomes. AD While our children and their teachers are usually aware when a lockdown is a drill or “just pretend,” their brains do not, sending their nervous systems into fight, flight, or freeze. Except, they can only do one thing: freeze. In the short-term, their bodies are overwhelmed with adrenaline and cortisol. This type of unpredictable stress activates inflammatory responses in the body that have been shown to cause depression. For children who also might be suffering from food insecurity and/or fewer opportunities for physical activity, their ability to fight illness is compromised. AD Long-term, children are at greater risk for developing chronic illness as adults and, if they experience a life-threatening trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder. Childhood stress is also linked to lower IQ scores and academic achievement. Couple these risk factors with few or no healthy opportunities to manage stress, and lockdown drills are a recipe for disaster for our children. AD While lockdown drills provide practical value, they are not always effective — and have actually been used to inform shooters’ tactical strategies. Our government needs to treat gun violence like the public health crisis that it is. Schools need the resources to substitute burdening children and communities with lockdown drills, with positive behavioral interventions and support for parents and staff, instead. And students need opportunities to release stress hormones immediately after drills. AD Let’s equip caregivers and educators with ways to nurture each child to realize their greatness, influencing all children in a positive way. Let’s train adults on how to identify, assess and respond to threatening behaviors rather than distressing entire communities by repeatedly simulating the problem. It would be an investment in our schools and the future of every child. AD Such strengths- and evidence-based, personalized approaches might actually prompt our children to learn and be carefree at school — the way it should be — instead of forcing entire generations to hide in silence.",Image Getty Images Brittany Pollack Photography Photograph Newseum News Johns Hopkins University,"Heidi L.

Wednesday was intended to be the first day that computer-assisted drawing files for polymer-based guns, including an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle, would be posted to DefCad, an online hub for 3D-printed gun schematics. Debate between gun hobbyists and gun violence prevention groups peaked Tuesday afternoon when several state attorneys filed a lawsuit against DefCad’s parent company, Defense Distributed, the Second Amendment Foundation, the State Department, and other federal agencies that regulate weapons. I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2018 How Does the White House Feel About 3D-Printed Guns? The National Rifle Association has endorsed the 3D-printed gun schematics being published, defending it as an issue of innovation, free speech, and, of course, the Second Amendment. Trump has bowed to the NRA’s agenda of arming teachers and making guns easier to own, use, and purchase in the past, despite earlier promises that he would raise the age limit to purchase rifles and backing legislation for near-universal background checks. Trump’s tweet today, despite its vague sentiment, would indicate that he is not in support of widely available 3D-printed plastic guns. And the White House later reaffirmed that gesture by confirming that the administration stands behind an existing law that makes it illegal to own or produce plastic homemade guns. Story continues The issue of 3D-printed guns has definitely resonated with Democrats in terms of safety. Plastic guns cannot be tracked by a government database, since they have no serial numbers, and theoretically could be mass-produced for illicit activities. Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a cease-and-desist order against DefCad Tuesday, and Democrats in the House and Senate filed legislation that would ban guns made from any 3D-printed material. How Would 3D-Printed Guns Work and be Regulated? The files that allow internet users to print 3D plastic guns were already available and downloaded thousands of times on DefCad’s website before it was federally blocked in a four-year court case between Defense Distributed and the US government. During legal limbo, the lines of code that 3D-printer owners could use to make guns were still exchanged on torrenting sites. But the State Department settled with DefCad, and the site promised that the “age of the downloadable gun” was upon us. The gun schematics that are available to download illegally right now include the AR-15 style weapon, along with an AR-10 assault-style rifle, a pistol called the “Liberator,” and a Ruger 10/22. It has yet to be made clear in a court of law whether lines of code can even count as free speech that necessitates constitutional protection. In fact, the ethical issues surrounding the 3D-printing of weapons has barely entered the public or legal consciousness before now. Until now, DefCad has undeniably been the victor of its legal battle with the US government to share files. Tuesday’s temporary block will do little, if anything, to stop the information that has already been shared and downloaded thousands of times online. No lawyer or judge has been able to put a stop to it since the site launched in 2012, and the Trump administration’s June settlement of this year laid a foundation for a successful First and Second Amendment argument for DefCad. Despite efforts of high-ranking Democrats, once the code reaches the internet, there’s no stopping it. The most realistic course for law enforcement moving forward is a comprehensive set of new regulations for possession, production, and sale of 3D-printed weapons.

Jon Tester (D-Mont.), and instead vote for a man who can “shoot straight.” “There’s two ways folks look at gun rights,” Rosendale said in the video. “Some folks, like me, shoot straight, support the Second Amendment, no apologies. Others, like Jon Tester, don’t.” Rosendale then shoves a thumb toward a billboard behind him that reads, “Article II” with language from the Constitution’s Second Amendment under it. “The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,” the sign reads. Article II of the Constitution establishes the executive branch of the federal government. Rosendale eventually produced a new video which showed the sign reading “Amendment II.” “When it comes to our gun rights, I’ll always side with you,” Rosendale says at the end of the video. Voters may want to make sure Rosendale knows which side that is. Love HuffPost? Become a founding member of HuffPost Plus today.

The Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program does not specifically prohibit weapons purchases and would allow DeVos to decide which states or school districts could use the funding for guns and training, sources told The New York Times on Wednesday. The $1 billion student support program is intended to fund the country’s poorest schools, the newspaper noted, adding that funds are typically allocated toward improving education curriculum, school conditions or technology for digital literacy. ADVERTISEMENT The Education Department would likely approve the gun purchases under the goal of improving school conditions, the sources told the Times. Schools that would reportedly receive fund would be encouraged to increase mental health counseling, create dropout prevention programs and help students acclimate from the juvenile justice system. “The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,” Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, told the newspaper. “The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” The move would be a historic break of precedent from the longstanding federal government policy of not to paying for weapons inside schools, the newspaper noted. Congress passed a bipartisan school safety bill earlier this year that created a new grant program to help educate students and teachers about warning signs for gun violence. School safety became a national talking point after the school shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Santa Fe, Texas earlier this year.

Trump established the White House school safety commission in March to “study and make recommendations” on several topics, such as age restrictions for certain gun purchases.

The students, with Teens for Gun Reform, took turns lying down for three minutes to symbolize “how quickly” the organization says suspected shooter Nikolas Cruz could have legally purchased the gun he allegedly used to kill 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14. “We have organized this protest in solidarity with all of those who were affected by the horrific school shooting in Florida,” the organization, which was formed following last week’s massacre, said in a statement posted on its Facebook page. “We call on President Trump and leaders from both parties to finally act in the interest of America’s youth and end these tragic mass shootings!” Dozens of teenagers participated in Monday’s lie-in. More than 700 people RSVP’d for the event on Facebook. Trump, who is spending the Presidents’ Day holiday weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, was not at the White House at the time of the protest.

A national school walkout organized by Stoneman Douglas students is planned for March 14. A separate walkout, organized by a Connecticut high school student, is scheduled for April 20 on what will be the 19th anniversary of the shootings at Columbine High School. And a “March For Our Lives” event, also organized by a group of students at Stoneman Douglas, is slated for March 24 in Washington. Each protest has a similar mission: to demand action on gun control. “We are going to make ourselves so loud and so brazen so they won’t be able to ignore us in the White House,” Delaney Tarr, a Stoneman Douglas senior who is helping to organize the “March For Our Lives” event, said on “CBS This Morning.” Story continues At a weekend rally in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on Saturday, Tarr and other survivors of last week’s shooting gave impassioned speeches calling for congressional action on guns. “They say that tougher gun laws do not decrease gun violence — we call B.S.!” Emma Gonzalez, another senior, said at the rally. “They say a good guy with a gun stops a bad guy with a gun — we call B.S.! They say guns are just tools like knives and are as dangerous as cars — we call B.S.! They say that no laws could have been able to prevent the hundreds of senseless tragedies that have occurred — we call B.S.!

It just happened in the last day and a half.” But Trump, Rubio and McConnell are dead wrong: Not forcing these conversations is, quite literally, a fatal mistake. ADVERTISEMENT Discussing gun violence has become so poisonous and polarizing that it exerts a strong impact on our everyday lives and personal relationships. Some Americans who have firearms safely stored in their home, won’t bring this topic up lest others think they are Second Amendment zealots with a basement bunker stocked for a coming ammo-pocalypse. Others don’t mention the “G-word” lest they be accused of being a “libtard.” This isn’t healthy — not confronting the reality that kids get shot when they play with unsecured firearms makes such accidents sure to happen. In more public contexts, our historical reluctance to force these conversations has made it more difficult to start them in the first place. It’s hard to have educated and informed exchanges thanks to the Dickey Amendment, a provision inserted into a 1996 federal spending bill mandating that no funds allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be used to “advocate or promote gun control” — enacting a de facto ban on gun violence research — resources the lack of which we literally “die for.” Our unwillingness to talk about guns and gun violence has even made it easy for states to make such discourse downright unlawful. Indiana state law, for example, bars public and private employers from asking employees about whether they own, use, or transport a gun, with no public safety exception. If they do, they can be slapped with a civil suit for economic damages, court costs, and even punitive damages. While this law might make gun owners more comfortable, it puts others at risk by preventing employers from adequately protecting other employees from at-risk colleagues. If Bob in marketing is suicidal, or threatens Mary down in sales, then Bob’s boss is in a really tough position, and might hesitate to ask Bob whether he has a firearm readily at hand in his car trunk in the parking lot. And that hesitation might be fatal. Such restrictions are particularly mystifying when the law affirmatively protects the right to discuss gun ownership, access, and safety — even though such conversations can be discomfiting. In Wollschlauger v. Governor of Florida, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit declared unconstitutional a Florida law that ostensibly protected “patient privacy” by prohibiting physicians from asking patients about their ownership and use of firearms. That law, the court held, violated physicians’ First Amendment rights, interfering with professional standards that require them to ask and educate about firearm ownership. Patients who were uncomfortable with such questions could refuse to answer — and such topics were certainly not the only difficult discussions to emerge in doctor-patient conversations. Our growing reluctance to talk about firearms and firearm violence doesn’t respect the Second Amendment; it turns it into a club used to bully others into silence and submission. This is the opposite of what the Second Amendment is intended to be — the constitutional provision that, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia put it in District of Columbia v. Heller, has “protected the rights of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” Using the Second Amendment as a silencer bastardizes it, undermining the civil discourse essential to democracy, creating and reinforcing a flawed narrative that fundamentally changes what people think gun ownership is about and warps popular understandings of the Second Amendment. That’s how we come to believe that “shall not infringe” means literally that no firearms regulations are permissible, equate gun safety education to gun-grabbing schemes, and misconstrue even pro-Second Amendment Supreme Court cases as unconstitutional judicial activism — all dangerous misconceptions that perpetuate and strengthen the politicization of Second Amendment issues and mass shootings. The first step in preventing gun violence — from domestic assaults with firearms to school shootings like Newtown and Parkland with high body counts — is to talk about them in meaningful ways that go beyond thoughts and prayers and Facebook posts to engagement and research. Without these resources, Second Amendment advocates and opponents won’t find common ground, and the majority of us who are caught in the middle can’t learn from these exchanges. These conversations might get messy, uncomfortable, emotional and downright infuriating, but have them we must. As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in Wollschlaeger, “[m]any are those who must endure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of freedom.” Jody L.

John. R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and the author of the new study, has always been skeptical of the research by Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama, whose work gained special prominence after then-President Barack Obama cited his study in remarks about the San Bernardino attack in December 2015. Lott raised alarm bells that Lankford, who found that between 1966 and 2012 the U.S. had 31 percent of public mass shooters in the world despite accounting for less than five percent of the population, did not do diligent research and refused to be transparent about his work, including not sharing his paper with others as he started his media blitz tour promoting the study in 2015. US GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES EXAGGERATE BENEFITS OF AUSTRALIA'S GUN RESTRICTIONS ""Here’s an amazing thing, [Lankford] refuses to provide his list of cases, he refuses to explain exactly how he got it. This is not just some normal academic study – President Obama many times cited this study as a source for his claims."" — John. R. Lott Jr. “Here’s an amazing thing, [Lankford] refuses to provide his list of cases, he refuses to explain exactly how he got it. This is not just some normal academic study – President Obama many times cited this study as a source for his claims. I can’t find any other academic research that’s gotten so much worldwide attention,” Lott told Fox News, adding that people across the world heard about the study. Despite that, the study became go-to research across the media, with the New York Times and CNN frequently citing it. Just this Wednesday, liberal news site Vox referenced a CNN article that cited Lankford’s work. Lankford declined an interview request about his study and told Fox News in an email that he’s “not interested in giving any serious thought to John Lott or his claims.” With little success to stop the myth of mass shootings as a uniquely American problem becoming ingrained across the world, Lott took the matter into his own hands, releasing a comprehensive study this week that debunks Lankford’s claims. ARMING TEACHERS A DECISION FOR STATES, LOCAL DISTRICTS, DEVOS SAYS After crunching the numbers, Lott concluded in his study that the U.S. accounts for less than three percent of the world’s mass public shootings over a 15-year period – between 1998 and 2012 – which is significantly lower than what Lankford’s work has shown. ""My most conservative count is well over three thousand shooters over just the last 15 years. My best count is that there were 10,800 of these public mass shooters over the last 15 years."" — John. R. Lott Jr. Lott said that he looked at the last 15 years rather than the last 47 years as Lankford did, because it’s nearly impossible to come up with perfectly accurate information about mass public shooters in, for example, Africa in the 1960s. “My most conservative count is well over three thousand shooters over just the last 15 years. My best count is that there were 10,800 of these public mass shooters over the last 15 years,” Lott said. Compare that with Lankford’s research, which found merely 292 mass public shooters over a 47-year period across the world, with 90 of those in the U.S., per his research. CALIFORNIA BILL TO EXPAND GUN-TAKEAWAY LAW ADVANCES TO GOVERNOR'S DESK Lott is committed to transparency about his study, listing every single case used in the research in a massive 451-page appendix of the study. He claims to have used the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, complimented by additional search tools to find cases that weren’t listed in the dataset. Of 1,491 mass public shootings reviewed by Lott, only 43 of those were in the U.S. This represents just 2.88 percent of all the cases. In per capita terms, the data put the U.S. below Finland, Norway or Switzerland. It’s still slightly higher than other Western countries such as France, Germany or the United Kingdom. Lankford’s main conclusion of his data was that there’s something in the American culture that makes people commit more public mass shootings than people in other cultures. For Lott, the actual data shows that the mass shooter problem in the U.S. is far from being a unique American experience. His question remains how the media and a president was able to get away with pushing a botched study published in a “low-rank journal” despite criticism.",Jacksonville Landing Jacksonville Landing shooting Video Games Madden NFL 19 Shooting Mass shooting    Game,"The First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., was the site of a mass shooting there in October 2015.","A widely-popularized study adopted by the Obama administration claiming the U.S. has by far the most mass public shooters in the world has been criticized and dismissed by new research.

What happened? According to the Sun-Sentinel, Lighthouse Point Police seized four firearms and more than 250 rounds of ammunition from a 56-year-old man who police determined was a “potential risk to himself or others."" In addition, the man was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital to undergo psychiatric treatment. Florida's Baker Act allows judges, law enforcement officers, and medical professors to temporarily commit residents for up to 72 hours who are deemed risks to themselves or others. Also, the man is prohibited from buying or possessing firearms and ammunition in the near future. What led to the order? The Sun-Sentinel has the details: Police were called after the man turned off the main electrical breakers to the condo building in Lighthouse Point, court records show. The South Florida Sun-Sentinel is not identifying the man because of his medical condition. The man told officers he “was being targeted and burglarized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a neighbor who lives in [his] building,” the judge wrote in his order. “[He] could not describe the neighbor but stated that the neighbor [can] ‘shape shift, he can change heights and I’m not sure where he comes from’ and ‘to be honest, he looks like Osama Bin Laden.’"" He also told officers that he had to turn off the electrical breakers because “they are electrocuting me through my legs. Lighthouse Point Police Chief Ross Licata told the Sun-Sentinel that law enforcement has had multiple encounters with the man, but he was never arrested prior to his commitment. ""I think this is what the general public has been looking for — for law enforcement to be able to intervene in these kinds of situations — for a long time,"" he said. Previously, officials were prohibited from seizing firearms from people they thought were dangers to themselves or others. According to the Sun-Sentinel, officials could be fined or removed from office if they did. What happens next? According to the new law, the officials who seized the man's firearms are due in court on March 28. At that hearing, a judge will determine whether or not the man's firearms and ammunition should remain in police possession for the next year. At the hearing, police will need to present ""clear and convincing"" evidence to prove the seizure needs to remain in place. Police will have to present additional evidence to strengthen their case if they want the seizure to remain in place.

REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo By Ross Kerber BOSTON (Reuters) - Funds run by BlackRock Inc <BLK.N> and Vanguard Group backed all directors at gunmaker Sturm Ruger & Co Inc <RGR.N> despite the company's rare rejection of talks with the world's top asset managers, disclosures to regulators on Thursday showed. The votes by the gunmaker's largest investors stood in contrast to support BlackRock and Vanguard gave to a measure calling on Sturm Ruger to report on the safety of its products, which passed over the board's objections at the company's annual meeting on May 9. Neither BlackRock nor Vanguard would discuss in detail their votes at the meeting. It drew attention amid a nationwide youth-led gun control movement following a mass shooting at a Florida high school in February that killed 17 people, one in a decades-long series of shootings at U.S. schools, colleges and workplaces. Sturm Ruger declined to comment on the filings by the funds with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. BlackRock holds about 18 percent of shares outstanding, followed by Vanguard, with about 10 percent. Both fund firms rarely vote against directors, and say critical votes may come only after companies fail to respond to shareholder concerns. Since July, BlackRock and Vanguard said in separate ""investment stewardship"" reports that they had held talks with other U.S. public companies that make or sell civilian firearms. Investors and activists with a range of views about gun control said the asset managers' split tickets seemed to reflect an approach designed to appeal to young investors concerned with social issues, without alienating clients who own guns or pushing Sturm Ruger's board too quickly. The big fund firms ""have to look at sensitivities"" of their clients and business partners, said Brian Rafn, principal of Morgan Dempsey Capital Management in Milwaukee, who described himself as a gun-rights supporter and says the firm voted all its 80,000 or so shares with Sturm Ruger's management. Eli Kasargod-Staub, co-founder of Majority Action, a group that had campaigned for top funds to vote against Sturm Ruger director Sandra Froman, a past president of the National Rifle Association, called the votes ""a failure of leadership"" by the fund managers. ""The only plausible explanation to me is that they were simply trying to avoid controversy,"" he said. BlackRock spokeswoman Tara McDonnell said via email it takes a case-by-case approach to its engagement and voting ""because doing so encourages change over time and promotes responsible business practices that align with the financial interests of our clients."" In a statement emailed by spokeswoman Carolyn Wegemann, Vanguard said that while a company's willingness to engage can affect its voting decisions, corporate moves to improve shareholder value ""may unfold over the course of a few years, rather than a few months."" Sturm Ruger is unusual in that its executives and directors will not talk with investors directly, at a time both big passive managers have stressed more engagement with companies in their portfolios. Sturm Ruger Chief Executive Officer Christopher Killoy at the May meeting said it does not meet with top holders including BlackRock and Vanguard because of fair-disclosure rules, a rare stance. BlackRock voted against Exxon directors over similar discussion limits in the past, and BlackRock CEO Larry Fink earlier this year told CEOs that ""engagement needs to be a year-round conversation about improving long-term value."" BlackRock and Vanguard said they would contact gunmakers after the Florida shooting. Sturm Ruger said previously its directors each won more than 10 million votes at the May 9 meeting. The most votes withheld from any director was 425,763. Thursday's filings showed funds including BlackRock's iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF <IJR.P> and Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund <VB.P> voted for all nine directors, and for the safety report. In a July 20 ""investment stewardship"" report BlackRock said it had talks with ""nearly all"" 13 U.S. public gun manufacturers or sellers. The company also said that at one unidentified gunmaker that did not allow shareholder talks, it voted for a safety report. Vanguard's similar report in mid-August said that during the 12 months ended June 30, it spoke with three gunmakers and supported a shareholder resolution calling for more risk disclosure at a company it did not identify. Vanguard wrote that in its outreach, ""our objective is not to change what business a company is in or what product it produces, but rather to ensure that the risks of these choices are understood by the market and reflected in the company's long-term value to investors.""

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. President Donald Trump on Thursday said there were ""many signs"" the suspected shooter in the horrific attack at a high school in Parkland, Florida, was mentally disturbed and that his classmates should have reported him to authorities. ""So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,"" Trump tweeted, referring to 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, who was charged Thursday with 17 counts of pre-meditated murder. ""Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!"" Later Thursday, in a nationally televised speech, Trump announced he would visit Parkland, Fla., and that ""our entire nation, with one heavy heart, is praying for the victims and their families."" Trump made no reference to guns or the AR-15 believed to have been used in the attack in his tweets or in his speech. At least 17 people were killed when a teen opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle at the high school on Wednesday afternoon, officials said. Fourteen others were wounded, five of whom suffering life-threatening injuries, hospital officials said. Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky responded to Trump's tweet just moments after he posted it, when it was read to her during a live interview on CNN, saying, ""If a solution was simple for these things, we would have found one already."" Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha Trump tweeted twice on Wednesday about the school shooting, after news of it broke, but did not make any on-camera remarks about the attack. The White House also canceled its daily press briefing Wednesday after the shooting, although on Thursday morning, the White House released a ""proclamation honoring the victims"" of the shooting. ""Our Nation grieves with those who have lost loved ones in the shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida,"" Trump said in the statement. He also ordered flags be flown at half-staff. A senior administration official also said White House advisers were discussing a possible visit by Trump to the area during his previously scheduled trip to his Mar-a-Lago estate this weekend. Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where the attack occurred, is about 40 miles from Mar-a-Lago. Meanwhile, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), in an interview Thursday morning with Fox News Channel’s ""Fox and Friends"" called the suspect a ""deeply disturbed person"" and ""someone that people knew was a danger."" ""You know, someone that in the school there was this running joke, it’s not a joke anymore obviously, but a running joke that he was gonna come back one day and hurt a lot of people,"" he said. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, during a previously scheduled speech to a group of sheriffs in Washington, D.C., admitted Thursday that ""it cannot be denied that something dangerous and unhealthy is happening."" ""It is too often the case that the perpetrators of these terrible attacks had given of signals in advance,"" he said. ""Perhaps we haven’t been effective enough in intervening immediately. I suspect we’ve seen that again in this case...we cannot arrest everybody that somebody thinks is dangerous."" Trump has previously blamed mass shootings on mental health issues. In November, he said the mass shooting at a church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, ""isn't a guns situation"" but instead ""a mental health problem at the highest level."" Just weeks into his presidency, however, Trump signed a bill rolling back a regulation that had made it harder for people with mental illnesses to buy firearms. Trump has previously directed blame at the neighbors of other mass shooters. Following the December 2015 shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., he repeatedly claimed, without providing any evidence, that the neighbors of shooters Syed Farook and his wife, Tashmin Malik, knew of the attack. ""Many people saw the bombs all over the apartment (in San Bernardino), Muslims have to report the problems when they see them,"" Trump said during a presidential debate. Trump struck a more solemn tone in addressing the nation after the Las Vegas shooting last October, referring to scripture, dubbing the attack ""an act of pure evil"" and calling for national unity, in a nationally televised address just hours after the attack. A day after the Las Vegas shooting, however, Trump called the shooter a ""sick and demented man"" and punted on questions over the whether the attack should prompt stricter gun control laws. Cruz had recently been expelled from the school for disciplinary reasons and was enrolled elsewhere in the district, Broward County schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said. The gunman was believed to have been armed with a AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and multiple magazines, according to Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel.",Nikolas Cruz Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Stoneman Douglas High School shooting School shooting Shooting School Thoughts and prayers Gun violence Student Mass shooting,"A photo of the suspect in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday.","Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Kavanaugh walked away from the father of Jaime Guttenberg, who was among 17 people murdered in the Valentine's Day rampage at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. The encounter sparked a range of responses from Twitter users, with many suggesting that it was a visual representation of where conservatives stand on gun control reform. But on Friday, the issue of gun violence was upon Kavanaugh again when the Senate Judiciary Committee heard an emotional testimony from Stoneman Douglas survivor Aalayah Eastmond. Kavanaugh has defended his dissent in a case related to a ban on semi-automatic rifles—the weapon of choice in the Parkland slayings. Still, the judge, whose two daughters joined him (for a time) at the hearings, says he knows the U.S. must address gun violence. Not convinced: Eastmond, who spoke at the March For Our Lives rally and became a youth advocate with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and student-led Team ENOUGH. Eastmond was appalled by the judge’s refusal to engage with Jaime’s dad at the hearing: “The amount of disrespect is unimaginable, and this is who, ‘so-called President’ nominated,” tweeted the Parkland senior. “See you Friday Kavanaugh.” At the hearing, she used the horror she had seen at her own school (she hid under the body of a dead classmate to survive the shooting), and also the loss of an uncle to a shooting in Brooklyn, New York, to raise questions about Kavanaugh's views on gun control: ""As you make your final decision, think about it as if you had to justify and defend your choice to those who we lost to gun violence,"" she urged the committee in her prepared remarks. Story continues On the eve of her Senate testimony, Eastmond talked to Glamour about her decision to speak against Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Here are the highlights, in her own words. I'm here to testify at Kavanaugh's hearing [so] people can understand that gun violence is an everyday problem… Lives are being taken every day. And not only that, but lives in urban communities, every day. I was there on February 14th. And I was in Room 1214, which was the third classroom the shooter shot into, and I had to hide underneath one of my deceased classmate's bodies to survive. That is the story that I'm sharing [so] people can understand that it's not, you know, normal. And it shouldn't be normalized. I saw things that nobody should have seen and that nobody should have to see in their lifetime. Being in school, [a] place where you should feel safe and you're learning—in fact, I was in Holocaust History [class], learning about hate and terror. And just to experience that right after going over [a] hate groups project was just unimaginable, and a coincidence. Hearing gunshots and not knowing what gunshots sound like. Not knowing what to do and then just thinking in a survival-mode type of way to do what I did, which was hide underneath a body. Smelling the gunpowder and seeing the smoke, and seeing the red on the floor and having flesh and body matter in my hair. At the age of 17 in school — [well] I was 16 at the time — that shouldn't be. I shouldn't have to be talking about this, and I'm not the only one that has this story. There's people all over the country that share similar stories. It's something that nobody wants to talk about — and it's something that I am forced to talk about every day. [It’s] not only just what I experienced, but the fact that black and brown youth are disproportionately impacted by gun violence every day. I don't think [Kavanaugh] should be [a] Supreme Court judge. Period. [If] we're gonna have a judge on the highest court of the land, they need to be a judge that recognizes the issue of gun violence and the epidemic that the youth is experiencing every day, and he doesn't recognize that it's a problem, so I don't think he should be getting that seat. [Based on] his comments towards the Second Amendment, he doesn't believe it should be altered or changed at all because it's ""a well-regulated militia"" and everybody deserves the right to own a gun. But I disagree, because your freedom to own a gun is not more important than my freedom to live. If he doesn't have the decency to shake a hand of a father of a victim, he definitely will not have the decency to make changes and decisions that will impact the lives of people every day… I honestly just think we need a different nominee. I think we've seen enough of Kavanaugh, and I don't think we should wait any longer for him to say anything else, because we clearly know what his stance is on the Second Amendment and other things as well. I'm sure Fred Guttenberg [father of Parkland student Jaime Guttenberg] would have loved to bring his daughter. Fred had a daughter, too, that lost her life on February 14. And I don't appreciate Kavanaugh not addressing that. I feel like he will [not] recognize that it's an issue until he loses one of his kids, or until he loses a family member, so he understands the pain and the way that it impacts you and that it's senseless. So that's how I look at it: [Kavanaugh] can bring his kids wherever, but don't wait until your kids are gone for you to care. I have faith that he will not [be confirmed]. I hope he doesn't, but I can't tell the future. All I know is that we're [going] to share our stories and our views and opinions on him, and hopefully they hear us out and they take action. At times, it's frustrating, because I shouldn't have this story and I shouldn't have had to experienced that. But it is important that I share my story, so people can again get a different perspective and understand that it is an issue that impacts everybody — no matter the color of their skin or where they live. It is a problem in America, and it needs to be fixed. Right now, I'm okay, because I have my fellow Team ENOUGH members supporting me here. So I'm not worried, and I know that we are stronger than Kavanaugh and any of his views, and I know that we can take him down, no matter what. You can watch Eastmond's full testimony, here.

It wasn’t anything fancy; a few guys and gals hooted and hollered over beers in the corner of the bar, duking it out in pairs of two, either in front of a tiny TV or a projector screen. Some were regulars, who’d been schlepping their controllers and consoles to this King Street venue since it was a laundromat and bar, well before last year, when it became a dedicated barcade called Keg & Coin. Others were just curious and asked to hop in for a quick round of Smash. It was like a lot of other Jacksonville gaming events: smaller affairs that happen almost nightly and usually take place at one of three mainstay arcades in town, or at a less formal locale like someone’s apartment, where this competitive gaming community got its roots. But of course, this night was different. Some of the folks watching the tournament wore shirts or pins bearing the name GLHF ― the arcade just over two miles away at Jacksonville Landing where, less than 24 hours prior, a mass shooting at a Madden tournament left three dead and another 11 wounded. Keg & Coin, then, was the obvious setting for them to gather and mourn together; to revel; to plot their next steps; to just get their mind off things. “We needed somewhere to get together and hang out ― now this is one of the only places to do that,” said Joshua “Tyger” Campbell, 35, who’s been hosting competitions in town for nearly two decades. “In Jacksonville, this scene used to be so underground. But in the past three to five years we’ve had so much community organizing and so many events that we’re stronger. We have so many places now where gamers feel safe to congregate.” They also wanted to point out the strength of this community. Campbell said he was excited that a national gaming tournament was being held at one of his local haunts. It signaled that the community he’d helped to start, with small Dance Dance Revolution tournaments held back in 2003, was thriving. Story continues But then came the shooting, one that would undoubtedly change the message about his community. This was, after all, a shooting at a video game tournament, and gaming has been a punching bag and a boogeyman for politicians since shooting at Columbine. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has continued that storied tradition, vowing earlier this year to look into the connection between video games and mass shootings. Surely, this real-world, violent event would breed more mischaracterizations about video game culture. “It’s just heartbreaking,” said Mark Ronan, 22, who organizes gaming events across the city. “GLHF is here so we can have a place to hold awesome events like the Madden tournament. One of Jacksonville’s opportunities to shine in the esports world was soiled, and made headlines for all the wrong reasons.” The people HuffPost spoke to Monday ― gaming advocates and activists, family and friends of those victims still hospitalized ― wanted to paint a different picture of local gaming. They’ve spent years fostering a culture of charity, entertainment and competition that extends well beyond the shooting at Jacksonville Landing. ’This Is His Dream’ Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo poses with Florida Gov. Rick Scott from his hospital bed in Jacksonville. (Photo: Courtesy of Sujeil Lopez) At the University of Florida Health medical center, Sujeil Lopez told reporters that she used to get upset when her son, 26-year-old Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo, played video games for a dozen hours a day or more where he grew up in New York City. “I used to get mad,” she said. “My husband used to say, ‘He could be outside doing a lot worse, leave him alone!’ I used to be so furious. But he went to high school, went to college, and he’s a good man.” Anselimo now makes a living playing NBA 2K competitively and boasts a sponsorship from the Milwaukee Bucks. Lopez created a Twitter account just to follow and support his career. She’s fully on board. “This is his dream ― his life,” Lopez said, a life that was put on hold when her son was shot three times on Sunday, once in the chest, once in the hip and again in his right hand. Lopez spoke to reporters as he went through surgery on that hand, a procedure which would decide whether he could continue his career. “As a mother you want your child to be brave,” she said. “If he can’t play and he can’t work, his life would be changed forever. ... But look forward to seeing him again. This is not the last you’ll see of oLARRY, I promise you that!” In the same hospital where Lopez spoke, another group of friends and family was waiting on Chris “Dubby” McFarland to recover. The world-renowned Madden player was grazed in the head by a bullet on Sunday. His friend, John Washington, said outside the ER that McFarland’s gaming community, and sense of safety, had been “invaded.” “He’s very emotional, his whole family is emotional. He’s a soldier, but now it’s like, where in America can you go and feel safe anymore?” Washington said. “The gamers really appreciated this event coming to town. This was just so catastrophic for all of them and the Jacksonville community as a whole.” McFarland, he said, was expected to be released from the hospital sometime this week. But his side career in gaming may be put on hold. ‘Gaming’s Not Going Anywhere’ From left to right: Kyle Schmisek, Joshua Campbell and Mark Ronan, at Keg & Coin in Jacksonville. (Photo: Andy Campbell/HuffPost) There’s rehabilitation to be done, but luckily for the gamers in town, there’s already a network in place to do that. Before the shooting, they had Games Art And Music, a gaming culture company that melds local entertainment with events; the Jacksonville chapter of Extra Life, which raises money for local pediatric programs through gaming events; and locals like Campbell and Ronan, who are already preparing to host charity events for their people. “A lot of people have questions about how they can help, or how we can increase safety at our events ... it encourages me,” Ronan said. “We have to bring everyone back together to show that something like this isn’t going to stop us from having a good time and doing what we love.” Kyle Schmisek, 32, who hosts trivia at GLHF, said calls were rolling in from people wanting to donate to the arcade and various victims’ funds. Over the course of 24 hours, he went from a local organizer in gaming to a national one. “It needs to be done so I do it,” he said. “I’ve been sitting around waiting to do something other than just donate, so I’m here to help. But there’s still a lot to be done. We want to help these families, and we’re still working on that.” Schmisek, Campbell and Ronan sat around a table outside Keg & Coin as the Smash Bros. tournament wrapped up, talking shop and devising plans on what to do next. When asked whether the shooting changed anything for them in terms of their involvement in the scene, they each laughed. “This is my livelihood,” Ronan said. “I work at a game shop, I host events, I travel for them. I put a lot of my effort into Smash. I wouldn’t give it up for anything.” Campbell agreed. “Gaming’s not going anywhere for me,” he said. Love HuffPost?

696,696,10610,http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/390501-gun-violence-is-a-disease-has-dc-found-a-solution,Gun violence is a disease — has DC found a cure?,"In the wake of several high-profile police shootings, and as the momentum of the youth-led gun control movement continues to carry forward, the American public is taking a renewed interest in solutions to the wicked problems of public safety, gun violence, and police accountability. It’s become increasingly clear that we must work to address these problems in a way that acknowledges links between violence, racism, and public safety. As my colleague and Institute for Policy Studies Associate Fellow Ebony Slaughter-Johnson noted earlier this spring, American police killed more people last year than mass shooters. Where can we find holistic solutions? ADVERTISEMENT In the run-up to the March for Our Lives this March, the students of Stoneman Douglas High School proposed a gun control policy manifesto published in The Guardian. While it’s impressive in its scope, especially as the product of a group of young people, critics have made clear that some of the students’ suggested solutions would violate the privacy of the mentally ill and result in more aggressive policing. More aggressive policing tactics can’t be the answer, of course: We know that they disproportionately harm communities of color and ultimately lead to more violence. “The status quo of policing and mass incarceration have failed,” says Eugene Puryear of Stop Police Terror Project DC. “Study after study has shown us that mass incarceration and policing do not significantly reduce violence or other crime while carrying significant financial and social costs — that’s why a different approach is so important.” Treating gun violence as a public health crisis is the leading edge of this new approach, and one that is gaining traction across the country, including in the nation’s capital. It could ultimately reduce America’s incarceration rate through rethinking our approach to crime prevention. The Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results (NEAR) Act, a law passed by the D.C. Council in 2016 modeled on this approach, seeks to identify and address the root causes of crime while moving away from the failed status quo of policing and punishment that lead to increased arrests and incarceration — as well as the harassment and targeting of communities of color — while doing nothing to keep people safe. ADVERTISEMENT Yet despite passing the D.C. Council unanimously in 2016, the NEAR Act is still awaiting full implementation by Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration. There are three community-driven prongs to violence prevention in the NEAR Act: First, the law requires Community Crime Prevention Teams of behavioral health professionals to work in communities to identify people with signs of mental illness or substance abuse and connect them with existing services outside of the criminal legal system. Second, the law requires a newly-established Office of Violence Prevention and Health Equity to prevent the viral spread of violence by bringing therapy and social service coordination directly to victims of interpersonal violence while they’re still in hospitals. Third, a newly-established Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement is tasked with identifying and directly engaging with individuals at high risk of committing or falling victim to violence — and then providing individualized, wrap-around services to equip those individuals with the treatment, training, and support necessary to allow those at risk move towards a safer life. Alongside these components, the NEAR Act includes several elements to increase police accountability and recalibrate the strained relationship between neighborhood police and highly-policed communities. From expanding data collection and reporting requirements to prescribing training on bias and cultural competencies, it’s a clear mandate for police to work to repair their ways of relating with areas that have suffered from harassment and police violence for years. Here’s the best part: This broad, community-led approach has been a success across America already. In Richmond, Calif., where this approach was pioneered, gun violence was reduced by over 70 percent in just three years. New York City piloted a similar model in five neighborhoods, and the success led to its expansion into nearly 20 neighborhoods. After that expansion, the city saw its lowest level of gun violence in three decades. Other rigorous studies have proven that hospital-based violence intervention programs like the one in the NEAR Act succeed at reducing gun violence. This model is a replicable way to reduce gun violence. It deserves to be taken seriously. So what’s the hold up in the District? With this community-based approach already bearing such fruit nationwide, and holding such watershed potential for a different approach to public safety, why is the nation’s capital holding back at implementing the NEAR Act? “Since the NEAR Act became law, Mayor Bowser has consistently refused to fully or faithfully implement its life-saving approaches,” says April Goggans of Black Lives Matter DC. “We’d like to see these policies implemented in substance, to really transform what’s happening in our communities and get the results we know are possible. Unfortunately, despite being law for over two years, we’re still waiting for the NEAR Act to be implemented in substance.” The movement to combat gun violence in America is reaching a high watermark. With luck, wisdom, and momentum, one outcome could be a new approach to public safety that reduces violence without increasing America’s incarceration rate, addresses root causes, and empowers individuals and communities to thrive.

He recently sat down with NRA TV host and guns rights activist Colion Noir to defend gun ownership and said he discouraged his children from taking part in the high school walkouts from earlier this month. ""I told my kids on the school walkout: 'I love you but if you walk out that school, walk out my house.'"" The Run The Jewels MC is known for his strong political stances on racism, mass incarceration, and other issues, and while this interview might have caught some by surprise, he's been an outspoken NRA supporter (and member) for quite some time. In Mike's view, the important discussions about gun control should include voices from both sides. He also said that gun owners want violence against children to end, though they disagree on how to achieve that. ""I have worked as a tireless advocate of children and disenfranchised women in my community. And I have also worked with gun groups like Georgians Against Gun Violence [...] If there's a table to be sat at, the gun owner needs to be there, so I try to see the problem from the whole perspective,"" he said in the clip. Mike and the host echoed similar ideas and claimed that though they may be viewed as ""lackeys"" for the NRA, the onus of that title is actually on everyone else. “You’re a lackey of the progressive movement because you’ve never disagreed with the people who tell you what to do,” the rapper explained.

205,205,110297,https://nz.news.yahoo.com/jemel-roberson-demands-justice-chicago-101733876.html,Jemel Roberson: Demands for justice after Chicago police shoot dead 'hero'black security guard who successfully detained gunman,"The family of a “hero” security guard who apprehended a gunman in a bar before being shot dead by police has filed a $1m lawsuit. Jemel Roberson, 26, was shot after he chased down the attacker in the bar in a Chicago suburb, and knelt on his back until the police arrived. The incident occurred at roughly 4am on Sunday, after another security guard told a group of drunk men to leave the premises. Witnesses said someone then returned to the bar with a gun and began shooting, resulting in four people being shot. Roberson, the father of a nine-month-old boy, then managed to apprehend one of the suspects outside the bar, and knelt on his back until the police arrived. Moments after the officers arrived on the scene, one opened fire and shot the security guard dead. He was reportedly holding his own licensed gun and wearing a hat emblazoned with “Security” across the front when the police officer opened fire. When police arrived, Roberson was holding “somebody on the ground with his knee in his back, with his gun in his back,” witness Adam Harris told WGN-TV. “Everybody is screaming out, ‘He’s a security guard,”’ Mr Harris said. “He was protecting the club and holding a suspect down,” Mr Harris added to CBS. Roberson was pronounced dead shortly after being taken to a hospital early on Sunday. Four other people were shot and wounded, including a man who authorities believe fired a gun before officers arrived, Cook County sheriff’s spokeswoman Sophia Ansari said. Attorney Gregory Kulis filed the civil rights lawsuit, seeking more than $1m on behalf of Roberson’s mother, Beatrice Roberson. “A Midlothian officer encountered a subject with a gun and was involved in an officer-involved shooting. The subject the officer shot was later pronounced deceased at an area hospital,” Daniel Delaney, the chief of the Midlothian Police Department, said in a statement posted on the department’s Facebook page. Illinois State Police are handling the investigation into Roberson’s shooting. The agency said it would not comment on the investigation until it is completed. While Roberson had a valid firearms owners’ identification card, he did not, however, have a concealed carry permit, police said. The Reverend Marvin Hunter said Roberson was “an upstanding young man” and a promising keyboard player at his and several other area churches. Roberson was trying to “get enough money together for a deposit on a new apartment,” said Reverend Hunter, the great-uncle of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager fatally shot by a white Chicago police officer in a high-profile 2014 case. Roberson also had hopes of becoming a police officer, according to his son’s mother. “This was going to be my baby’s first Christmas with his dad and now he’s going to miss out on everything,” said Avontea Boose. Roberson is one of at least 840 people who have been shot and killed by police so far in 2018 and one of at least 19 in Illinois, according to a Washington Post database. The paper said at least 181 of those shot and killed by police this year – 22 percent – were black. The US population is about 13 per cent black.

The town of 16,000, which touts itself as the Pumpkin Capital of the World, is protective of its image as a family-friendly village with grand homes and a leisurely pace of life. The town’s website boasts its recognition as “One of the Top 10 Places to Raise a Family” by Family Circle Magazine in 2013. Agricultural and industrial giants such as Caterpillar Inc. are the major employers of the area. But that image was marred after Nashville authorities announced a 29-year-old Morton native was the suspect in Sunday’s restaurant rampage, which left four dead and four injured. The man fled after a customer wrestled his gun away. Advertisement Travis Reinking was taken into custody without incident nearly 34 hours after the deadly shooting, Nashville police said. He was found near his Nashville apartment with a backpack that police said contained a semiautomatic firearm as well as ammunition. What could have motivated the shooting remained unknown, authorities said. Reinking is now charged with four counts of criminal homicide. “It’s not the way you want your town to be advertised,” said a woman who has lived in Morton since 1991. She said she was stunned when she saw her hometown flash across the television. “I saw Morton right across there, and I said, ‘Oh, no,’” said the woman, who was walking her dog in town Monday. She said she did not want to be identified because she didn’t want to be associated with the incident. “I just think he needed help and didn’t get it. Just another one of those sad stories.” Advertisement Reinking was regarded as somewhat of a loner, considered socially awkward by some. He came from a Christian family and was home-schooled, but he also took some classes at nearby Tremont High School. Reinking took a strong interest in photography and was often seen in town with a camera. Reinking’s encounters with law enforcement before the Waffle House shooting were largely unknown to many until reporters being to pry into his background. Reports released by the Tazewell County Sheriff’s Office show at least three instances when Reinking’s father, Jeffrey Reinking, took away his son’s guns, only to later return them. In August 2017, Reinking was arrested by the U.S. Secret Service after authorities said he crossed a restricted area near the White House, saying he wanted to meet President Trump. He was not armed, but the FBI requested that Illinois State Police revoke his firearm owner’s identification card. Advertisement Reinking handed over his FOID card to officers and transferred four weapons, along with ammunition, to his father, according to an Illinois State Police Firearm Disposition Record. The weapons were a 9-millimeter handgun, an AR-15 rifle, a .22-caliber rifle and another rifle. Reinking’s father acknowledged to officials that he gave the weapons back to his son, said Don Aaron, a Nashville police spokesman. Special Agent Marcus Watson of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Reinking’s father could face criminal charges. Following another incident in June 2017, Jeffrey Reinking again told authorities he would take his son’s guns away. At that time, Travis Reinking was spotted taking off a dress, jumping into a Tremont swimming pool and yelling at people, according to a Tazewell County sheriff’s report. He had been seen throwing a rifle into the trunk of his car that same day, according to the report. No charges were filed. Advertisement An officer wrote in the report that he called the father and advised him “he might want to lock the guns back up until Travis gets mental help.” A year before, on May 27, 2016, the Sheriff’s Office responded to a CVS parking lot in Morton because Travis Reinking reported that he thought singer Taylor Swift was stalking him. His family told police that Travis Reinking had made suicidal comments and had access to multiple weapons, according to the report. The shooting at the Waffle House already has Illinois lawmakers rethinking legislation. Earlier this year, the Illinois Senate passed the Lethal Violence Order of Protection Act, but state representatives are rewriting the bill and renaming it the Firearm Restraining Order. It’s similar to “red flag” bills that have gained traction in the wake of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. The bills allow a relative, friend or law enforcement officer to report someone in distress whose guns need to be temporarily taken away. Advertisement Because of the Waffle House shooting, Illinois state Rep. Kathleen Willis (D-Addison) said Monday that lawmakers were revisiting whether the person should be allowed to transfer the weapons to someone like a relative or whether the guns should be seized by a law enforcement agency in every case. The proposed bill would suspend a person’s FOID card for six months, and the revision of the proposed bill provides more details about due process for the person whose weapons have been confiscated. “We want the act to really get the person the help they need,” she said. “We don’t want it to be a punitive act. We want them to get the help they need while still protecting the 2nd Amendment.” In Morton, meanwhile, residents said they are trying to distance themselves from the violence in Nashville, but the news is simply inescapable. Advertisement At the home of one of Reinking’s relatives in Morton, the Peoria Journal Star lay on the front porch, stuffed into a translucent, peach-colored casing. The front page featured a photo of an investigator ducking under the crime scene tape outside the Nashville Waffle House. The headline read “Police: Morton Man Killed Four in Tennessee.” Daniel Reinking, Travis’ Reinking’s great-uncle, said he hadn’t been in touch with the family in several years, but learned what was going on from the blitz of media coverage. “It was shock, of course, and disbelief,” Daniel Reinking said. Many in Morton simply didn’t want to discuss the shooting, let alone acknowledge Reinking as one of their own.

Witnesses said the gunman, Adam Purinton, angrily confronted Kuchibhotla and another Indian national Alok Madasani at an Austin’s Bar & Grill in Olathe, Kansas, yelling “Get out of my country!” Purinton then shot eight rounds inside the restaurant, killing Kuchibhotla and wounding his friend Madasani. A third man, identified as Kansas resident Ian Grillot, was also shot after he tried to stop Purinton outside the bar. Before shooting, Purinton reportedly asked the men, who he thought were Iranian, about their immigration status. When he was located by police, at a bar more than 80 miles away from the crime scene, he told officers he had killed “two Middle Eastern men.” In May, Purinton agreed to a plea deal that recommended the maximum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the hate crime and firearm offenses against him. In turn, prosecutors agreed to not pursue a death sentence. “No matter who you are, what you believe, or how you worship, you should be able to live without fear of becoming a victim of hate crimes, We hope today’s sentencing brings some closure for the victims and their families,” U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister for the District of Kansas said Tuesday in a statement. The new sentence comes on top of a separate life sentence given to Purinton after he pleaded guilty to state charges of murder and attempted murder. All the counts are to be served consecutively, according to court documents. Here’s what else we know. Prosecutors have pointed to an earlier incident weeks before the shooting In its statement today, the Justice Department said that Purinton “admitted in open court” at his federal guilty-plea hearing months ago “that he targeted and shot Kuchibhotla and Madasani because of their race, color, and national origin.” In a statement from the department in May, prosecutors also pointed to a separate incident weeks before the shooting. Purinton happened to be at Austin’s Bar & Grill at the same time as Kuchibhotla and Madasani, sitting by himself in the bar area while the two Indian men were having a drink on the patio. All three were known to frequent the restaurant after work. “Noticing the two men, Purinton commented to a regular sitting at the bar, ‘Did you see the terrorists on the patio?'” according to the statement. How did the shooting happen? On the evening of Feb. 22, 2017, Purinton was sitting by himself on the front patio of Austin’s Bar & Grill. Kuchibhotla and Madasani were also sitting nearby. He then approached to two men, demanding to know their immigration statuses. “Out of the blue comes this weird-looking gentleman, I say weird-looking because he had anger on his face,” Madasani, 32, later told The New York Times. “I did not hear what he was saying instantly, but I saw the look on Srinivas’s face change drastically. I looked at Adam and he walked towards me, he came to me and said, ‘Are you here legally?’” According to DOJ, Purinton poked Kuchibhotla in the chest, calling him a “terrorist” and other racist epithets. Witnesses at one point heard Purinton shout: “Get out of my country!” Ian Grillot, 24, and another bar patron interceded and escorted Purinton out of the bar. “Everybody kept coming up to us saying ‘This is not what we represent, you guys belong here.'” “Everybody kept coming up to us saying ‘This is not what we represent, you guys belong here,’” Madasani recounted for the Times, saying that other patrons assured them that he and his friend were welcomed at the bar. Purinton, however, drove home to retrieve a semi-automatic pistol. He changed into a different shirt and wore a blue and white scarf, all in an effort to “disguise his identity,” the DOJ said. About 30 minutes later, he returned and shot eight rounds at Kuchibhotla and Madasani on the patio. Four of the bullets struck Kuchibhotla, who later died from his injuries. Madasani was shot once, but survived. As Purinton fled the scene, Grillot tried to catch him. Purinton shot Grillot, who also survived the attack. After the shooting, Purinton “stated over the phone to a friend, and later in person to a bartender, that he had just killed some Iranians,” the DOJ said. The fallout The attack raised concerns about anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S. and even caught the attention of Indian officials. They and local media wondered if America was a safe place for Indians. Sunayana Dumala, Kuchibhotla’s widow, addressed this in court today via a statement that was read by a prosecutor. Dumala wrote that it was “extremely painful” to face the gunman. She did address Purinton directly in the statement: “If you could have kept your anger inside and spoke to my husband softly, Srinu would have been more than happy to share his background and help you understand that not every brown skinned person is suspicious or evil, but kind, smart and contributing to America,” she wrote. “Instead you chose to rage and bully in anger and when you were stopped, you decided to take their lives,” she added. None of the victims were present for the sentencing, The Kansas City Star reported. In a video produced by the Star after Purinton’s sentencing in May, Dumala said the “murder of my husband will not bring back Srinu to me, but it will send out a very strong message that hate is never acceptable.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions also called the hate crime “detestable” in today’s statement. “While we cannot undo the irreparable harm that this defendant has done, some measure of justice for the victims’ families has been achieved. Such hateful crimes will remain a priority for the Department of Justice,” he said.

The rally was the culmination of three days of grief and anger that followed the attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, roughly 25 miles north of Fort Lauderdale, which left 17 people dead and 14 others injured. But amid speeches from elected officials and school administrators, it was students — the survivors of the shooting — who led calls to restrict access to firearms. The aftermath of mass shootings in America have become familiar. Democrats call for gun control, hashtags in solidarity with survivors trend on social media and many call for thoughts and prayers. But following this week's shooting in Parkland, the students who survived are not content with thoughts and prayers. ""The people in the government who are voted into power are lying to us. And us kids seem to be the only ones who notice and our parents to call 'B.S.,' "" Emma Gonzalez, a student at the school, said. ""We are prepared to call 'B.S.' "" Gonzalez delivered an emotional plea for new gun restrictions in a speech on Saturday, blasting President Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he would be comfortable sending son, grandchildren to school in person Cafeteria worker on White House grounds tests positive for COVID-19: reports Republicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday MORE, the National Rifle Association (NRA) and lawmakers for what she called their self-serving and ultimately hollow responses to the shooting. Many students held signs demanding new action on gun control. ""My friend died for what?"" read one sign. ""Stop gun violence now,"" read another. The suspected shooter was identified Wednesday as 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the high school who was expelled for disciplinary reasons. Cruz later confessed to carrying out the attack. He was charged Thursday with 17 counts of premeditated murder. ADVERTISEMENT Cruz allegedly carried out the shooting with an AR-15, an assault-style weapon that he purchased legally roughly a year earlier from a dealer in nearby Coral Springs, Fla. The chorus of students calling for policymakers to address gun violence crescendoed throughout Thursday and Friday. In a Thursday morning interview with CNN, Stoneman Douglas student David Hogg pleaded directly to lawmakers, calling the rash of mass shootings in American schools ""unacceptable."" ""You need to take some action and play a role,"" Hogg said. ""Work together, come over your politics and get something done."" At a Thursday night vigil for the victims of the Stoneman Douglas shooting, chants of ""no more guns"" broke out among the crowd. On Friday, Cameron Kasky, a 17-year-old junior at the high school, penned an op-ed for CNN, in which he declared that politicians had ""abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools."" “But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account,"" he wrote. ""This time we are going to pressure them to take action."" And as Trump prepared to travel on Florida on Friday to meet with first responders and families of victims, dozens of students gathered at a nearby high school to protest the president's gun policies and the influence of the NRA. The protests show no signs of fading. The organizers behind the Women's March have called for a national school walkout next month to protest what they say is Congress's tacit response to mass shootings. The walkout on March 14 is set to last 17 minutes, and will seek to pressure lawmakers ""to do more than tweet thoughts and prayers in response to the gun violence plaguing our schools and neighborhoods,"" the group said on its website. A separate walkout is also being organized to take place on April 20. CNN is also set to hold a televised town hall event on Wednesday with Stoneman Douglas students and parents. The network has invited a number of policymakers to attend the discussion, including President Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Rep. Ted Deutch Theodore (Ted) Eliot DeutchThe Hill's Coronavirus Report: Teachers' union President Randi Weingarten calls Trump administration plan to reopen schools 'a train wreck'; US surpasses 3 million COVID-19 cases US lawmakers call on EU to label entire Hezbollah a terrorist organization 189 House Democrats urge Israel to 'reconsider' annexation MORE (D-Fla.) and Sens.

""Children are dead because of you,"" he said. Democrats have frequently called for gun control laws in response to mass shootings, but it remains to be seen whether enough support can be rallied to enact new legislation — especially in a Republican-controlled Congress. In early October, nearly 60 people died in Las Vegas when a gunman opened fire on a nearby country music festival from his hotel room. In the aftermath, lawmakers discussed banning bump stocks, which allow a semi-automatic rifle to imitate an automatic weapon. After the attack, support for gun control laws also reached an all-time high, with an October Quinnipiac University poll showing 60 percent of Americans in favor of tightening gun laws. Republicans, however, have so far shown little appetite for new gun restrictions. In a radio interview on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanThe Memo: Trump's grip on GOP loosens as polls sink Ryan warned Trump was losing key voters in Wisconsin, other states: NYT Bush, Romney won't support Trump reelection: NYT MORE (R-Wis.) warned against jumping to conclusions after the shooting, and said that it was not the time to talk about gun control. ""There’s more questions than answers at this stage,"" Ryan told Indiana radio host Tony Katz. ""I don’t think that means you then roll the conversation into taking away citizens’ rights — taking away a law-abiding citizens' rights."" Rubio also warned against jumping to conclusions, saying Wednesday that it was ""important to know"" the facts of the shooting before delving into the issue of gun-control legislation. ""I think it's important to know all of that before you jump to conclusions that there was some law that we could have passed that would have prevented it,"" he said in an interview on Fox News. ""And there may be, but shouldn't we at least know the facts?"" Many Republicans have also sought to turn attention to mental illness following the shooting. A day after the attack, Trump himself suggested that Cruz was ""mentally disturbed,"" and that it is up to classmates and community members to flag concerns to law enforcement. Attention has also turned to concerns about how the shooting was able to take place, after the FBI acknowledged on Friday that it failed to investigate a tip it received in January warning of Cruz's erratic behavior, gun ownership and desire to kill. The FBI conceded that the tip from a person close to Cruz ""should have been assessed as a potential threat to life."" Instead, the bureau failed to investigate the claim and never passed the information on to its Miami field office.

""The officer said we had some suspicion it might be drugs, does he have a drug history?"" Yeagley said. ""The mother said she too is concerned this could be drugs."" Officers took Davis to the hospital, where he was treated and later released into the custody of his parents on Friday. Hours later, Davis' parents James Eric Davis, 48, and Diva Jeneen Davis, 47 were shot and killed. Yeagley said Davis was captured on video Friday entering the dorm hall with a weapon that police believe to have been registered to his father, who was a police officer. The university said that police determined Davis went to the family vehicle, got the gun and returned to the residence hall with the handgun.

48,48,100083,https://www.yahoo.com/news/suspect-fatal-kroger-shooting-first-132909900.html,Suspect In Fatal Kroger Shooting First Tried To Get Inside Black Church: Police,"After releasing a photo of the suspect, authorities received a tip from an employee of the city of Jeffersontown who said he thought he saw Gregory Bush outside the First Baptist church prior to Wednesday’s shooting, city police chief Sam Rogers said. The video confirmed Bush’s presence, Rogers said. The church is headed by a black pastor and has a large African-American membership. Bush “appeared to try to gain access to the church,” Rogers said. The information came as news media outlets reported that Bush made a racial comment after the deadly shooting at a Kroger in Jeffersontown, a city of about 26,600 people on the outskirts of Louisville. Rogers said it was too soon, however, to say whether the shooting was racially motivated. “I can’t speculate on motive at this time,” the chief said at a news conference Thursday. “We are pursuing all avenues of the investigation no matter where that takes us or what it involves.” The FBI announced that it “is evaluating the evidence to determine if there were any violations of federal law.” Hate crimes are prosecuted under federal law. Rogers also said Bush apparently does have a history of mental illness, as news outlets have reported. Gregory Alan Bush is pictured in a photo provided by the Louisville Metro Department of Corrections. More An arrest report says Bush walked into the Kroger, pulled a gun from his waist and shot a man in the back of the head, then kept shooting him multiple times “as he was down on the floor.” The report says Bush then reholstered his gun, walked outside and killed a woman in the parking lot. Each victim died of multiple gunshot wounds, Rogers said. A man carrying a concealed weapon who happened to be in the parking lot challenged Bush, and police say the suspect then “began firing wildly” at him, putting other shoppers in the parking lot in danger. Neither man was hurt in that confrontation, Rogers said. Bystander video shows a white man in a distinctive neon-yellow shirt trying to drive away while an officer chases after him on foot. Many more officers converged on the scene and made the arrest just a few hundred yards (meters) from the store on Wednesday afternoon. Bush was jailed on $5 million bond Thursday on two counts of murder and 10 counts of felony wanton endangerment. Ed Harrell was quoted by the Courier Journal of Louisville as saying he was waiting on his wife in the parking lot when he heard gunshots and grabbed his revolver. As he crouched down, he said he saw the gunman walk “nonchalantly” by with a gun by his side. Harrell said he called out to ask what was going on, and the gunman replied: “Don’t shoot me. I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites.” Rogers said police “are aware of that statement and are evaluating any factors that may come into play with” it. He said he had “no direct knowledge” of whether there was more than one armed bystander at the scene. The local coroner’s office identified the victims as Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vicki Lee Jones, 67. Police said there didn’t appear to be any connection between Bush and the victims, or any link between Bush and the Kroger store. Stallard’s 12-year-old grandson was shopping with him in the store when he was gunned down, Jeffersontown Mayor Bill Dieruf said Thursday. The boy was physically unharmed, but most certainly traumatized, the mayor said, adding, “He was there and cannot unsee what he has seen.” Stallard was the father of Kellie Watson, the chief racial equity officer for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. The mayor shared his outrage Thursday over what he called an “epidemic of gun violence” that “hit close to home.” “People getting shot at a grocery store, a school, outside a church. Can’t we all agree that that is unacceptable?” said Fischer, a Democrat running for re-election. Authorities removed computers and cellphones from the house where Bush lived with his parents. Bush’s criminal record shows he threatened his ex-wife and punched a deputy sheriff during a family court hearing years ago. He also was charged with assaulting his elderly parents in January 2009. An arrest citation said Bush’s parents were punched and choked, and they told police they were “terrified of (his) unpredictable behavior.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost.",Jeffersontown Kroger shooting Jeffersontown Louisville Suspect  Kroger Murder  Hate crime Criminal charge,"A still image from a video of the suspect, Gregory Bush, in a police photo released by the Louisville Police Department.","After releasing a photo of the suspect, authorities received a tip from an employee of the city of Jeffersontown who said he thought he saw Gregory Bush outside the First Baptist church prior to Wednesday’s shooting, city police chief Sam Rogers said.

(Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photos: Getty Images (2); background from top left: Nam Y. Huh/AP, MediaPunch/IPX/AP, Alex Brandon/AP, Joe Skipper/AP, MediaPunch/IPX/AP, Nam Y. Huh/AP, Hoo-me.com / MediaPunch/AP (2), Manuel Valdes/AP) Survivors of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., joined the chorus of Americans denouncing the National Rifle Association’s (NRA) influence on elected officials over the gun control issue. But will this moment lead to substantive change in the nation’s gun laws, or will it be subsumed into Washington’s larger gridlock — forgotten until the next school shooting, as has happened repeatedly in the past? There may be a clue in the history of the regulation of another dangerous product, cigarettes. Gun-control groups say the firearms industry is using some of the same tactics the tobacco lobby used to forestall regulations for most of the 20th century, including the suppression of potentially damaging research and casting the issue in terms of “rights” and “freedom.” But the record shows that over the course of several decades, and over the well-funded opposition of a powerful industry, public-health advocates (mostly) prevailed in the battle against smoking. “The tobacco industry is built on profiting from a product that kills and causes disease for hundreds of thousands of Americans. Unfortunately, the same is true for the gun industry. While there are legitimate uses for firearms — for example in the military — for the most part firearms, particularly assault weapons, are marketed to civilians in a way which increases and continues a legacy of death and injury,” Mark Pertschuk, former president of Americans for Nonsmokers’ Rights and former legislative director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, said to Yahoo News. A study published in the American Journal of Medicine in February 2016 found that Americans are 10 times more likely than citizens of other developed countries to be shot and killed. Researchers from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the University of Nevada at Reno analyzed World Health Organization mortality data for 23 high-income nations. Though the U.S. only had half the population of the other 22 nations combined, Americans accounted for 82 percent of all gun deaths. Gun-murder rates are 25 times higher in the U.S. than in similar wealthy nations. The U.S. also accounted for 90 percent of all women, young adults (under 25) and children killed with a gun. Story continues The analogy isn’t only to the tobacco industry. Trade groups have clear missions to support the interests of their industries they represent. But public health advocates take issue when misinformation is knowingly propagated and, from their perspective, profits are privileged over people. For instance, Coca-Cola and other soda companies long promoted the notion that exercise rather than healthful nutrition choices could solve the obesity epidemic. They still challenge soda taxes and other initiatives intended to reduce consumption. Barron Lerner, a professor of medicine and public health at NYU Langone Health, said the tobacco industry’s mission for many years was to obfuscate the data that shows cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. Although the tobacco industry lobbied in Washington, he said, its greatest accomplishment wasn’t buying the cooperation of members of Congress or finding advocates from tobacco-growing states so much as it was complicating the issue — creating enough doubt in the public to delay the implementation of antismoking measures. “There are historical moments where things get so bad, the carnage is so much and the rhetoric is so absurd that there’s finally movement,” Lerner told Yahoo News. “I think we’re ready for some type of a similar movement in the world of guns.” In the mid-20th century, nearly half of all adult Americans smoked cigarettes, which were considered cool and glamorous. Smoking rates have steadily declined — from 42.4 percent of American adults in 1965 to 16.8 percent in 2014 — and many now consider cigarettes disgusting and socially distasteful. What changed? In short, the health hazards became widely known. A major turning point for cigarettes came in January 1964, when the Surgeon General’s Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health released its landmark report, which definitively linked cigarettes and lung cancer — discrediting the tobacco companies’ attempts to cast doubt on the link. The science on cigarette smoking led directly to public health measures to mitigate harm: higher taxes, public service announcements, warning labels on the packages, smoke-free areas, etc. The cigarette companies eventually had to publicly apologize after published correspondence clearly showed that they had lied to and misled the American people. Cliff Douglas, vice president for tobacco control at the American Cancer Society and an attorney, was involved in landmark litigation against the tobacco industry in the ’90s. He said the tobacco industry’s lobbyists and attorneys, with whom he dealt directly, are experts at changing the subject, just like the character Nick Naylor from “Thank You for Smoking.” They would much rather discuss “freedom” and “rights” than cigarettes or guns, he said. “They are masterful at spinning the web and distracting from the key issues, which is that their products are killing people and that the industry actually has the ability to change the whole dynamic. You can make the products safer or not market them the way you do. There are so many decision points for them, but instead they shift the burden to us to defend restricting people’s freedom.” Back in December 1953, Douglas said, the CEOs for the major cigarette companies initiated a half-century long conspiracy to cover up the dangers of smoking. These companies were found guilty of racketeering in federal court in 2006. They created false science, misled the public about the health impact of their products, delayed policy change by influencing the political process and distracted from “the reality of the epidemic of death that their business was responsible for.” “That’s very dramatic sounding but it’s factual,” Douglas said. “What I see is a direct line of comparison between that political and public relations strategy and that of the gun industry.” In the mid-’90s, Douglas was responsible for an exposé on ABC News about the tobacco industry’s manipulation of nicotine levels in cigarettes to get consumers addicted. The story prompted tobacco company Philip Morris to sue for libel. Facing the possibility of $10 billion in damages, ABC News publicly apologized. Fast-forward to today: Thanks to the 2006 ruling, tobacco companies are legally obligated to run prime-time TV ads with corrective messages — such as “cigarette companies intentionally designed cigarettes with enough nicotine to create and sustain addiction” — that effectively corroborate Douglas’s thesis. In the early ‘90s, there was a push for a similar, public health approach to reducing the high rate of gun deaths. Physician Arthur Kellermann published several articles in the New England Journal of Medicine arguing that if a product is killing and injuring Americans, then public health officials should find science-based approaches to reduce the harm. Perhaps waiting periods, gun registration, locking up guns in homes and other steps could reduce deaths, he suggested. His intent was to depoliticize the issue. But, as you might have noticed, guns have not been depoliticized at all. There are several important distinctions between tobacco and guns. Cigarette use was prevalent across virtually all demographics in the U.S. during the industry’s golden years. But gun ownership diverges strongly along rural and urban lines — a divide that’s been exploited in the culture war. “There’s probably a small percentage of people giving away their guns because they’re disgusted. Most people who have guns and use them properly love their guns. That’s another cultural difference,” Lerner said. “That makes it harder to stigmatize guns. Cigarettes became stigmatized. People who didn’t smoke hated them. People who did smoke wished they didn’t.” There’s also the issue of research. Whereas there are reams of government studies about tobacco, lung cancer and heart disease, the Dickey Amendment of 1996, which mandates that no government funding “may be used to advocate or promote gun control,” effectively prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from even studying gun violence. There have been numerous efforts to repeal it and former Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., now regrets introducing the legislation. “There’s less science available to prove what sort of strategies might be effective for gun control” as a result of the law, Lerner said. “That cuts out one of the legs of the stool of a public health approach.” Lerner’s book “One for the Road” recounts the national debate over another public-health menace, drunk driving, pitting those who campaigned for education and legislation against those who thought the problem was overregulated and exaggerated. The book explores the reasons drunk driving deaths remained stubbornly high for decades — the alcohol lobby, backlash against Prohibition, insufficient public transit — and the public’s beliefs about individualism, civil liberties and civic responsibility. In meaningful ways, the drunk driving debates foreshadowed the cigarette and gun issues. “The word ‘freedom’ is often used. People called the car ‘the freedom machine.’ The idea in the United States is that since we celebrate our independence and frontier spirit means you should be allowed to do all these things,” Lerner said. “The word ‘freedom’ with guns is constantly used.” An illustrative headline emblazoned across the NRA’s registration page reads, “It’s not just about guns. It’s about freedom.” The rates of drunk-driving deaths in the ’60s were enormously high because there were no regulations and poorly enforced laws. But in the early ’80s, there was a massive anti-drunk driving movement, led by groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). Armed with data about fatalities, they fought for tougher laws and stigmatized drunk driving. “In the vast majority of cases, when scientists and researchers made a good case for a public health approach to a problem, things really changed. Tobacco, drunk driving, absolutely. There was data. These were respected scientists and to some degree the issues became de-politicized,” Lerner said. The Pew Research Center found that despite sharp divisions over concealed carry and other issues, Republicans and Democrats largely agree on several modest gun safety measures, such as conducting background checks for private gun sales and prohibiting people with mental illness or on no-fly lists from purchasing guns. One problem that has stymied grassroots efforts to effect change at the local level is state preemption of local laws. In the ’80s, the cigarette industry started fighting to establish statewide smoking laws that would supersede local jurisdictions — making it impossible for local governments to pass tougher smoking laws. They were opposed by antismoking activists, who overturned state preemption laws, so that today only 12 states preempt local governments from passing ordinances related to smoking. In stark contrast, nearly all states preempt local governments from passing local gun laws. (Hawaii, California, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts do not preempt local governments. The rest do.) The NRA borrowed this strategy of promoting state preemption of local laws from the cigarette industry back in the ’80s, when grassroots movements for gun control were strong. Yahoo News contacted the NRA to get its perspective on these comparisons. We asked what the organization thinks of the claim that the gun industry — like the cigarette industry before it — has suppressed information about the dangers of its product and prevented necessary measures to protect the public. NRA spokesman Lars Dalseide responded, “I realize it’s a constant misconception and often misreported in the press, but the NRA represents individual gun owners, while the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) represents the gun industry. Our members are people, while their members are the Smith & Wessons, Bass Pro Shops and the average AAA Gun Stores of the world.” The NRA presents itself as a voice for 5 million gun owners. But a report from the Violence Policy Center, called “Blood Money: How the Gun Industry Bankrolls the NRA,” revealed that the NRA received between $14.7 million and $38.9 million from all “corporate partners” between 2005 and 2011. The majority of this money (74 percent) came from the gun industry. Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, told Yahoo News, “Today’s NRA is a gun industry trade association masquerading as a shooting sports foundation. Through direct payments and sponsorship deals, tens of millions of dollars flow to the NRA from its financial patrons in the firearms industry. To argue otherwise is to deny reality.” The NSSF did not respond to requests for comment. Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation and a conservative activist, said guns and cigarettes are a completely different story. He said people conflate these topics to demonize guns because they would like to prohibit guns or pass more regulations. “The difference is the cigarette industry suppressed information that really affected public health because ingestion of the cigarette smoke, tar and nicotine obviously had a public health consequence to people’s bodies. People don’t eat or digest guns. People don’t eat or digest bullets,” Gottlieb told Yahoo News. “Guns don’t cause diseases. Cigarettes cause cancer. That’s a significant difference.” He endorsed the position that cigarettes kill people when they are used properly, whereas guns, when used properly, do not kill anyone. According to Gottlieb, the gun industry — unlike the cigarette industry — has gone out of its way to explain safety and how particular guns function. “Yes, there are innocent people who are murdered by guns. But there are also lots of innocent people who are alive today because they had a gun to defend themselves,” Gottlieb said. “They want to ignore that side of the equation.” The Tobacco Atlas, recently published by the American Cancer Society and Vital Strategies, found that the tobacco industry is increasingly targeting emerging markets in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, where regulations aren’t as strong. “At a broad strokes level, what both industries do is prey on vulnerability and ignorance,” Douglas said. “They manipulate the information environment to steer those who know less to actually believe in falsehoods. In other words, they traffic in fake news, and people buy it.” Read more from Yahoo News:",Cigarette Lobbying  National Rifle Association Tobacco Tobacco politics  Photograph News Debate,A gun show in New York City.,"What can we learn about the current debate over guns from earlier public health crises?

An estimated 200,000 people marched in favor of tighter gun restrictions in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, as part of a national and international movement prompted by the massacre at MSD. The movement was organized by victims who survived the mass killing. On Sunday, Kashuv told CBS’ ""Face The Nation"" that he wants to see sensible solutions to prevent school violence. But he also firmly believes the Second Amendment must be protected. ""There's a silent minority at Stoneman Douglas who agrees with me completely,"" he said. Does he believe his voice is being heard? Kashuv said student voices like his are being shut out of the conversation. “And what I saw at the march yesterday which really frustrated me is that I have a different point of view, but what really concerned me was that how come I wasn't invited to speak at the march because as Americans we all have different point of views. And it's important to represent them all equally,"" he said. A ban on ""assault weapons"" and high capacity magazines will not solve the issue, Kashuv said. Instead, he blames the mass killing on law enforcement's failures to enforce already existing laws and practices. “And I find it ironic that after all this and we've seen so many different government failures, we want to trust the government even more,” Kashuv said. Are more guards the answer? A possible solution is more armed guards in schools, he said. The Marshal Program in Florida, for example, allows properly trained officers, veterans and unemployed veterans get training in protecting schools, Kashuv said. Asked if he’d like to see more armed guards at his school, Kashuv said: Absolutely. I mean we saw it Maryland. He stopped the shooter. He did his job and had the cowards of Broward done their job, I think that the count in Parkland would have been much lower. We saw that in Maryland that a good guy with a gun stopped the bad guy with the gun. The only way to stop an active shooter on campus is to have another person to eliminate him. Kashuv said he he is concerned that lawmakers could enact laws that will hurt the American public at large. “We have to make sure that the laws that we're enacting don't hurt America on a national scale,"" he said. “And that's why I think that we have to sit down with all members of this issue.

1120,1120,375,https://slate.com/technology/2018/08/how-the-madden-subreddit-covered-the-jacksonville-shooting.html,How the Madden subreddit covered the Jacksonville shooting.,"This post is part of Reading Reddit, a Slate pop-up blog about Reddit. On Sunday afternoon, as news broke that a video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, had been disrupted by gunfire, a user on the r/Madden community on Reddit posted a link to the story. “Shooting at Madden Tournament in Jacksonville,” user rdmrdm1 wrote, along with a link to audio of the attack. In a series of addenda to the initial post, rdmrdm1 presented new information and links, culminating in a boldfaced plea to his fellow Redditors: “Unless you have a legitimate link, don’t post anything related to the subject. If you turn out to be wrong it may well ruin that person’s life.” In the hours that followed, the world learned that the shooter was David “Bread” Katz, a Maryland man and competitive gamer who had participated in the tournament, been eliminated, and returned with murderous intent. Katz, acting alone, killed two fellow gamers and wounded others before shooting himself. The Jacksonville shooting had been inadvertently, horribly live-streamed, which meant that there was more information initially available to the public than is typical in mass-shooting situations. Still, in the immediate wake of the attack, questions persisted about the number of shooters, the number of victims, the identities of the victims and the shooter, and the shooter’s motive. There was good reason—particularly for any responsible Reddit moderator—to be cautious with the details. When an information void exists with respect to a recent news event, you can always count on Reddit to fill that void with shock, sorrow, speculation, and very stupid commentary. “I hope the city realizes this seriously fucks up their planning for tourism. Why revitalize the urban core if people are scared of having their lives taken,” wrote one poster on the main shooting thread of the r/Jacksonville subreddit. On r/greatawakening, a subreddit for enthusiasts of the QAnon conspiracy theory, users pondered whether the shooting was a deep state ploy meant to deflect attention away from the death of Sen. John McCain, who was a longtime QAnon obsession. (Not all posters subscribed to this line of reasoning. “This has nothing to do with DS or McCain or Q. Not everything that happens is because of Q drops, geez,” wrote one exasperated QAnoner.) When an information void exists with respect to a recent news event, you can always count on Reddit to fill that void with shock, sorrow, speculation, and very stupid commentary. But certain subreddits filled that information void responsibly. I spent a lot of time Sunday afternoon and evening on r/Madden, a subreddit for fans of the Madden NFL video game franchise. The Madden subreddit had news of the shooting almost as soon as it happened, and I was struck by the care with which the initial poster and others tried to correct possible misinformation, dissuade speculation, and encourage users to wait until information had been confirmed by law enforcement or respectable news sources before reporting anything as fact. The subreddit did everything you’d want a mainstream news outlet to do in a breaking-news situation: Stick to the facts, minimize irrelevant commentary, and try very hard to “not make jokes about this.” CNN would be proud. Speculation always abounds in breaking-news scenarios, and the Madden subreddit was no different on Sunday. But the Madden posters were very conscientious about limiting the parameters of the discussion while still allowing room for discussion. When users argued over whether a red dot that appeared on one victim’s chest prior to the shooting—as seen on the Twitch livestream—was a laser gunsight or simply ambient lighting from the venue, others jumped in to slow things down. “Please don’t mislead people by representing speculation as facts,” wrote one user in response to another’s insistence that victim Eli “Trueboy” Clayton had been targeted by a laser sight. When some users speculated on whether a loud, live-streamed argument during the previous day of the tournament had precipitated the attack, others chimed in with words of caution. “Before reddit detectives get carried away, remember what happened after the Boston marathon case. Best just leave these things to the authorities,” wrote another user. As of Monday afternoon, the thread is riddled with since-deleted comments that presumably engaged in speculation as to the identity and or motive of the shooter; all that remains of these threads is rdmrdm1 urging his fellow posters to stick to the facts. Reddit wasn’t always this cautious. In April 2013, in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, a group of Reddit users came together to play Sherlock Holmes. In a subreddit called r/findbostonbombers—the subreddit is now a private community—Redditors pored over publicly available images, pooled their speculative efforts, and exulted in the notion that they might solve the case that had thus far stumped the FBI. They didn’t. Instead, the amateur detectives there spent a frenzied several days fixating on people who turned out to be innocent bystanders, such as “Blue Robe Guy,” who seemed like he was “trying to look nonchalant,” and two men who where holding striped backpacks. One photo parsed on FindBostonBombers even ended up on the front page of the New York Post under the erroneous headline “BAG MEN: Feds seek these two pictured at Boston Marathon.” The two men in the photo turned out to be a local high school runner and a track coach. The case reached its nadir when Redditors mistook a photo released by law enforcement of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev for one of Sunil Tripathi, a Brown University student who had gone missing that March. This misbegotten theory took on new life when Twitter users erroneously reported that Tripathi’s name had been mentioned on the Boston Police Department scanner as a suspect in the case. It hadn’t, and he wasn’t, but that didn’t stop FindBostonBombers—and the many, many reporters who had been following the subreddit all week—from crowing over their investigative prowess, amplifying the false report, and bringing great pain to Tripathi’s worried family. Tripathi’s body was found in a river near Providence, Rhode Island, several days later; his death was later deemed a suicide. By that time, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev had been arrested, and the hapless efforts of the Reddit mystery team had become an embarrassing subplot in an American tragedy. “Overall, it was a disaster,” the subreddit’s anonymous creator later told the Atlantic later. “It was doomed from the start when you look at it in hindsight, because not one of the images that were available on the Internet actually had the bombers in it. I also fully admit that I was naive to think that everyone would listen to the rules and keep the posts within the subreddit.” A project that began as a giddy adventure had ended up irresponsibly smearing innocent people and had helped impede the flow of factual information in a time of national crisis. Five years later, the shadow of the Boston Marathon debacle loomed over r/Madden’s efforts to parse the shooting. Immediately below rdmrdm1’s initial post, one of the Madden subreddit’s moderators chimed in, exhorting posters to maintain civility and not politicize the tragedy. The moderator also reiterated rdmrdm1’s initial message: “Please also refrain from posting rumours about who was responsible etc. until we have something definitive from a reputable news source. Let’s avoid a Boston Marathon fiasco.” Variations on that same refrain abounded in the subreddit on Sunday. I think we can call this a sign of growth. The caution shown by the Madden posters on Sunday is a tacit recognition that, for many people, subreddits can function as news sources, and that it is therefore incumbent on them to be as factual as possible when news breaks. “The junior detective shit is really annoying,” wrote user Matt24BB. “Let the authorities sort it out, the info will eventually come out.” A motto to live by.",Jacksonville Landing Jacksonville Landing shooting  News Image Video Games Getty Images Photograph  Photography,"The F.B.I. building in Jacksonville, Fla., where the shooting took place on Sunday.","This post is part of Reading Reddit, a Slate pop-up blog about Reddit.

708,708,10862,http://us.cnn.com/2018/03/27/politics/repealing-the-second-amendment/index.html,There's not a 'snowflake's chance in hell' of repealing the Second Amendment,"(CNN) How could those high school kids have marched en masse and not achieved any meaningful reform? That seems to be the state of affairs: The gun laws seem intractably set, despite growing public support to change them, at least on the periphery of the laws. Measures passed in Florida after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting seem to have no prospects at the national level. But former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is not talking about frittering around the edges of anything. He issued a modest proposal in The New York Times to get rid of the Second Amendment altogether. Repeal it, he says Stevens argued that a right to bear arms, which the Supreme Court has said the Second Amendment guarantees, should mean something different in the era of today's weapons and today's civil society, and, in the spirit of many gun-control advocates, pointed out the Second Amendment is talking about militias when it brings up ""arms."" The entire text of the Second Amendment, remember, is this: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Stevens has railed in the past about how far we've gotten from the idea of militias in the interpretation of the Second Amendment -- and he channels that view in the op-ed. ""Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed,'"" he writes in the Times. ""Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century."" He then launches into a Supreme Court history lesson on how gun laws evolved from 1789 to a unanimous decision against sawed-off shotguns in 1939 because they weren't appropriate for use in a ""well-regulated militia"" -- through the landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller that threw the whole idea of a well-regulated militia out the window. That case changed the interpretation of the Second Amendment's clause concerning guns to be an individual right for self-defense. Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in the case, by the way, is a marvel of grammatical gymntastics , that decides the amendment is not about the well-regulated militia discussed in the text, but rather that ""it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home."" Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford, but he often sided with the more liberal wing of the court during his tenure and he resigned during the Obama administration, resulting in Elena Kagan being confirmed to take his spot on the bench. So he's bringing a more liberal mindset to this issue. It's also unlikely to happen. Probably ever. Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and Second Amendment expert who supports gun control, was tweeting Tuesday about Stevens' piece, and said, ""there's not a snowflake's chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment any time soon."" Of course all this overlooks the obvious problem: There's not a snowflakes chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment anytime soon. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 ""We can't even get Congress to pass a law banning bump stocks,"" Winkler wrote. ""We can't get Congress to mandate universal background checks. And Stevens thinks 2/3s of Congress will vote to repeal the 2A? And 3/4 of the states will ratify such an amendment? Nonsense."" But it's still worth examining whether repealing the Second Amendment is actually that what people want. There is, indeed, great support for tighter gun laws -- seven in 10 Americans said in a CNN poll after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting that they'd support new gun restrictions. That's the highest such support in 25 years. But on more specific proposals that could be seen as limiting gun rights, there were very partisan divides. A ban on semi-automatic weapons, for instance, had the support of 80% of Democrats and 53% of independents, but just 34% of Republicans, for instance. The idea of limiting the number of guns an individual can own garners 69% support among Democrats vs. just 23% among Republicans, according to that CNN poll. It's hard to find any recent reliable polling on the larger idea of repealing the amendment completely, but if there are sharp divides on specific efforts to curb gun rights, it's a good bet that an entire repeal would be even more controversial. A minority of American households have guns -- 30%, according to a Pew survey in 2017, with 16% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans owning guns. It's important here to say that Stevens did not say in his op-ed that guns should be taken away from anyone who has them, just that the Second Amendment should be repealed. What would be left to regulate the many millions of guns already in the country? That would have to be figured out. But you can hear the slogan opponents would use against an effort like Stevens' proposal: They're trying to take your guns away! In fact, that's a slogan President Donald Trump used effectively against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016 (and since then), accusing her of wanting to ""take your guns away"" even though Clinton said she was a supporter of Second Amendment rights. JUST WATCHED Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' 01:13 Winkler also argued that Stevens' proposal is counterproductive because it backs up the claim by Trump and the NRA that supporters of gun control want to take away guns. ""Stevens's call to repeal the 2A is not only ineffective but worse: it makes it even harder to pass good gun laws today. It plays right into the hands of the @nra which can now point to this op-ed and say, 'See, we told you they want to take away your rights and your guns.'"" Current Democratic leaders, even as they have pushed for new gun control, have made clear they support the Second Amendment. If national elections are going to be won and lost in the Rust Belt, Democrats will need support from gun rights supporters if they're going to win congressional or presidential elections. ""I believe in the Second Amendment, there's a right to bear arms,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in February. ""Every law-abiding citizen has the right to have a gun unless you're a felon, or you're adjudicated mentally ill, everyone agrees to that."" Even if Democrats turned wholesale against the Second Amendment (and gave up any claim they had on moderates and gun lovers in their party), there's the not-so-small difficulty of actually changing the Constitution. The Constitution has been amended 27 times in US history, including the original 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. The last amendment ratified was the 27th in 1992, which made it so Congress can't raise its own wages until the following Congress. That took decades to pass. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and CNN contributor, said it's not impossible to repeal the Second Amendment, but perhaps Stevens was trying to reframe the arguments. ""I wonder if Justice Stevens was trying to take a step back from the politics of the moment to situate the debate in a broader context,"" he said, although he pointed out that changes to the Constitution have been few and far between. ""There have only been 17 amendments in 231 years, and most of those have been about the structure of government/elections/voting, not substantive rights. It's really quite difficult to get an amendment through, especially on a divisive question of social policy,"" Vladeck said. None of the original 10 amendments has ever been repealed or changed, so you're well into uncharted territory with Stevens' idea. The only amendment which really took something away from citizens was the 18th Amendment, which was enacted in 1920 and made alcohol illegal on the national level. And maybe the precedent for what Stevens proposes is the 21st Amendment, by which the 18th Amendment was repealed 13 years later. It takes an amendment to repeal an amendment. Article V of the Constitution lays out that process, which requires supermajorities in Congress and of state legislatures and/or constitutional conventions. So politically and procedurally, Stevens' idea is a conversation-starter (and maybe a much-needed conversation-starter), but not much else. Repealing the Second Amendment isn't likely to happen any time soon. To say the least. But Stevens doesn't seem to be worried about those details. He's making a broader point about the court and guns. Later in his piece, Stevens suggests the entire aim of getting rid of the Second Amendment would be to overturn that decision in Heller, which made gun ownership an individual right. ""Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option,"" he writes. I agree! We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the 2A, gun control proponents need to mobilize politically. That seems to be happening now. https://t.co/IS1cYJuWwT — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 Winkler said marchers and other activists should stay the course they are on. ""We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the (Second Amendment), gun control proponents need to mobilize politically,"" he wrote. Vladeck argued there is plenty of gun control legislation that can be achieved under the current structure and he pointed to a Maryland assault weapons case as proof. ""So we may not need either a different Supreme Court or a constitutional amendment to achieve most of what reformers are seeking; we just need folks to realize that the principal objections to many of these proposals are political, not constitutional,"" Vladeck said.","Gun Remington Arms Remington Outdoor Company Inc.

Kevin Williams. Williams was introduced by his boss, Kane County Sheriff Donald Kramer, who said that in today’s world 'you need to figure out how to protect yourself better.' 'Unfortunately we live in a world where this can happen anywhere, at any time,' Kramer said. 'I myself was involved in an incident where a man had a gun outside a restaurant. Fortunately, they had protocols in place and had people duck down in their booths and they locked the front door so no one could get in or out.' Keys to surviving an attack range from having the 'survival mindset,' Williams said, to 'being aware of your baseline, having situational awareness and the desire to fight, distract or flee from the shooter.' 'When people enter a building, they need to know where the entrances and exits are and how to get out as well as be aware of the people around them and how they look,' he said. 'You need to know your own baseline and bias and when something doesn’t look or feel right, you need to leave.' Workers saying hello to one another in the morning and sitting at their desks would be a baseline for many people, Williams said. 'Whereas somebody screaming in the office wouldn’t be,' he said. Williams said 'trying to talk the shooter into putting his weapon away' is one of the worst things a potential victim can do. He said options include distracting the shooter as well as 'hiding, barricading or running.' 'The best option is to get out, but if you’re in a restaurant and someone is standing at the door, you can distract them in whatever way you can whether it’s throwing your Coke at them or a glass,' he said. 'In an unlocked room, you have to barricade the door with whatever you have. The shooter knows the police are coming and won’t have time to waste trying to get a door open. 'The message here is that you can hide, fight or run but having someone like me talk about dealing with a situation like this does no good if you don’t practice it, just like kids practicing for fire drills every year,' he said. About two dozen residents came out to the meeting Wednesday night including Judy Smith, 78, of Aurora, who said she was hoping 'to get some ideas about what to do when you’re out on the walking trails.' 'I go by myself for walks at all times of day and even at night,' Smith said. '… I carry pepper spray with me when I go.'

Andrew Cuomo (D) could make it “unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission.” In the July 20 amended complaint, first reported by the New York Law Journal’s Dan M. Clark and embedded at the bottom of this article, the NRA accuses Cuomo, as well as New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) Superintendent Maria Vullo, of issuing a “series of threats to financial institutions that DFS … will exercise its extensive regulatory power against those entities that fail to sever ties with the NRA.” The threats amount to a series of warnings and regulatory actions by the New York state government targeting insurance companies and other financial entities doing business with the NRA, warning that working with the group would put financial businesses in legal jeopardy or damage their public reputation. While it’s in the NRA’s interest to exaggerate the danger Cuomo and his allies’ actions pose to the group (so as to strengthen the lawsuit’s case), the complaint argues that Cuomo’s actions could wind up threatening the NRA’s continued existence. These threats, the complaint goes on to argue, endanger the financial viability of the organization by putting its access to financial services at risk. Cuomo could, the complaint states, “imminently deprive the NRA of basic bank-depository services, corporate insurance coverage, and other financial services essential to the NRA’s corporate existence and its advocacy mission.” To pay its employees, buy mailing materials, have a website, accept donations and membership dues, etc., the group needs basic checking account services. To keep holding its annual meeting and other rallies, it needs event insurance coverage. And in particular, it needs media liability coverage to run NRATV and other media projects. Without it, “it is likely that NRATV would be forced to cease operating,” the complaint states. The complaint further argues that the organization is having real difficulties securing this coverage. In January, it states, the NRA began negotiations with “a major DFS-regulated insurance carrier” (which it only refers to as the “Corporate Carrier”) to renew its general liability, umbrella, and media liability insurance policies. In February, the insurance company Lockton, which is not the corporate carrier in the suit but which collaborated with the NRA on its “Carry Guard” line of insurance products, publicly announced it would stop working with the NRA. The corporate carrier then, the complaint says, “abruptly reversed its position” and said it was “unwilling to renew coverage at any price” (emphasis in original). “The NRA has encountered serious difficulties obtaining corporate insurance coverage to replace coverage withdrawn by the Corporate Carrier,” the complaint says. “Nearly every carrier has indicated that it fears transacting with the NRA specifically in light of DFS’s actions.” Multiple banks, it continues, have also withdrawn bids to do basic depository services for the NRA. The origins of the Cuomo v. NRA battle The lawsuit dates the New York state government’s efforts against the NRA to September 2017, and blames it on pressure from Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control group financially backed by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. In October 2017, the lawsuit notes, New York’s Department of Financial Services began investigating the “Carry Guard” line of insurance products, a firearms training program from the NRA that also offers insurance “to cover legal fees and liabilities arising from self-defense shootings.” But “the scope of the DFS investigation expanded rapidly” and by late 2017 and early 2018, the NRA says, the DFS was pressuring banks and insurers to stop working with the NRA. As the Trace’s Alex Yablon explains, the dispute became very public in April when Cuomo called on the Department of Financial Services to “urge insurance companies … to review any relationships they may have with the National Rifle Association and other similar organizations” and to “consider whether such ties harm their corporate reputations and jeopardize public safety.” In May, DFS reached settlements including more than $8 million in fines against Chubb and Lockton Affinity, two insurance companies that supported Carry Guard. In a press release on the Lockton case, DFS Superintendent Vullo said that the Carry Guard program “unlawfully provided liability insurance to gun owners for certain acts of intentional wrongdoing, and improperly provided insurance coverage for criminal defense.” As part of the settlements, Lockton and Chubb both agreed to refrain from participating in Carry Guard or selling similar products to New York residents. Cuomo has been a vocal gun control advocate for years, and it’s not exactly surprising that he would choose to target the NRA. From his perspective, DFS is taking perfectly legitimate, legal actions against the group after the NRA and its commercial partners violated state laws regulating insurance and the marketing of insurance. From the NRA’s perspective, Cuomo is creating a “de facto censorship scheme” meant to chill pro-gun rights speech and the NRA’s right to free association. What does this mean for the NRA’s future? The complaint depicts an organization in mortal peril, whose lack of access to basic financial instruments could threaten its very existence. But the NRA is a mass-membership organization with powerful supporters in the federal government and the business community. A skeptical reader might argue that the NRA is trying to portray itself as more threatened than it really is in order to strengthen its case against Cuomo and enable it to resume offering its Carry Guard line of insurance products. That said, the reputational pressure the group is facing, in light of the Parkland school shooting and renewed gun control advocacy by students and others, is very real. An anonymous source at Ackerman McQueen, an advertising/PR firm that has worked closely with the NRA, gave Yablon at the Trace a candid explanation. The source said, as Yablon put it, that the NRA was “counting on Carry Guard to provide revenue after Donald Trump’s 2016 election win.” Democratic presidents are incredibly good for NRA membership and gun sales generally, because they create fear of new gun control laws. Republican presidents make gun activists more complacent, which can make the NRA strapped. Notably, the NRA is asking for Cuomo and Vallo to pay for damages caused by “lost prospective business relations.” That is, if Carry Guard can’t get them money, they want to get it by suing.",Dana Loesch National Rifle Association 2018 NRA boycott Image Speech Dark money Spokesperson Republican Party News,The National Rifle Association is suing New York for a lawsuit against the National Rifle Association.,"The National Rifle Association (NRA), the premier pro-gun lobby in the United States and arguably one of the country’s most powerful interest groups on any policy topic, says that efforts to fight it by New York Gov.

HOUSTON, TX -- With a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue still fresh in America’s memory, some of the nation's leading gun control advocates took their campaigns this weekend to Texas, a deep-red state with more registered guns than any U.S. state, according to a 2016 report by the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""We must do something — we must stop gun violence,"" Gabby Giffords — the former Arizona congresswoman who survived a gunshot to the head during a mass shooting in 2011, said during back-to-back campaign events on Saturday for Democratic candidate Lizzie Pannill Fletcher in Texas' 7th Congressional District. ""Do you have the courage to fight? Stand with me. Vote, vote, vote!"" she said. Giffords, who suffers from aphasia — a condition that impedes her communication skills due to damage from being shot on the left side of her brain — let her husband, former NASA astronaut Mark Kelly, do much of the talking on the campaign trail.

AP ""The answer is not more guns, and this is coming from a gun owner,"" Kelly said during a Texas town hall forum that concluded the couple's nationwide ""Vote Save Lives"" tour. ""Logically, that doesn't make sense,"" Kelly told ABC News.

It does not pass the logic test."" Sen. Ted Cruz debates Rep. Beto O'Rourke in a televised debate on Oct. 16, 2018 in San Antonio. Tom Reel/Pool via Getty Images Kelly touched on the aftermath of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting that claimed the lives of 11 victims, and on the president's response to the massacre. ""Arming the security guard wouldn't have stopped anything,"" Kelly said. Giffords and Kelly were joined by some of the most outspoken gun reform activists from Parkland, Fla., and Santa Fe High School in Galveston County, TX, Friday at the University of Houston to encourage other young people to cast votes in Texas' upcoming midterms. ""November 6 is not the deadline,"" said David Hogg, a survivor of the mass shooting in Parkland in February that killed 17 students and staffers. ""It's the start of a revolution. ""I'm ready to see this country be what it says it is on paper,"" Hogg added. Megan Mcguire, a 17-year-old high school senior who survived a mass shooting at Sante Fe High School in May that left 10 dead, assailed Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz, but praised his Democratic opponent Beto O'Rourke. ""Ted Cruz, we have tried to contact him through email, through phone call — we have tried to set meetings and he refused to meet with us,"" she said. Mcguire told the crowd she was too young to vote, but encouraged them to vote on her behalf. ""Beto sat down with a note pad and pen and paper and asked how we felt,"" Mcguire said of O'Rourke. ""He promised us he would change how things are happening. That was really important to me."" In the closely watched Senate race, O'Rourke and Cruz share different views on gun reform. During his campaign trail, O'Rourke has not shied away from expressing his sentiments on gun control in a state where recent mass shootings have energized the issue on the campaign trail. ""Thoughts and prayers, Senator Cruz, are just not going to cut it anymore. The people of Texas, the children of Texas deserve action,"" O'Rourke said during he and Cruz's first debate in September. Cruz, who backed President Trump's suggestions of arming teachers and adding more armed police officers in schools, has targeted O'Rourke and his polices on gun control, attempting to garner support from Texans who wish for their current gun laws to remain the same. Cruz released a campaign ad saying the democrat ""wants to take our guns."" Fletcher, who shares similar values on gun reform as O'Rourke, said she's optimistic she'll help transition the current gun legislation Texas and the country needs no matter which aisle of the spectrum representatives are on. ""We need to make sure we've got members of Congress who are willing to work across the aisle and understand there is no monopoly on good ideas, but that we all need to actually do the work of governing,"" Fletcher told ABC News.

896,896,90446,http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-mass-shooting-bills-california-20180905-story.html,"Stunned by a surge in mass shootings, California lawmakers send nine gun-control bills to the governor","Nearly 30 years after California became the first state to ban the sale of assault weapons and embarked on a path toward the strictest firearm laws in the nation, legislators have sent Gov. Jerry Brown nine new gun-control bills in response to a surge in mass shootings. The action by the Legislature was applauded more than 3,000 miles away in Parkland, Fla., where a 19-year-old gunman killed 17 students and employees at a high school in February. Among the legislation waiting approval by Brown are proposals to lift the age for buying rifles and shotguns from 18 to 21, and to prohibit the purchase of more than one long gun a month. “If we had these bills in place in Florida, then I would not have had to go through this tragedy and lose some of my friends,” said Sari Kaufman, 16, a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who is now an activist with Students Demand Action, a part of the national group Everytown for Gun Safety. “I’m proud to see California pass this kind of legislation, and I hope to see other states follow suit,” she said. Advertisement Legislators also approved bills that would create lifetime bans on gun ownership for those convicted of domestic violence or who are involuntarily hospitalized for mental illness twice in a year; make it tougher to be licensed to carry a concealed firearm; and strengthen a law prohibiting multi-burst trigger devices called bump stocks, used in 2017 by a gunman in Las Vegas who killed 58 people and injured hundreds more. Lawmakers also approved a bill that would allow teachers and employers to petition the courts to have guns confiscated from people who are a danger to themselves and others. Assemblyman Phil Ting (D-San Francisco) said lessons learned after the Parkland shooting helped him draft that bill. Coverage of California politics » Advertisement “Prior to February’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, teachers and administrators expressed increasing concern about the gunman’s behavior at school,” Ting said. “We need to give California schools more tools to prevent another campus tragedy.” Republican lawmakers advocating for gun owners said the proposed laws were an overreaction to isolated incidents that will not reduce gun violence, and will infringe on constitutional rights. State Sen. Jim Nielsen (R-Gerber) said during one floor debate that the majority party was engaging in a larger campaign to “disarm the law-abiding.” He was particularly opposed to Ting’s bill. Nielsen said the proposal raises the possibility that people will seek restraining orders based on bias or “irrational fear” of a co-worker. ”I view this as another attack on our 2nd Amendment rights,” he said. Advertisement Sen. Joel Anderson (R-Alpine) said he agrees with concerns raised by the American Civil Liberties Union that the proposal failed to give gun owners a right to first argue their case for keeping firearms to a court. “This bill poses a significant threat to our civil liberties,” Anderson said. The bill that would prohibit Californians from buying more than one rifle or shotgun in any 30-day period drew opposition from groups including the National Rifle Assn. and Outdoor Sportsmen’s Coalition. “Firearms ownership by individuals is a constitutionally protected right of all adults,” the coalition said in a statement to lawmakers. “Limiting all adults to a maximum of one rifle or shotgun purchase per month will not solve crime and mental health problems.” Advertisement A measure sent to the governor that would require those seeking concealed weapon permits to complete at least eight hours of safety classes and pass a live-fire test was denounced by the Firearms Policy Coalition, which advocates for gun owners. The requirement “casually enacts a burdensome new mandate and then leaves it up to hundreds of different law enforcement agencies to determine how it should be interpreted and applied,” the policy coalition said. California has the strictest gun laws in the country and has pioneered many rules, becoming the first state to ban assault weapons in 1989 after a shooting at a Stockton elementary school left five students dead. In 2016, lawmakers expanded restrictions on assault weapons amid public outrage over a terrorist attack a year earlier that left 14 dead and 24 injured in San Bernardino. Advertisement Brown, who has acknowledged owning a rifle, has approved stricter rules in the past on assault rifles and large-capacity ammunition magazines, but he vetoed a bill in 2015 that would have barred the purchase of more than one long gun a month. “Given California’s stringent laws restricting gun ownership, I do not believe this additional restriction is needed,” he wrote that year. During hours of debate by the two legislative houses on the various bills, California legislators specifically credited the student activists from Parkland and elsewhere who marched in Washington, D.C., and at statehouses across the country to demand that more be done to reduce gun violence. In introducing the bill that would raise the age limit for buying long guns, Sen. Anthony Portantino (D- La Cañada Flintridge) gave credit to the activists such as Sari. Advertisement “Out of respect for young people across our country who are demanding action we must answer their plea for help,” he said. The rifle used in the Parkland shooting is already restricted in California as an assault weapon. The approval of the age limit bill followed the lead of Florida, which enacted a similar law in March, shortly after the Parkland shooting. Sari was part of a group of Parkland students who went to the Florida state Capitol in Tallahassee and successfully lobbied legislators to pass the new age limit for gun purchases. Advertisement She said she hopes Brown, who is a Democrat, follows the lead of Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott in enacting stricter gun laws. “My message to [Brown] would be that he should encourage other states to the do the same and be sure that he signs the bills because it’s really how to increase safety,” Sari said. patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com Twitter: @mcgreevy99",Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Shooting Mass shooting Nikolas Cruz School shooting Gun control Gun Alyssa Alhadeff Murder,"A sign outside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., where 17 students and employees were killed in February.","Nearly 30 years after California became the first state to ban the sale of assault weapons and embarked on a path toward the strictest firearm laws in the nation, legislators have sent Gov.

Unfortunately, this is a reality that has become all too familiar across the U.S. From Pittsburgh, Aurora, Parkland, Orlando, Las Vegas, Newtown and South Carolina, it is clear that firearms violence has become a public health epidemic in America. As president of the American College of Physicians (ACP) our professional organization represents members who have seen first-hand the devastating impact firearms violence has had on our patients and the communities we serve. The failure to implement meaningful and long-lasting gun control legislation undermines our country’s and our health care system’s foundational values. ADVERTISEMENT On Tuesday, Oct. 30, ACP updated a comprehensive set of recommendations to support the public’s health in our policy paper, Reducing Firearm-Related Injuries and Deaths in the U.S. Originally published in 2014, the paper reaffirms our position that firearms violence is a critical threat to the health of our country. The new recommendations support laws to prohibit persons with a history of domestic violence — including persons subject to restraining orders —from buying and possessing firearms; support extreme risk prevention laws to allow family members to seek an immediate court order to remove guns from a family member who is at risk of using firearms to inflict harm on themselves or others; and support laws to require adults to store guns and ammunition safely and securely. The paper also reaffirms ACP’s call for a ban on the sale of “assault” weapons and a ban on bump stocks and large-capacity ammunition magazines, with additional guidance to legislators on how to define which weapons should be subject to such a ban. ACP has been advocating for a shift in the narrative on gun violence for two decades and has recently developed policy recognizing hate crimes as a public health issue. In today’s landscape and in light of the recent tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, which was fueled by anti-Semitism, ACP recommends that physicians address the increase in firearms-related injuries and deaths with legislators and with patients. A pledge in the annals of internal medicine urges physicians to counsel patients on safe firearm behaviors and to make it a priority to take further action when a patient is at risk. These might be difficult conversations to have with patients, but they are critically important to our public health. While we have broadened the national dialogue on mental health and how it relates to gun violence, more must be done to truly move the needle forward. ACP has long called for increased access to mental health services — particularly for patients who may pose a risk of harming themselves or others. We recommend that all physicians be trained to work with patients who are living with a mental illness and that mental health services be consistently available to patients in need throughout their lives — surely that’s something both sides of the aisle can rally behind.

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the U.S. Department of Education was considering a plan that would allow schools to buy firearms for teachers using money from a federal grant program originally designed to support student enrichment, an unprecedented step that would turn an NRA fever dream into official public policy. However, an anonymous administration official has now pushed back a bit, telling CNN on Thursday that the idea “did not originate with the Department of Education” or Secretary Betsy DeVos, and that the government was only evaluating a request from the Texas Department of Education. The federal department does not seem to have ruled the concept out entirely, however. Donald Trump broached the idea of arming teachers in order to prevent shootings after the Feb. 14 massacre in Parkland, Florida. The National Rifle Association has long advocated allowing educators carry weapons on campus, and several states already allow them. But the president’s comments thrust the issue into the middle of the national debate. According to the New York Times’ initial report, Congress typically bars schools from spending federal funding on guns. But the Department of Education has been examining whether districts could pay for weapons using Student Support and Academic Enrichment grants, which were created as part of the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015. The $1 billion program is pretty much what it sounds like: The money is intended to help schools provide students with a well-rounded education, bring technology into classrooms, and create a healthy learning environment through “comprehensive school mental health, drug and violence prevention.” But there’s nothing in the law that explicitly says the money can’t be used for setting up English teachers with pistols, and the Department of Education has supposedly been trying to figure out whether that might fall under the rubric of “improving school conditions.” The administration is now telling CNN that it only began looking into the issue after it received a letter from the Texas Department of Education asking if the grants could be used that way, and that after researching the issue, it decided not to respond. But the department doesn’t seem to have quashed the idea entirely. Per CNN: The official added that DeVos thinks that Congress should take action to clarify whether or not using the grant funding to buy guns is permissible. Moreover, the Education Department believes the grant program is intentionally vague to give school districts flexibility, and the idea of purchasing firearms was likely not considered when it was written, according to the official. In response to the Times report, Education Department spokeswoman Liz Hill told CNN that “the department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety. The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” It seems unlikely that Congress will pass a bill anytime soon explicitly saying that, yes, schools can use student enrichment grants to build up a weapons cache, so perhaps deflecting to Capitol Hill is just a way of punting on the issue. Or maybe not! Still, anybody who may have thought that arming teachers to prevent school shootings was just a plainly disingenuous talking point Republicans were lobbing out to counter calls for gun control after Parkland should think again.

In a tweet this month, the NRA told ""anti-gun"" doctors to ""stay in their lane"" after a series of research papers about firearm injuries and deaths was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, including new recommendations to reduce gun violence The NRA, which marked 147 years as an active organization over the weekend, wrote in the tweet, ""Someone should tell self-important anti-gun doctors to stay in their lane.

The tweet was posted hours before a gunman opened fire in the Borderline Bar & Grill in Thousand Oaks, California, killing 12 people before turning the gun on himself. The tweet garnered more than 3,000 likes and more than 22,000 comments -- a few in support of the gun rights group , but most of them pushing back.

In addition to caring for gun-related injuries and their long-term consequences, ""we need rigorous research to better understand the crisis, test solutions, and learn how best to implement and sustain those that work,"" they wrote. ""To date, the ability to study important questions that might help reduce firearm-related injury has been hampered by a lack of funding and a worry among researchers that studying anything related to guns could put their research careers at risk.

""In addition to raising funds to support research, AFFIRM aims to sponsor the development of practice recommendations based on sound science and the education and training to implement them,"" Taichman, Bornstein and Laine wrote. ""Doctors have a responsibility as health care professionals and scientists to seek the answers to questions related to health and safety.

""Those who seek to silence progress toward finding solutions to the crisis of firearm-related injury are traveling a lane that leads, literally, to a dead end. We're going to stay in our lane and keep moving forward."" Gun violence also has continued to be a major area of interest among researchers outside the medical community. On Friday, a panel of gun violence experts presented their latest findings and what the public can learn from them at the American Society of Criminology Annual Meeting in Atlanta. Among the panelists was Daniel Webster, a professor and director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research ""Physicians, particularly the trauma care physicians and emergency medicine physicians, see the end result of gun violence, and it is a very brutal, powerful thing. One thing that is apparent to many of them is because these injuries are so devastating, prevention is particularly important,"" Webster said.

They encounter patients who are depressed, who may have substance abuse disorders, mental health problems, a whole range of things, that may increase their risk for suicide,"" Webster said. ""While they're interested in getting them the best health and medical care to address to those things, to keep them alive, one of the most important things is removing firearms,"" he said. ""So talking to patients and their families about removing firearms and the safe storage of firearms, is really important -- and it's a really important role for physicians, and I'm very happy that many of them are taking that on."" Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. Jack McDevitt, a professor and director of Northeastern University's Institute on Race and Justice who also was among the panelists, thinks physicians can help reduce gun violence and crime simply by talking to their patients. ""What we know in the criminology literature, for example, is that when people desist from crime, when they stop committing crime, it's usually because of someone important in their life. But it's not always the same person -- it could be a spouse; it could be a coach; it could be an employer; it could be a teacher -- who made an influence on them,"" McDevitt said. ""So having another voice of a doctor who's respected who says, 'You know, maybe you want to get the gun out of the house temporarily?' Or, 'Maybe you want to think about this differently?' Or, 'Here's a program you might want to go to.' I think there's nothing wrong with that,"" he said.

On Feb. 25, a new CNN poll showed 70 percent of respondents want stricter gun laws, the organizationreported. That figure was up from a poll CNN conducted in October, which showed the number at 52 percent following the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history, at a country music festival in Las Vegas. The increase in number of people responding in favor of gun law reforms is notable because it doesn't just show a shift over the past few months, according to CNN, but well beyond. The only other time a CNN poll had 70 percent of respondents supporting stricter gun measures, the organization said, came in December 1993. People are pictured at a memorial the day students and parents arrive for voluntary campus orientation at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School following last week's mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., Feb. 25, 2018. Angel Valentin/Reuters At that time, the Brady Bill which required background checks and a waiting period on gun purchases had just been passed. The Brady Bill pre-dated the current National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The recent CNN poll showed that overall support for stricter gun laws included 57 percent of individuals who identified as being a part of gun-owning households. Republicans who supported stricter gun laws in the poll, 49 percent, outweighed those who opposed them at 46 percent. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Feb. 20, five days before the CNN poll and six days after the Parkland shooting, showed a divide over how to move forward on a potential ban on assault weapons. In the poll, 50 percent of respondents supported banning assault weapons and 46 percent opposed any ban. More women, 55 percent, supported a ban than men, 43 percent.

The majority -- 66 percent -- supported an assault weapon ban in the Northeast, versus other parts of the country that showed somewhere in the 40-percent range supported a ban. The division over an assault weapons ban is not new. The results of this ABC News/Washington Post poll echoes the split of 51 percent supporting and 48 percent opposing an assault weapons ban in the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando in June 2016.

And the NRA is facing a time-honored traditional protest: the boycott. The perks of NRA membership include discounts and benefits with a variety of companies, including car rental, air travel, insurance, and banking. Those are some of the practical incentives that keep members paying their dues to the organization. Since the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, #boycottNRA has been trending on Twitter, and users and customers have demanded that companies pull out of their partnerships with NRA. So far, it's been shockingly effective. On Thursday, the First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately-owned bank in the country, announced that it would no longer be offering an NRA credit card in response to ""customer feedback."" More companies have followed suit, including Enterprise Holdings, which owns major car rental companies like Alamo and Enterprise, with Hertz soon joining in. Mother Jones is keeping a list of NRA business partners jumping ship, but the biggest blows so far have come from major airlines: both United and Delta announced on Twitter that they were ending deals for NRA members. Major companies like FedEx are still offering discounts to NRA members, while Amazon, Apple, Google, and YouTube are all drawing fire for hosting the increasingly deranged NRA TV. Of course, this could provide the NRA with more fodder. As the New York Times points out, with a ridiculously NRA-friendly president and Congress, the organization can't rely on painting itself and its members as victims of a coming liberal gun round-up.

Fueled by the death of 49 Pulse patrons, the newly formed group called itself Gays Against Guns, or GAG. Since its inception, Gays Against Guns — which counts several alumni of storied AIDS activist group ACT UP! among its members — set its sights on a big target: the National Rifle Association. The group even coined a campy catchphrase for the mission: “NRA, Sashay Away!” GAG’s long-term strategy to take down the NRA started with a decision to “follow the money,” in particular, the gun lobby’s corporate partners, like Wyndham, Hertz and FedEx. “We typically have two tiers of action, there’s typically an art component that expresses our sensibilities and the second tier is direct action,"" John Grauwiler, a GAG leader, told NBC News. GAG staged monthly direct actions by protesting and distributing fliers outside FedEx stores across the country, and also staged a 26-hour, nonstop protest outside the company’s corporate offices in Manhattan in the spring of 2018. “It was a lot of effort, but we were there,” Grauwiler said. The Morning Rundown Get a head start on the morning's top stories. This site is protected by recaptcha So when FedEx announced Monday that it was ending its business partnerships with many organizations — including the NRA — GAG claimed victory. “GRASSROOTS ACTIVISM WERKS!!!” the group wrote on its Instagram page. “EVERY NATIONAL CHAPTER of Gays Against Guns has been protesting FedEx EVERY SINGLE MONTH, and calling for a boycott, because they were the ONLY major corporation that hadn’t severed its ties with the National Rifle Association after the Parkland shooting. But now, in the wake of the Tree of Life massacre, they have FINALLY MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE!” For its part, FedEx denied that the GAG protests had anything to do with their change in policy, saying more than 100 organizations had their discount programs terminated. FedEx had offered a 26 percent discount to card-carrying NRA members who shipped guns with the parcel carrier. “The alliances involved in this transition don’t have the shipping volumes to sustain a dedicated program,” FedEx spokesman Jim McCluskey said in a statement provided to NBC News. The FedEx “transition” follows two years of organized protests by Gays Against Guns against the NRA and the organizations that do business with it. The group has protested in the lobby of the Blackstone Group in Midtown Manhattan. GAG’s “Human Beings” — veiled figures marching silently to represent the lives lost to gun violence — have strolled the beaches of Fire Island and pride marches across the country. After the Valentine's Day shooting at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, which killed 17 people, the group traveled down to Florida to provide support, and they distributed Human Being kits to some of the grieving townspeople. In the 2018 New York Pride March, GAG’s Human Beings marched again, behind a banner reading “104 WILL BE KILLED TODAY,” and held placards with information about more recent lives lost to gun violence, like Peter Wang, a 15-year-old boy from Parkland: “Peter was shot while holding a door open to let fellow classmates get to safety,” the placard read. “His selfless and heroic actions saved many of his friends.” Grauwiler, who joined ACT UP! in 1989 at the age of 19, said “I learned a lot about organizing, and I learned how to talk through the media, the importance of direct action and civil disobedience, and I learned that through those initiatives, that’s where you find empowerment, and that’s where you inspire others to do the same thing.” GAG has attracted attention for its direct actions, also known as “zaps,"" which are in the same spirit of some of ACT UP!’s most headline-grabbing stunts. The group staged a takeover of the Food and Drug Administration to demand more aggressive testing and rollout of HIV medications; the FDA complied within a year.

The 97-year-old Stevens says in an essay on The New York Times website that repeal would weaken the National Rifle Association’s ability to “block constructive gun control legislation.” Stevens was on the losing end of a 2008 ruling in which the high court held that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to own a gun for self-defense. He had previously called for changing the Second Amendment to permit gun control. Stevens says the decision in that case, District of Columbia v. Heller, “has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power.” Stevens retired from the court in 2010, after more than 35 years. In his essay published Tuesday, Stevens talks about the “March for Our Lives” events on Saturday which drew crowds in cities across the country. Stevens said the demonstrations “reveal the broad public support for legislation to minimize the risk of mass killings of schoolchildren and others in our society.” He said the support “is a clear sign to lawmakers to enact legislation prohibiting civilian ownership of semiautomatic weapons, increasing the minimum age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 years old, and establishing more comprehensive background checks on all purchasers of firearms.” But Stevens called on demonstrators to “seek more effective and more lasting reform.” “They should demand a repeal of the Second Amendment,” he wrote.

He recently sat down with NRA TV host and guns rights activist Colion Noir to defend gun ownership and said he discouraged his children from taking part in the high school walkouts from earlier this month. ""I told my kids on the school walkout: 'I love you but if you walk out that school, walk out my house.'"" The Run The Jewels MC is known for his strong political stances on racism, mass incarceration, and other issues, and while this interview might have caught some by surprise, he's been an outspoken NRA supporter (and member) for quite some time. In Mike's view, the important discussions about gun control should include voices from both sides. He also said that gun owners want violence against children to end, though they disagree on how to achieve that. ""I have worked as a tireless advocate of children and disenfranchised women in my community. And I have also worked with gun groups like Georgians Against Gun Violence [...] If there's a table to be sat at, the gun owner needs to be there, so I try to see the problem from the whole perspective,"" he said in the clip. Mike and the host echoed similar ideas and claimed that though they may be viewed as ""lackeys"" for the NRA, the onus of that title is actually on everyone else. “You’re a lackey of the progressive movement because you’ve never disagreed with the people who tell you what to do,” the rapper explained. The conversation shifted slightly to focus on the March for Our Lives protests, namely regarding the financial support it has received thus far. “Our biggest celebrities are donating millions to a march while our inner-city schools are in deplorable conditions,” said Noir, to which Mike agreed and added, ""Celebrities are told what to do."" He went on to take down not only anti-gun campaigns but shared that he declined to do an anti-bullying drop for an unnamed radio station. ""Your child needs to get punched in the face so he can learn to punch someone back,"" he said. ""You have to develop the aptitude to fight back.

""You know, I would Jake,"" Bullock told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday morning when asked if he would support a ban on semiautomatic weapons. ""Now, there are things that we can do immediately, everything from red flag laws to closing, sort of having a universal background check, to making sure that we're doing everything we can, some age restrictions, magazine restrictions.

In it, Bullock made a significant change in his views on gun policy and said he supports universal background checks. As more and more speculation about him potentially running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020 arises, he is taking his views on guns even closer to the views of the majority of Democrats nationwide. This marks a stark change from Bullock's re-election campaign for governor in 2016, when his campaign released a statement responding to an attack from his Republican opponent, Greg Gianforte. The statement said, ""Steve Bullock supports Montana's current laws when it comes to gun rights. He opposes universal background checks, he has expanded gun rights as governor and he will always stand up for the Second Amendment.""

885,885,322,http://www.yahoo.com/news/shooting-suspect-twice-hospitalized-mental-illness-052752901.html,Shooting suspect was able to buy guns despite mental illness,"""BALTIMORE (AP) — The young man who opened fire at a Florida video game tournament had shown abundant signs he was struggling with a mental disorder: He was prescribed an anti-psychotic drug as an adolescent and had been hospitalized at least twice for mental illness. Yet David Katz landed at the foggy intersection of America's mental health and legal systems when it came to buying the two handguns that police say he carried during the attack, which killed two people and wounded 10 others during the """"Madden NFL 19"""" competition in Jacksonville. The rampage ended when the 24-year-old Baltimore man fatally shot himself. Experts say the gunman's history of mental illness apparently would not have stopped him from buying guns in Maryland, where buyers cannot pass a background check if they were either involuntarily committed for any period of time or voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility for at least 30 consecutive days. Court papers filed in his parent's bitter divorce do not clearly indicate whether Katz was hospitalized voluntarily or involuntarily, and the two hospitalizations described in the documents were both shorter than 30 days. In addition, Katz's hospitalizations may have occurred before the Maryland General Assembly revamped the state's firearms laws following the 2007 mass shooting at Virginia Tech. """"It appears that these disqualifications did not apply to David Katz,"""" said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. The Jacksonville shooting is just the latest U.S. case to illustrate the complexities of keeping dangerously unstable people from purchasing guns. A Maryland legislator said the attack highlights the need to review laws governing the length of time someone can be voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric facility and still pass a background check for firearms. """"That clearly is an area in need of reform,"""" said Democratic Sen. Robert Zirkin, who chairs a Senate committee that handles gun laws. Maryland lawmakers will gather in January for their annual 90-day legislative session in Annapolis, where people are still grieving the loss of five people gunned down at a newspaper office earlier this year. The gunman's attorneys are considering an insanity defense. Under federal law, people are generally prohibited from acquiring guns if they have ever been involuntarily committed to a psychiatric facility. Nationally, there's no federal requirement for psychiatric hospitals or courts to report involuntary commitments to the FBI for inclusion in a database used for gun-purchase background checks. Some states have their own laws. In Maryland, where Katz purchased a 9mm handgun and .45-caliber handgun, state law requires courts to report to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System whenever people are declared mentally incompetent to stand trial or assigned a guardian because they cannot manage their affairs. In addition, Maryland law requires psychiatric facilities that admit an individual to submit a report to the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. As part of the gun-purchase application, Maryland state police require applicants' written authorization for the state health agency to disclose whether they suffer from a mental disorder, have a history of violent behavior or have been confined for more than 30 consecutive days to a mental health facility. Maryland state troopers are responsible for investigating gun purchases, but for now they are not talking to avoid interfering with the investigation in Jacksonville, spokesman Greg Shipley said. Katz's parents frequently disagreed on how to care for their troubled son, with his father at times claiming his estranged wife was exaggerating symptoms of mental illness. The couple divorced in 2007. The suspect's father, Richard Katz of Baltimore, and his mother, Elizabeth Katz of Columbia, Maryland, did not respond to phone messages from The Associated Press. Efforts to reach them and other relatives at their homes were also unsuccessful. A psychologist once warned a family court that David Katz might become violent. Katz """"could lash out and become so angry that he would hit and hurt his mother,"""" Dr. Paul Berman told the court. The divorce papers in Howard County, Maryland, say Katz started obsessively playing video games as a boy, sometimes refusing to go to school or to bathe. Elizabeth Katz, a toxicologist who worked at the Department of Agriculture, said in court papers that she would confiscate some of her son's gaming equipment after finding him playing games in the wee hours. At one point, she put his gaming controllers in her bedroom behind a locked door and he punched a hole in the door, she said. When a boy, he sometimes """"curled up into a ball,"""" refused to attend school and sobbed, she said. She asserted that her ex-husband, a NASA engineer, instructed David not to take Risperidal — an anti-psychotic medication prescribed to him. In late 2007, Katz was admitted to the Sheppard Pratt mental health system near his Maryland home for about 12 days. Court documents say a psychiatrist at that time administered antidepressants. He later spent about 13 days at Potomac Ridge, a mental health services facility in Rockville. __ Witte reported from Annapolis, Maryland.

972,972,10641,http://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-school-shooting-salvador-castro-20180201-story.html,Let's hope the Salvador Castro Middle School shooting finally wakes up L.A. Unified on school safety,"The Thursday morning shooting at Salvador Castro Middle School in Westlake brings clashing concerns about weapons on campus face to face. On one side are civil rights advocates, as well as some parents and charter school operators, who decry the Los Angeles Unified School District’s policy of randomly searching students every day at every middle and high school, using metal detecting wands. It’s humiliating and interrupts school time, they justifiably contend. On the other side are district officials and parents who say, with equal justification, that any embarrassment is minor compared with the safety issue of keeping deadly weapons off campus. Some will look at the most recently shooting, which critically injured a 15-year-old boy, as evidence that the searches are needed. Others will see an ineffective policy that didn’t prevent a gun injury on campus. The shame of the matter is that no one really knows because, despite years of challenges to the random searches (known as “wanding”), the district still hasn’t taken a comprehensive look at whether its policy is effective. Nor has it examined whether other forms of violence protection might be just as effective without the intrusiveness that fosters a culture of mistrust between students and school staff. Advertisement During the 2014-15 school year, searches yielded more than 800 weapons, most of them knives and blades. Fifteen were firearms. But in addition to finding contraband, district officials insist, the random searches serve as a deterrent and that the numbers of weapons being carried on campus would be much higher without it. Maybe that’s true. Maybe not. The problem is that, more than a year and a half after this page called on the district to gather the necessary facts, it still hasn’t gotten to the bottom of the issue. Despite years of challenges to the random searches (or ‘wanding’), the district still hasn’t taken a comprehensive look at whether its policy is effective. What it has done is an audit that found the search policy was followed erratically, lending credence to critics who describe the searches as uneven and unfair, targeting some students over others. Despite the district’s rules, some schools don’t conduct searches every day. Some don’t have enough wands to get the job done. And this was an audit of only 20 schools; who knows what’s going on at scores more? Advertisement Late last year, acting Supt. Vivian Ekchian said she would commission a survey of attitudes about the searches. But this is about much more than attitudes; the key issue isn’t how people feel about weapons searches, but whether they are necessary to keep students safe. The district could run its own experiment with different security measures at various campuses, including safe passage programs to help students get safely to and from school. Opponents of the searches have contended that providing transportation would do more to ensure student safety than any number of metal-detecting wands. School leaders also could look outside the district for answers: The National Center for Education Statistics reports that random weapons searches have lost favor at many schools. In 2000, 7% of schools around the country conducted the searches; by 2014, that had dropped to 4%. What has happened at the schools that stopped? Are they just as safe? Perhaps even safer? What methods are they using? Or, perhaps, weapons have become problematic at those schools, indicating that searches are justified. L.A. Unified began the random searches after two 1993 shooting incidents in which students were killed on campus. That’s an understandable reaction. But crime rates have fallen dramatically in the decades since then, and the policy needs a thorough examination. Advertisement The district has an unfortunate tendency to institute programs without the necessary follow-up to ensure that they actually work. Issues dangle instead of being resolved. That’s what happened when the district took notice of its problems with chronic truancy. It started a few attendance pilots at various schools but never looked into which ones should be expanded and which ones had little effect. Ultimately, an outside panel delved into the issue and came up with a plan that the district recently embraced. Safety on campus is an even more important matter. We’d rather do without the searches if possible; students should be treated like eager learners, not suspects. But it would be even worse for students to feel — and be — in danger. District officials need to get beyond the debate and get the evidence on how to protect students properly. Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinionand Facebook",Salvador B.

The divisive gun organization’s spokeswoman Dana Loesch, who was hosting her show Relentless, wasn’t happy that two female characters, Rebecca and Nia, are joining Thomas, Percy, and the gang, declaring the decision “horrible” and launching on what can only be described as a bizarre rant as an image splashed on the screen of the famous trains wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods. Loesch was especially angry that one of the female characters is from Kenya. “Thomas the Tank is now bringing gender balance to the show by adding girl trains. Seriously,” she snipped about the preschool show, which she dubbed “creepy.” Loesch ranted that the show doesn’t need “ethnic diversity” when it “literally has no ethnicities because they’re trains. … “I’m really, really struggling to understand how in the world there isn’t any diversity in any of this,” she said as the controversial image of the trains, in KKK hoods, on burning tracks appeared. “Oh, I see it — it was the white hoods. And the burning train tracks. OK, fine, fair point. Fair. I get it. Thomas the Tank Engine has been a blight on race relations for far too long. Clearly this is overdue. Right? Seriously? With trains?” The new train, Nia, who is from Kenya, seemed to especially bother the NRA spokesperson. (Photo: Mattel) More Mattel, owner of the Thomas the Tank Engine brand, issued a statement to the New York Times saying it had “always been a priority” for the company to promote kindness and inclusivity. “We are not associated with images that promote hate and denounce any images of our brands that are being used to convey a message not in line with the values of the company.” Many of the people who saw the segment were confused by the National Rifle Association’s need to weigh in on children’s programming when it has absolutely nothing — zero — to do with guns. It seemed unnecessarily hateful to many and was called “disturbing as hell” and “sick” on social media. Director Judd Apatow called the group “a hateful nightmare” with “dumb, vicious people” and urged people to “vote in November.” This is the NRA’s totally reasonable, super clever, and not a little bit racist response to a Nigerian train character being introduced. Because… that character existing means…Thomas was in the KKK before? Or something? Ok, I give up.

A New Jersey woman who reported racist, threatening messages sent to her on Facebook from a man in Kentucky may have thwarted a school shooting when she reported the posts to authorities in both states, according to officials. Kentucky State Police received a complaint from the woman on Wednesday, stating that the man -- who resides in Anderson County -- was harassing her on social media, Sgt. Josh Lawson of the Kentucky State Police public affairs division said in a press conference last week. In one of the messages, the suspect, 21-year-old Dylan Jarrell, allegedly called the woman a ""wanna be black woman"" and told her he hopes her ""black children get hung for you being so stupid,"" Koeberle Bull, the woman who reported Jarrell to authorities, told The Washington Post. Other messages allegedly read, ""There's no such thing as white privileged"" and ""please you and your monkey children go die."" Bull, who is white, reported the messages because she was worried for her three biracial children, she told The Post. While Bull's Facebook page shows her with her three children, ages 8, 11, and 16, she does not know why Jarrell targeted her, she told the newspaper. After combing through Jarrell's social media account and finding other concerning posts, police encountered him as he was backing out of his driveway Thursday afternoon and ""found evidence of a credible and imminent threat"" to the Shelby and Anderson County School districts after interviewing him, Lawson said. Officers also found a firearm, more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a Kevlar vest, a 100-round high-capacity magazine and a detailed plan of the attack in Jarrell's possession, Lawson said. Dylan Jarrell in a police booking photo. Shelby County Detention Center After executing a search warrant on Jarrell's home and electronic devices, investigators also found that he had searched ""how to successfully conduct a school shooting,"" Lawson said. Jarrell was charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications, Lawson said. He is currently being held at the Shelby County Detention Center without bond, jail records show. In May, the FBI questioned Jarrell over threats made on social media to a school in Tennessee, according to Kentucky State Police. ABC News could not immediately reach an attorney for him. Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders commended the New Jersey woman who reported the violent content of Jarrell's alleged messages and the federal and local law enforcement agencies involved for the swift investigation. ""We often hear from the community, 'Well, why should I call the police? You guys aren't gonna do anything,'"" Sanders said. ""This is an example of how, when you call the police, and we work closely together, we do something about it."" Jarrell allegedly ""had it in his mind to go to schools and create havoc,"" Sanders said, adding that law enforcement has ""every reason to believe"" he was backing out of the driveway in an attempt to commit the ""heinous act."" ""He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary, and the only thing that stood between him and evil ... is law enforcement,"" Sanders said. The motive behind the alleged threats is unclear.

During the program's “Unplugged” segment, Noah addressed the recent shooting at a mall in Hoover, Ala. that left one dead and two wounded on Thanksgiving night. The person killed by police, 21-year-old black Army veteran Emantic Bradford Jr., who was legally carrying a gun, was mistaken for the shooter and the real shooter could still be at large. “The question I ask myself is how does this s**t keep happening? Cops are called into a situation, they see a black person, and then immediately they shoot,” Noah told his audience. “That’s what they did here. They ran in, they shot the guy, and then they were like ‘We got him.’” ""How many times have we seen a shooter who is white and a man get talked down?” he asked, citing the shooters in Aurora and Charleston. While noting other shooters have killed themselves, Noah said when it comes to black men, it’s “shoot immediately” and “ask questions later.” 'If you’re a black man, you have no business bearing arms at all' — Trevor Noah “There are so many things that bug me about this story. Because by the looks of it, it sounds like this was a good guy with a gun. That’s what they always say, a ‘good guy with a gun stops the crime,’” Noah continued. “But if the good guy with a gun happens to be a black good guy with a gun, they don’t get any of the benefits.” The late-night comedian slammed the Hoover Police Department for their statement declaring they got the shooter, a statement they later apologized for, and how multiple people had reportedly pulled out their guns but that the “only person who was shot by police was a black guy.” Trevor Noah: Trump's 'superhuman stupidity' led president to discount his own administration's climate report “At this point, you start to realize that really the Second Amendment is not intended for black people,” Noah said. “It’s an uncomfortable thing to say, but it’s the truth. Like people will be like ‘the right to bear arms.’ Yes, the right to bear arms if you’re not a black man. If you’re a black man, you have no business bearing arms at all."" The “Daily Show” host also cited a recent incident involving a black security guard who was shot and killed after being mistaken for an armed assailant. “If you’re black and you’re a man in America, gun rights are not for you,” Noah reiterated. “If you’re a black person in America, gun rights are not for you. It’s as simple as that. In fact, the safest way to sell a black person a gun in America is to say that when you buy a gun you should buy a white person with it and they hold the gun for you.” “Some bulls**t, but it’s the truth,” he added. “Second Amendment was not made for black folks. “",The Daily Show Trevor Noah Television presenter Late-night talk show Late night television Comedian Television Television show Comedy Central,"Trevor Noah said that when the Second Amendment was not intended for black people, it’s not intended for black people.","The “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah got serious Tuesday night on the subjects of guns, police and race.

He is Ari Mahler, who came forward for the first time over the weekend to tell the story of Oct. 27 in a powerful social media post. The Facebook post, which has been shared more than 133,000 times as of early Monday, began, “I am The Jewish Nurse."" From there, it chronicled how Mahler found empathy for the suspected perpetrator of the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history at a time when the world fixated on his hatred. AD AD “Love. That’s why I did it,” Mahler wrote in the Facebook post. “Love as an action is more powerful than words, and love in the face of evil gives others hope. It demonstrates humanity. It reaffirms why we’re all here. … I could care less what Robert Bowers thinks, but you, the person reading this, love is the only message I wish to instill in you.” I am The Jewish Nurse. Yes, that Jewish Nurse. The same one that people are talking about in the Pittsburgh shooting... Posted by Ari Mahler on Saturday, November 3, 2018 A spokesman for Allegheny General Hospital confirmed the authenticity of Mahler’s claim and the Facebook post to The Washington Post. Mahler declined further comment. Mahler’s story first emerged when Allegheny General Hospital President Jeffrey Cohen, who is also Jewish and a member of Tree of Life synagogue, told multiple news outlets that a Jewish nurse and Jewish doctor were among the first to treat the suspected shooter. The 46-year-old Bowers, who has pleaded not guilty to 44 charges, including hate crimes, had suffered multiple gunshot wounds during a shootout with police. AD AD Before Bowers arrived, Mahler had panicked: He worried his parents might be among the victims, he said. But later, as Bowers was wheeled into the emergency room, “I didn’t see evil when I looked into Bower’s eyes,” Mahler wrote. “I saw something else.” “I can tell you that as his nurse, or anyone’s nurse, my care is given through kindness,” he wrote, “my actions are measured with empathy, and regardless of the person you may be when you’re not in my care, each breath you take is more beautiful than the last when you’re lying on my stretcher.” He added that patient privacy laws limited how much he could say about his interactions with Bowers. “This was the same Robert Bowers that just committed mass homicide. The Robert Bowers who instilled panic in my heart worrying my parents were two of his 11 victims less than an hour before his arrival.” Mahler, the son of a rabbi, said in his post that the “fact that this shooting took place doesn’t shock me.” AD AD He cited statistics about hate crimes targeting Jewish people, saying, “I don’t know why people hate us so much, but the underbelly of anti-Semitism seems to be thriving."" The FBI found most recently in 2016 that Jews were victims of 54 percent of all anti-religious hate crimes, despite accounting for only about 2 percent of the U.S. population. Mahler had experienced plenty of anti-Semitism as a kid, he wrote. He had found drawings left on desks showing his family being marched into gas chambers, swastikas drawn on his locker and notes left inside reading, “Die Jew. Love, Hitler.” And so when he emerged nameless in headlines suddenly as “The Jewish Nurse,” all in stories that had celebrated his religious identity, the experience was almost foreign to him — “awkward,” he called it. I just want to say that I’m truly in disbelief, but all the more grateful, for the outpouring of love and support. On... Posted by Ari Mahler on Sunday, November 4, 2018 “When I was a kid, being labeled ‘The Jewish (anything),’ undoubtedly had derogatory connotations attached to it. That’s why it feels so awkward to me that people suddenly look at it as an endearing term,” he wrote. “As an adult, deflecting my religion by saying ‘I’m not that religious,’ makes it easier for people to accept I’m Jewish — especially when I tell them my father is a rabbi. ‘I’m not that religious,’ is like saying, ‘Don’t worry, I’m not that Jewish, therefore I’m not so different than you,’ and like clockwork, people don’t look at me as awkwardly as they did a few seconds beforehand.” AD AD Mahler made a choice as he treated Bowers’s bullet wounds in the emergency room that day, he said. He didn’t think Bowers knew he was Jewish, because Bowers had thanked him, and, “why thank a Jewish nurse, when 15 minutes beforehand, you’d shoot me in the head with no remorse?” he wrote. He decided he would not “say a word to him about my religion.” “I chose not to say anything to him the entire time. I wanted him to feel compassion. I chose to show him empathy. I felt that the best way to honor his victims was for a Jew to prove him wrong. Besides, if he finds out I’m Jewish, does it really matter?

Cody Wilson, founder of Defense Distributed, said at a news conference in Austin, Texas that he would sell the files and ship them to buyers on a flash drive. ""Today I want to clarify, anyone who wants these files will get them,"" Wilson said. ""I'll sell them. I'll ship them."" The files could previously be downloaded for free, but U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik in Seattle, Washington, on Monday issued a nationwide injunction that blocked online distribution of 3-D printed gun files. Josh Blackman, a lawyer for Wilson, said in a statement on Tuesday that the court expressly allowed Wilson to mail files. Lasnik did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Monday's decision blocked a settlement between the Trump administration and Defense Distributed, which argued that the U.S. Constitution guaranteed access to the online blueprints under the First Amendment right to free speech and the Second Amendment right to bear arms. ""Wilson is trying to push the boundaries over what the U.S. Constitution protects and the court will have to clarify whether the injunction goes far enough to cover flash drives,"" said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University who has written a book on gun litigation. Files available on Defense Distributed's website included blueprints of components for a version of the AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle, used in several U.S. mass shootings. They were available for purchase at a suggested price of $10 each. A group of 19 U.S. states and the District of Columbia sued the U.S. government in July, arguing that publishing the blueprints would allow criminals easy access to weapons. They said the Trump administration had failed to explain why it settled the case. ""We knew this fight wouldn't end with yesterday's court order, and this is just the latest attempt by Cody Wilson to put his own selfish, asinine interests ahead of public safety,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the gun control advocacy groups opposing the blueprints as part of the litigation. Story continues Gardiner in a statement said her group would continue to work with state AGs to prevent access to the files, but declined to comment on whether the group would take additional legal steps. The U.S. State Department, which had previously banned the blueprints as a national security risk and a violation of arms trafficking regulations, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Gun control proponents are concerned the weapons made from 3-D printers will be untraceable, undetectable ""ghost"" firearms that threaten global security. Some gun rights groups say the technology is expensive, the guns unreliable and the threat overblown. They also say undetectable guns wholly made of plastic are illegal in the United States.

The Firearms Policy Coalition complained in a letter that the group, along with one of its members, could not reply to a tweet from the councilman about his proposed ban on downloading blueprints for 3-D printed guns. It demanded that Englander stop blocking them, saying that its members “have a right to reply to your tweets and criticize your proposed legislation.” And it pointed to a federal ruling that found it was unconstitutional for President Trump to block his online critics on Twitter. In that case, a judge rejected the argument that Trump was acting as a private individual through his @realDonaldTrump account. Advertisement Englander stopped blocking the group after it contacted him. His spokesman, Colin Sweeney, said it had been done in error sometime before the new proposal was introduced. Blocking is nothing unusual in Twitter spats, but civil liberties groups argue that it raises 1st Amendment concerns when government agencies or elected officials hit the button. Government officials cannot discriminate against speakers based on their viewpoint, whether online or at City Hall, such groups charge. If elected officials can block their critics from responding on Twitter, “you’re giving government officials the ability to manipulate the appearance of the public discussion,” said David Greene, civil liberties director for the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “People would look at that and say, ‘Everyone agrees!’” Brandon Combs, president of the Firearms Policy Coalition, said it was important for the group to be able to engage directly with Englander on Twitter, calling it “a public square.” If the councilman had kept blocking the group, Combs said, “it would eliminate the opportunity for us to engage with him and others.” Advertisement Other Twitter users have also complained about being blocked by Englander on the online platform. Torr Leonard, whose handle is @LakeBalboaCA, tweeted about being blocked by Englander nearly four years ago and said he was still blocked as of midday Monday. Alexandra Nagy, an environmental activist who was involved in mobilizing residents after the Aliso Canyon methane leak, said she had been blocked by Englander for a few years. And immigrant rights advocate Carlos Amador said he had been blocked for over a year, after criticizing Englander for opposing funding to provide legal aid to immigrants facing deportation. Amador said he still had plenty of ways to speak up about city issues but was upset to be blocked “for the mere fact that I raised a critical point.” Advertisement Sweeney said that in the aftermath of recent court rulings, Englander has blocked people only “in response to threats or hate speech.” The councilman has also stopped blocking Times reporter David Zahniser, who had been prevented at one point from replying to his tweets. Sweeney did not immediately respond Monday to questions about how many and which accounts were still blocked by the councilman. Englander isn’t the only L.A. council member to face questions about blocking critics: A few Twitter accounts started circulating the hashtag #blockedbycedillo last year, complaining that Councilman Gil Cedillo had cut them off on the platform. Cedillo spokesman Fredy Ceja said no one is blocked from @gilcedillocd1, which is run by the council office and labeled as his “Official Twitter.” But Twitter user Jon Leibowitz said he was still blocked by the politician through another account. Ceja said that account, @gilcedillo, was “campaign related” and run by a different team. Advertisement Mayor Eric Garcetti is not blocking anyone from following his official @MayorofLA account, his spokeswoman Anna Bahr said Monday. However, some Twitter users have complained publicly about being blocked from another account, @ericgarcetti, which states that it is “not paid for, sponsored by, or hosted by city of L.A.” Some L.A. council members told The Times they had blocked small numbers of people on Twitter for harassment, spam or “inappropriate material.” Greene said that government officials may use their Twitter accounts in different ways and whether blocking people poses a 1st Amendment problem can hinge on specific, case-by-case details. “If they’re operating their account as a government official, then the 1st Amendment comes into play,” said Brendan Hamme, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. And if that is the case, Hamme said, “you can’t block simply because you disagree with the message.” emily.alpert@latimes.com Advertisement Twitter: @AlpertReyes",Mitchell Englander Los Angeles Official Deborah Vankin City council  Los Angeles City Council Los Angeles Times  Politician,"City Councilman Mitchell Englander, a Los Angeles City Councilman, has been blocked by a City Councilman after a gun-rights group was blocked.","When a gun-rights group wanted to sound off about a new proposal from Los Angeles City Councilman Mitchell Englander, it went to Twitter to respond to him — only to find it had been blocked.

Says ‘Too Many Entrances’ Possibly To Blame In School Shooting,"After at least 10 people were shot and killed at a school in Santa Fe, Texas, the state’s lieutenant governor said the problem may have been that there were too many entrances and exits at the building for guards to monitor ― as opposed to, say, easy access to guns. The attack, which left 10 others wounded, took place on Friday morning at Santa Fe High School. At a press conference later that day, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that in order to prevent other such shootings, officials may have to “look at the design of our schools.” “There are too many entrances and too many exits to our 8,000 campuses in Texas. There aren’t enough people to put a guard at every entrance and exit,” he said, adding that limiting entrances to “one or two” could allow law enforcement to look at everyone who enters. “Had there been one single entrance possibly for every student, maybe he would have been stopped,” Patrick said, referring to the suspected shooter, who, he added, was wearing a long coat with a shotgun under it on a 90-degree day. “We’re going to have to be creative. We’re going to have to think out of the box,” he continued, suggesting that schools might change their start times so not all students arrive at once. Referring to discussions on mass shootings that Gov. Greg Abbott has requested, Patrick said, “That’s why the governor is calling for the roundtable, to discuss every option.” TX Lt Gov Dan Patrick, a fierce opponent of gun control, says today's shooting may have been caused by Texas schools having ""too many entrances and too many exits."" pic.twitter.com/tLByRqL6oX — David Mack (@davidmackau) May 18, 2018 People on Twitter were quick to remark that having only one exit in a building holding about 1,500 students plus teachers and other staffers might not be so safe ― for instance, by making it harder for people to get out in the event of a fire or shooting.

A federal court judge blocked Texan Cody Wilson's website on Tuesday by issuing a temporary injunction. Eight states had sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a ""lone wolf"" gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons. Wilson complied with the judge's order and shut down his Defcad website, which he wanted to turn into the ""WikiLeaks of guns."" But by then, the blueprints he had posted -- after President Donald Trump's administration granted him permission to publish in a settlement to end a five-year legal battle -- had been downloaded thousands of times. ""No matter how badly I win or lose, you can download a gun from the internet,"" Wilson told AFP at the headquarters of Defense Distributed, the company he runs out of a modest factory in Texas capital Austin. ""This attempt by these authorities to go into court and stifle this information drove more people to the website to download it and spread it deeper into the internet."" Sporting a pair of gray jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, the 30-year-old with a close-cropped beard wouldn't appear out of place as a tech executive in Silicon Valley. The ideology he says he is driven by is a defense of the US constitution's first and second amendments -- the rights to free speech and to bear arms. Wilson believes the intense media attention he generated cemented one of his principal goals: to use technology and the spread of gun-making information as a permanent bulwark against any future attempts at gun control in the US. ""We believe that the firearm itself, this implement of violence, is an essential component of force, of sovereignty,"" he says. He concedes that what he has done, and still wants to do, ""offends the conscience"" of some people, but he says ""it's never been illegal in this country to make a firearm -- and the way that you make it shouldn't affect that law."" Story continues - Anarchist philosophy - Wilson subscribes to an anarchist philosophy that the free exchange of ideas on the internet -- in its absolute form -- is a check on government. ""It's a politics that predicted WikiLeaks, predicted Bitcoin, predicted anonymous mail and anonymous communications online,"" he says. The law school dropout has dedicated the last five years of his life to the cause of unfettered online access to gun-making information. ""I'm a publisher. At the end of the day, I do many things, but the main thing that I strive to do is to take my information and put it on the internet,"" he says. Defense Distributed, the company Wilson co-founded in 2013 and currently heads, is more than a publishing firm -- it sells actual firearms products. It has created a machine called the ""Ghost Gunner,"" priced at $2,000. Computer code operates the machine, which carves essential components of various firearms to create weapons without serial numbers. - 'Ghost guns' - Such weapons -- called ""ghost guns"" -- are already being made by those who can properly carve metal components. The ""Ghost Gunner"" takes away the need for advanced skill and creates untraceable weapons. The issue is far from academic. The Los Angeles Police Department last month showcased a trove of ""ghost"" weapons it recovered from gang members. Law enforcement cannot trace these weapons if they are used to commit crimes. That is why lawmakers, law enforcement personnel, gun control groups and even Trump himself expressed everything from panic to skepticism this week when Wilson started distributing blueprints online. Those blueprints included his company's own creation, the ""Liberator"" plastic gun -- a sidearm that resembles something seen on science fiction TV shows. The potential impact of Wilson's publication was worldwide. Any country with uncensored access to the internet could see its gun control measures circumvented with a click of a mouse. ""It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that 3D-printed guns are nothing short of a menace to society,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one,"" Gardiner said after the injunction. Wilson also plans to fight, just as he unsuccessfully fought in the courts for five years. The judge that ordered his website shut plans to hold a hearing on the states' lawsuit next week. Wilson put out a call for donations to fund the legal challenge, but is aware that he may be facing a losing battle. ""I believe that duty demands that I continue to fight it,"" he said, while admitting that ""I think I'll waste a lot of money.""",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distortion, at the company’s headquarters in Austin, Tex.","Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide.

No time to be making fun of people.” The Pittsburgh shooting marked the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.

380,380,169,https://www.newsweek.com/guns-crime-and-freedom-nra-book-turned-stephen-miller-conservative-1071753,"Guns, Crime and Freedom': The NRA Book That Turned a Young Stephen Miller Into a Conservative","White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller has faced widespread backlash over his hardline views on immigration, but on Monday a member of his own family emerged as one of his strongest critics. In a scathing editorial published by Politico, Miller's uncle, David Glosser, said he was horrified by his ""immigration hypocrite"" nephew, asserting that if his nephew's ""ideas on immigration had been in force a century ago,"" his own ""family would have been wiped out."" Despite Miller's ancestors coming to the U.S. in search of safety after fleeing ""violent anti-Jewish pogroms"" in what is now known as Belarus, the senior adviser has led a seemingly merciless campaign to push for policies restricting immigration to the country. But that is not the only way the politician's hardline views belie his family's roots, with the conservative senior adviser born into a liberal family of Democrats in Santa Monica, California. According to Politico, Miller veered from the path of his Democrat parents at an early age after a copy of National Rifle Association CEO Wayne LaPierre's 1994 book, Guns, Crime and Freedom, fell into his hands. 'Guns, Crime and Freedom' The 263-page book is mainly focused on dismantling arguments in support of gun control, including those in favor of assault weapon bans. However, it also attacks a broad range of other progressive ideas, including welfare and criminal justice reform. ""Guns, Crime, and Freedom has all the facts,"" the book's jacket states. ""It explores the issues of gun control, crime, and the Second Amendment, and provides documented evidence and telling statements about the agenda of those who want to ban guns."" Later in the book, LaPierre wrote: ""This is about freedom. Not crime, not hunting, not recreation. Freedom. And people don't want to lose it,"" adding that people were ""totally fed up"" with ""misreporting"" on the gun control debate in the national media. A 1994 article on the tome, written by David Steitfeld for The Washington Post, suggests that ""once you know the book was written by Wayne LaPierre, the head of the National Rifle Association, you can easily guess its message."" However, Steitfeld noted that what one couldn't have guessed was how popular the message would become, with Guns, Crime and Freedom becoming D.C.-based Regnery Publishing's ""biggest success in the publisher's 47-year history,"" with HarperCollins buying paperback rights for a ""six-figure sum."" Among those propelling the book to a coveted spot on The New York Times' bestseller list was a young Stephen Miller. The ideas espoused in the tome reportedly provided the framework for a belief system on immigration that appeared to be in the early stages of formation in a column Miller wrote for a Christian publication shortly after graduating from Santa Monica High School. In the March 2006 column, titled, ""My Dream for the End of Racism,"" a teenage Miller called for universal equality for ""all men, all women, all races [and] all creeds."" Miller wrote of how ""overjoyed"" he felt to be living ""in a country where anyone who wishes to succeed may do so, given sufficient drive, devotion and commitment."" However, the then-17-year-old appeared to later suggest in the piece that the best ""prescription for the disease of racism"" was to bring people in the U.S. together, in an apparent push for cultural homogeneity. ""We should stress the one culture that we all hold in common—the American culture,"" Miller wrote. ""There is so much to share and to be proud of in our nation's glorious history,"" he continued. ""There must be more American celebrations, more patriotic exercises, more focus on America and why our ancestors came here, more study of this nation's valiant efforts at fighting for freedom around the world, more reminders of what is great about this country,"" the then-high school graduate said. A former high school classmate of Miller's told the New York Times that the then-teenager would hit out at Spanish-speaking students for speaking anything other than English in the school halls. ""He tended to make some of the Spanish language stuff very personal,"" Moises Castillo told the newspaper. ""There was a 'if you're not speaking English, perhaps you should go somewhere else,"" the former classmate said. The senior adviser's teenage views could provide some insight into his hardline stance today, which has seen Miller push for a policy that would have legal immigrants penalized for using support programs, such as food stamps, by making it more difficult for them to become citizens or obtain green card status.

Glosser said he could not help but ""shudder"" at the thought of what would have happened to his ancestors had the same policies his nephew ""espouses—the travel ban, the radical decrease in refugees, the separation of children from their parents and even talk of limiting citizenship for legal immigrants—been in effect when Wolf-Leib made his desperate bid for freedom. ""Acting for so long in the theater of right-wing politics,"" Glosser said that ""Stephen and Trump may have become numb to the resultant human tragedy and blind to the hypocrisy of their policy decisions."" He said that while ""immigration reform is a complex issue"" any government intent on making ""policy that specifically disadvantages people based on their ethnicity, country of origin and religion…must be recognized as a threat to all of us.""",Stephen Miller The White House Presidency of Donald Trump President of the United States 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown United States Secretary of Homeland Security Senior advisor Immigration policy of Donald Trump Senior Advisor to the President of the United States Democratic Party,"Stephen Miller, the president of the National Rifle Association, in an image from a video on the website of the National Rifle Association in December.","White House Senior Adviser Stephen Miller has faced widespread backlash over his hardline views on immigration, but on Monday a member of his own family emerged as one of his strongest critics.

847,847,110044,http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-everett-gun-background-checks-20181127-story.html,Pro-gun control voters swept Democrats into power. Nancy Pelosi shouldn't give them half measures,"Many Americans are hopeful that come January the newly elected Democratic majority in the House will work to keep guns out of the hands of potential mass shooters. Early signals on this front, however, give little cause for optimism. Two days after the midterm election Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive speaker, said House Democrats will prioritize “bipartisan legislation to have common-sense background checks” on firearm sales. The legislation she’s referring to is the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act, which would expand the existing background check system for gun buyers. This is not universal background check legislation; it would just cover private sales that are commercially advertised, such as at gun shows, over the internet or through classified ads. Worse, the bill includes National Rifle Association-drafted language that bars the federal government from registering privately held firearms. Given the overwhelming success of Democratic congressional candidates who championed gun control in the midterm elections, this feels like a weak lead for Pelosi and her caucus. The bill also suffers from a fundamental flaw: It relies on a system replete with dangerous loopholes. Since being instituted in 1998, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) has consistently failed to block gun sales to individuals with a history of violence. An FBI study of 63 mass shooting cases between 2000 and 2013 found that only 2% of the guns used were purchased illegally, and 6% were stolen. By comparison, 40% of the guns were purchased legally — meaning the buyer passed a background check — by people intending to use them in the attack they were planning. (Another 35% of guns were already owned by the attacker.) Advertisement Pelosi would be smart to keep Democrats’ pro-gun-control base energized and mobilized through the 2020 election. At the same time, the FBI found that mass shooters displayed, on average, four or more “concerning behaviors” that had been noticed by others. These behaviors included symptoms of mental illness, impulsivity, physical aggression, reckless behavior with firearms and discussion of threats. The NRA would love to stick with the instant check system, which it designed with all its failings more than 25 years ago. The original Brady Bill, passed after the attempted assassination of President Reagan, called for a waiting period on handgun purchases during which state or local law enforcement officials would conduct a background investigation into the buyer. These investigations didn’t rely on computerized criminal and mental health records, which few states had at the time. Under the interim provisions of the Brady Law from 1994 to 1998, law enforcement officers researched the histories of gun buyers by talking to families, medical professionals, courts, psychiatric institutions, and other law enforcement officers. That changed in 1998 when, thanks to the NRA’s allies in Congress, these multi-day investigations were replaced by the instant check system. The NICS process prioritizes speed over thoroughness and public safety. Here’s how it works: Federally licensed firearms dealers contact an FBI call center in Clarksburg, W.Va., and provide the name, race, gender and date of birth of a prospective gun buyer. The FBI checks three separate computer databases for past criminal offenses or involuntary commitments to psychiatric institutions. The agency then responds with one of three commands: approve, deny or delay. Within two minutes, 92% of NICS checks are completed. Advertisement Federal law also allows many people with a record of violent crime to buy guns, including those with misdemeanor convictions for assault or battery, sex offenses and stalking; and domestic abusers who have been subject to past restraining orders but currently are not. Additionally, NICS allows individuals in crisis to buy guns, including dangerously mentally ill individuals with prior voluntary commitments and many alcohol and substance abusers. Gun sales to such individuals benefit only the bottom line of the gun industry. Enter the Fray: First takes on the news of the minute from L.A. Times Opinion » The gun lobby’s contribution to the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act — a ban on national firearms registration — is telling. The NRA knows that requiring a license to buy a gun and registration to keep one — with the training, testing and background investigation that would entail — is the most effective way to keep firearms out of the hands of violent individuals. In other democracies, this typically results in significantly lower rates of gun death and overall homicide than the U.S. Likewise, a just-published study from researchers at UC Davis and the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research concluded that a universal instant check system implemented in California did less to reduce homicide and suicide rates in the state than “permit-to-purchase” (licensing) laws in Connecticut and Missouri. Why? Because permit-to-purchase laws require gun buyers to deal directly with law enforcement agencies in their communities. For too long, Democrats have been manipulated into promoting the NRA’s failed computerized screening process for gun buyers in the name of “bipartisanship.” Pelosi would be smart to keep Democrats’ pro-gun-control base energized and mobilized through the 2020 election. That can’t be accomplished with half-baked, meek legislation. If Pelosi can’t see that gun control is a winning issue, House Democrats should replace her with someone who does and is ready to go big. Advertisement Republicans in the Senate and White House are highly unlikely to act on whatever gun control legislation is ultimately passed by the Democratic House—no matter how modest. So shouldn’t Democrats set out to craft a policy that, one day, can actually achieve the goal of disarming violent people in America?

37,37,90014,https://www.yahoo.com/news/cruz-biological-mothers-past-factor-school-shooting-165703886.html,Cruz biological mother's past a factor in school shooting,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The extensive criminal and drug abuse history of Parkland school suspect Nikolas Cruz's biological mother could be a key factor in whether he is sentenced to die for the massacre that killed 17 people, legal experts and officials say. The mother, 62-year-old Brenda Woodard, played no role in Cruz's upbringing after giving him up for adoption after he was born. But her past, which included a crack cocaine purchase arrest while she was pregnant with Cruz, will almost certainly be brought up for a jury considering whether he should live or die. ""It is not necessarily her past, but how her past contributed to his genetic makeup,"" said David S. Weinstein, a former state and federal prosecutor now in private practice. ""Her use of drugs and alcohol while she was pregnant with him, and how her genetic makeup was passed on to him."" ""It might not carry the day, but it will give the jurors another mitigating factor to consider,"" he added. The identity of Woodard, first reported Wednesday by the Miami Herald, was confirmed to the Associated Press by a person close to the case who spoke on condition of anonymity because it is an ongoing prosecution. The American Bar Association guidelines for defense lawyers in death penalty cases say they should closely examine all the defendant's past family, going back at least three generations. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, the chairman of a state commission investigating the shooting separate from the prosecution, said Wednesday that all of Cruz's background is relevant. ""If information has come to light about his biological mother and there is some relevance there, of course we will take a look at it,"" Gualtieri said. ""We are looking heavily at his background and his whole life."" Cruz, 19, is charged with 17 counts of murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the Feb. 14 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. His lawyers say he will plead guilty if spared the death penalty, but prosecutors have refused that offer. Story continues Broward County Public Defender Howard Finkelstein declined Wednesday to discuss how Woodard's past might become part of the case. But he repeated that Cruz is ready to end it now. ""Lock him up forever. Throw away the key and never speak his name,"" Finkelstein said in an email. ""Maybe it will curtail some of the pain and hurt that certainly will happen if this case continues on a decades-long march to death."" If the case goes to the death penalty phase, all 12 jurors must agree on capital punishment or Cruz will get an automatic life prison sentence. Cruz and his brother, Zachary, were both adopted by Roger and Lynda Cruz soon after Woodard gave birth to them. Roger Cruz died when Nikolas Cruz was a young child and Lynda Cruz died last November, just a few months before the Parkland shooting. Nikolas Cruz had numerous behavioral and learning problems throughout his life, along with a fascination with guns and his own problems with alcohol and drug abuse. Court and prison records show that Woodard was arrested more than two dozen times from the 1980s through the 2000s for crimes including drug offenses, car theft, weapons possession, burglary, domestic violence and battery charges. She served a variety of prison sentences over those decades, including one 18-month stretch for car theft and fleeing from a law enforcement officer. Woodard was charged in 2010 with using a tire iron to beat someone she shared an apartment with in a senior living complex. Her last arrest was in 2011, records show. Woodard did not immediately respond Wednesday to a message left on her cellphone. Cruz's half-sister and Woodard's daughter, Danielle Woodard, has had her own extensive brushes with the law and is currently imprisoned as a habitual offender, Corrections Department records show. Her most recent convictions include attempted second-degree murder, cocaine possession, battery on and fleeing from a law enforcement officer and credit card fraud. She is scheduled for release in 2020. _____ Associated Press writer Terry Spencer in Sunrise, Florida, contributed to this story. _____ Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt",Nikolas Cruz Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Parkland Fort Lauderdale School shooting Shooting Suspect Broward County Sheriff's Office School Murder,"Nikolas Cruz in court in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., in February.","FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

Casey L. Jones, aged 30, is accused of firing more than a dozen shots into the ceiling and walls of the room. At least one of the rounds hit a residence across the street while a family of three was at home, the Knoxville News Sentinel first reported, citing an arrest warrant. There were no injuries in the incident, but Jones was charged with four counts of reckless endangerment involving a deadly weapon. He was arrested and released on $8,000 bond. The incident was reported at just after 1:30 a.m. Wednesday in North Knox County. The home is on the 5100 block of Magic Lantern Drive. A woman who was in the residence at the time reportedly told police officers that there had been no trouble prior to the shots. The arrest warrant stated: ""She stated that no argument had taken place, but the arrestee was playing Xbox when he suddenly had a breaking point and began screaming at the game. He smashed the gaming console with his fist, causing him to act out in more rage. ""The victim then told officers [Jones] went upstairs to the bedroom and began firing rounds through the ceiling and walls, but never pointed the firearm at her. The arrestee made threats of harming himself and has a history of making those same threats, according to the victim."" The woman in the home was not named by the sheriff's department. According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, citing the warrant, police found 16 shell casings in the bedroom. The news outlet reported that Jones admitted to investigators that he had used a Springfield XDS handgun to fire some bullets into the ceiling. He then used a separate gun—a Springfield XDM—and fired more bullets into the surrounding walls. One of those bullets flew through a window and struck the family home. Two weapons were seized by law enforcement. It remains unknown what game Jones was playing. He will appear in court on November 14. In September, a New York man was arrested after allegedly threatening to kill an 11-year-old boy who beat him at Fortnite, an online multiplayer game in the battle royale genre. Michael Aliperti, 45, of Long Island, was detained by Suffolk County Police after allegedly telling the child he ""would cause him pain [and] that he would find him with a gun."" The man allegedly made threats via text and voice chat. He was charged with second-degree aggravated harassment and acting in a manner to injure a child, police said at the time. There is no scientific consensus on the links between video gaming and real-world violence. One report this year, which brought together the findings of 24 studies, suggested that violent games may lead to a ""small increase in physical aggression among adolescents and preteens,"" reported Scientific American.

The plan to allow states to allocate federal funding for firearms, which was reported earlier this week, would break a longstanding federal government precedent of not paying for weapons in schools. “We knew Betsy DeVos wanted to gut and privatize public education, but her decision to consider turning the federal government into an arms dealer for schools goes far beyond the recklessness we thought she was capable of. Flooding schools with guns will make kids and teachers less, not more, safe,” Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said. “Secretary DeVos’s proposal is not only flatly absurd, but is likely illegal. Congress mandated that federal monies be used to advance student learning not purchase weaponry for teachers,” Corey Ciorciari, policy and strategy director for Democracy Forward, added.

Anthony Portantino pointed to the shooting at a Florida high school earlier this year that killed 17 people as the reason for his bill banning gun sales and transfers to people under 21. """"I was determined to help California respond appropriately to the tragic events our country has recently faced on high school campuses,"""" Portantino said in a statement. """"I feel it is imperative that California leads when Washington refuses to act."""" Brown also signed a bill to prohibit gun ownership for people who have been hospitalized or otherwise placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold for risk of hurting themselves or others twice in one year. That law would let those people ask a court every five years to return their guns. He also signed a bill to ban people with certain domestic violence misdemeanors from owning guns for life. In addition to the gun-related bills, he vetoed a measure that would have let bars in some cities serve alcohol until 4 a.m., which he said would result in more drunken driving.

1225,1225,90168,http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-immigrants-border-american-guns-20180930-story.html,"As immigrants flow across the U.S. border, American guns go south","Among the thousands of immigrants who have been coming across the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months, many are seeking to escape gang and drug violence raging in their homelands. The weapon of choice used to intimidate them? Often an American-made gun. While the flow of drugs and immigrants into the U.S. has been well-documented for decades and become a regular part of the political debate, what is often overlooked is how gangs and drug cartels exploit weaknesses at the border to smuggle guns from the U.S. into Latin America. A 2013 report by the University of San Diego says the number of firearms smuggled from the United States was so significant that nearly half of American gun dealers rely on that business to stay afloat. On average, an estimated 253,000 firearms each year are purchased in the United States expressly to be sent to Mexico, the report said, the vast majority of the sales originating in the border states of California, Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. Once in Mexico, the weapons end up in the hands of drug cartels or get shipped to gangs in Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — countries that are dealing with an epidemic of gun violence. Armed holdups on public transportation are a regular occurrence in Honduras, where nearly half of the unregistered weapons originated in the U.S., the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported in recent years. Gun violence in El Salvador is so rampant that the country has been averaging more than one shootout a day between police and gangs this year, said Ricardo Sosa, a criminologist specializing in gangs and security in El Salvador. ""In every one of these operations, police are able to seize between two and six firearms at the scene,"" he said. ""That is one of the indicators that the gangs are armed on many occasions with long guns and short guns for each one of their members."" Mexico last year recorded its highest number of murders in nearly two decades, with more than 31,000 people killed, higher than even during the country's drug war in 2011. It continues unabated with an average of 88 people killed each day in the first five months of this year. The bloodshed in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador has been a big driver of immigration into the U.S., with the government saying nearly 16,000 families came across the border in August alone — many of them from those three countries. Gun-control groups contend that the U.S. government is essentially exporting gang violence to Latin America with permissive gun laws — which in turn creates an immigration crisis along the border. ""If the Trump administration were serious about wanting to stop refugees from fleeing violence in Latin America and Mexico to come north, they would be doing something about the southward gun trafficking that is fueling a lot of that migration,"" said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel with the Giffords Law Center. Gun-rights activists say the issue is overblown and mischaracterized. The National Rifle Association and other gun-rights groups contend the most effective way to combat the problem is not with stricter gun laws but by eradicating drug cartels and other criminal enterprises. They say the numbers are inflated and that the industry has proactively sought to educate licensed gun dealers on how to detect ""straw purchases,"" in which a firearm is bought expressly to give it to someone who otherwise would not be able to legally own a gun. ""Obviously, Mexico has a huge problem with rampant corruption that clearly cannot be blamed on the U.S.,"" the NRA said in a position paper on the issue in 2009. ""At the same time, Mexico has extremely prohibitive gun laws, yet has far worse crime than the U.S."" Under the Obama administration, federal authorities launched an operation dubbed Fast and Furious that allowed criminals to buy firearms with the intention of tracking them to criminal organizations. But the ATF lost most of the guns, including two that were found at the scene of a slaying of a U.S. Border Patrol agent. In 2011, gun dealers along the border states were required to report to the ATF anytime someone purchased two or more semiautomatic long guns in a five-day period. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in 2017 as his response to gun trafficking, directing federal agencies to ramp up prosecution aimed at going after foreign criminals and to improve coordination among federal agencies along the border. Nabbing the guns at the border is a challenge on several levels. They aren't as detectable as drug shipments, and they can be disassembled and loaded with legal goods making their way from the U.S. ""The effectiveness of this kind of gun smuggling still remains very high. It doesn't take a whole lot,"" said David Shirk, one of the University of San Diego report's authors. Experts say a big reason gun trafficking remains one of the hot commodities flowing from the United States into Latin America is profit. Retired ATF agent Bernard Zapor noted that an AR-platform firearm that sells retail in the U.S. for $1,000 can fetch more than $4,000 in Mexico. A box of ammo that might go for just under $200 could command $3,000. ""They're not buying grandpa's old shotgun that's been lying around and found in a shed,"" Zapor said. ""They're buying brand new Colt AR-15s.""

Superintendent Dr. Jaqueline A. Rattigan announced the students would serve the detentions on Saturday. In a statement issued Wednesday, Rattigan said that around 225 students, including some who were accompanied by their parents, walked out of school as a part of a national movement orchestrated by students. The students opted to participate in the national walkout instead of attending an in-school assembly to remember the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida. According to The Morning Call , Pennridge had notified parents Tuesday that the high school would be holding the remembrance assembly, which included 17 minutes of silence as well as a power point presentation of the 17 victims killed by alleged gunman Nikolas Cruz. The letter also warned parents that any students who left school for the walkout would be doing so without permission and would """"receive the consequences which would normally apply in such circumstances.' Rattigan said students who were accompanied by their parents would be allowed to leave and would not face punishment. District public relations coordinator Joe Ferry told Newsweek that five students who walked out later went to Dunkin’ Donuts and will face additional detention. Anna Sophie Tinneny, a 17-year-old senior at Pennridge, told Newsweek that students whose parents could not sign them out were given a Saturday morning detention. The school did not accept written notes or emails from parents, she said. Tinneny said that while her parents are 'not completely in agreement with the reasons for the walkout' they are supportive. She said her mother went with her to the school board meeting in an attempt to convince the school board to allow students to walk out. 'I felt that it’s my responsibility to show my school community and Congress that gun control is an issue that I care about and that I’m willing to sacrifice for it,' she told Newsweek. 'I also wanted to show support to the Parkland students who have publicized the walkout.' Pennridge High School student who participated in the walkout were met by police and administrators when they reentered the building and were ordered to sign up for detention on March 14, 2018. Vinny Polignano courtesy of Anna Tinneny She said students returning to the school building were met with """"barricades"""" manned by police and administrators who had them sign up for detention before being allowed back into class. Ferry, however, told Newsweek the set up was in place to allow students to quickly return to class. """"There were still police in the building when students returned as they had been during the assembly to ensure safety of all students and staff,"""" he added. Tinneny called the detentions an 'inconvenience' but said she knew it was the consequence of walking out. 'Since the detention is going to be full dozens of students from the walkout, we’re planning on another show of support for the movement by wearing signs with the names of the victims on it,' she said. Tinneny told Newsweek that she and some friends who planned the Pennridge walkout are going to D.C. to take part in the March For Our Lives later this month. In a statement, Rattigan said approximately 800 students attended the assemblies at the high school to honor the victims of the February 14 shooting. 'It was a moving experience for those who participated,' she said. 'About 225 students, including a few who were accompanied by their parents, chose to walk out of school to hold their own activity.' """"Just to be clear, no student will be disciplined because they expressed any particular viewpoint or opinion,"""" Rattigan added. """"Rather, the disciplinary consequence will be given for willfully breaking a school rule about leaving the building without permission.""""""",2018 United States gun violence protests Pennridge School District Walkout School Student Protest Teacher  High school Middle school,"Students at Pennridge High School in Pennsylvania, which was criticized for its role in the walkout, on Wednesday.","""Pennsylvania High School Punishes More Than 200 Students for Participating in National Walkout Against Gun Violence By Nicole Rojas On 3/15/18 at 1:30 PM More than 200 students at Pennridge High School in Pennsylvania received detention after participating in Wednesday's national student walkout calling for an end to gun violence.

In this June 7, 2018 file photo Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission chair and Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri gestures as he speaks during a commission meeting in Sunrise, Fla. Guiltieri says he now believes trained, volunteer teachers should have access to guns so they can stop shooters who get past other safeguards. AP Photo/Wilfredo Lee, File Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, chairman of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, said he will ask the panel to recommend state law be changed so teachers who undergo background checks and extensive training will be allowed to have guns on campus as a last line of defense. It's a proposal that both the state teachers union and PTA oppose. Gualtieri told The Associated Press this week he long believed only law enforcement personnel should carry guns at school, but his position ""morphed"" after studying other shootings and watching security video of the Feb. 14 Stoneman Douglas attack, which left 14 students and three staff members dead. He said it ""gnaws"" at him that suspect Nikolas Cruz stopped firing five times to reload his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, but no teacher or other school employee could use those pauses to shoot Cruz. The athletic director and a coach, both unarmed, died trying to stop Cruz and at least one teacher minutes later would have had a clear shot. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Meanwhile, video shows the Broward County sheriff's deputy assigned to the school drew his gun but stayed outside. By the time other law enforcement arrived, the final fatal shots had been fired. ""We know from the history of these things that the majority are stopped by school personnel,"" Gualtieri said, pointing to shootings where the gunman was tackled or disarmed by a teacher or campus employee. ""People need to keep an open mind to it as the reality is that if someone else in that school had a gun it could have saved kids' lives."" After the shooting, Florida law was changed to allow school districts to train and arm employees other than teachers, including administrators, librarians and custodians. Teachers are barred unless they are former or current police officers, current members of the military or Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps instructors. Thirteen of the state's 67 countywide districts adopted the program, mostly in rural parts of the state. Currently, teachers in 28 states can carry firearms, according to the Crime Prevention Research Center, a conservative nonprofit organization. District approval is required in most states and restrictions and training requirements vary. Both the Florida Education Association, which is the state teachers union, and the Florida PTA oppose arming teachers, saying having more guns on campus will make schools more dangerous, not less. ""Teachers should not be acting as armed security guards. The majority of our members don't want to be armed — they know it would be impractical and dangerous,"" union spokeswoman Joni Branch said. Angie Gallo, the state PTA's legislation chair, said only law enforcement should carry guns on campus. ""Teachers need to teach,"" Gallo said. ""Their job is not to secure our schools. It is not to shoot at shooters."" Other members of Gualtieri's commission, including Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd, have expressed support for arming teachers, although it is unclear if a majority agrees. The 15 panel members appointed by Gov. Rick Scott and legislative leaders include law enforcement, education and mental health professionals, a legislator and the fathers of two slain students. The panel, which has been meeting periodically since April, must file its initial report to Scott, incoming Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Legislature by Jan. 1. It will consider proposals for adoption at its mid-December meeting. Other proposed recommendations include preventing outside attacks by limiting and staffing entrances; allowing all school employees to order a lockdown; improving campus communication systems; and tightening laws governing the assessment of students who may pose a threat. For law enforcement, the proposals include giving officers clear orders that they must confront active shooters, even if they are alone, and making sure first responders from different agencies have radios that can quickly be programmed to communicate with each other.

(AP Photo/Mark Thiessen)ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — An Alaska Republican and most senior member of the U.S. House argued against gun control by wondering how many Jewish people """"were put in the ovens"""" because they were not armed. U.S. Rep. Don Young, who has a history of off-the-cuff remarks that can draw criticism, made the comments at a meeting last week in the state capital of Juneau when responding to a question about what the federal government and cities can do to stop school shootings. """"How many millions of people were shot and killed because they were unarmed?"""" Young, 84, said at a meeting of the Alaska Municipal League, a lobbying group for local communities. """"Fifty million in Russia because their citizens weren't armed. How many Jews were put into the ovens because they were unarmed?"""" The comments were """"taken entirely out of context,"""" Young spokeswoman Murphy McCollough said in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday. """"He was referencing the fact that when Hitler confiscated firearms from Jewish Germans, those communities were less able to defend themselves,"""" she said. """"He was not implying that an armed Jewish population would have been able to prevent the horrors of the Holocaust, but his intended message is that disarming citizens can have detrimental consequences."""" The Anti-Defamation League denounced the remarks. """"It is mind-bending to suggest that personal firearms in the hands of the small number of Germany's Jews (about 214,000 remaining in Germany in 1938) could have stopped the totalitarian onslaught of Nazi Germany when the armies of Poland, France, Belgium and numerous other countries were overwhelmed by the Third Reich,"""" the Jewish civil rights group said in a statement Wednesday. The executive director of the Alaska Democratic Party said the comments show it's time for residents to vote out Young. The longtime lawmaker is rarely in danger of being unseated in the heavily Republican state. """"Don Young continues to show he is completely divorced from reality,"""" Jay Parmley said. Young wasn't the first House Republican to face criticism for comments made after 17 students were killed at a high school in Parkland, Florida. U.S. Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York said on a radio program last week that """"many"""" people who commit mass murder turn out to be Democrats, without offering evidence. Young's comments emerged when Dimitri Shein, a Democrat, posted video of the lawmaker's response to his question on YouTube. Young intimated the violent nature of video games might play a role in gun violence. A former schoolteacher, he said kids brought guns to schools 40 years ago """"and they didn't shoot anybody."""" """"Something's happened, it's easy to blame an object,"""" Young said. """"Why don't we look at the mental concept and the family structure"""" as he noted that he supports arming teachers. Young, who was first elected in 1973, ensures civility in the U.S. House after receiving a largely ceremonial title earlier this year that's given to the longest-serving member of the chamber. He has faced blowback for other remarks. A few years ago, he had to apologize for using a racial epithet when referring to Hispanic migrant workers and also backtracked when he said a female colleague """"doesn't know a damn thing what she's talking about."""" His staff had to apologize in 2014 after he spoke at an Alaska high school a day after a student's suicide. When asked what his office was doing to combat the state's high suicide rate, he stunned the audience by saying suicide showed a lack of support from family and friends.""",Don Young Republican Party United States Congress  Member of Parliament United States Senate Legislator Panis Angelicus Politician Sandi Patty,Representative Don Young of Alaska,"""The most senior member in the U.S. House has argued against gun control by wondering how many Jews """"were put in the ovens"""" during the Holocaust because they weren't armed.

The Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program does not specifically prohibit weapons purchases and would allow DeVos to decide which states or school districts could use the funding for guns and training, sources told The New York Times on Wednesday. The $1 billion student support program is intended to fund the country’s poorest schools, the newspaper noted, adding that funds are typically allocated toward improving education curriculum, school conditions or technology for digital literacy. ADVERTISEMENT The Education Department would likely approve the gun purchases under the goal of improving school conditions, the sources told the Times. Schools that would reportedly receive fund would be encouraged to increase mental health counseling, create dropout prevention programs and help students acclimate from the juvenile justice system. “The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,” Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, told the newspaper. “The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” The move would be a historic break of precedent from the longstanding federal government policy of not to paying for weapons inside schools, the newspaper noted. Congress passed a bipartisan school safety bill earlier this year that created a new grant program to help educate students and teachers about warning signs for gun violence.

So is the hospital’s president, Jeffrey Cohen, who visited Bowers in his recovery room. “Isn’t it ironic that somebody who is yelling in the ambulance and in the hospital, ‘I want to kill all the Jews,’ is taken care of by a Jewish nurse and there’s a Jewish hospital president that comes in to check on him afterwards?” Cohen told CNN. Cohen lives across the street from the Tree of Life, where he is a longtime member, and has deep personal connections with the synagogue. According to Tribune-Review, his mother-in-law attends services “nearly every day.” He knew nine of the people who were killed. Nonetheless, Cohen and his team treated Bowers as they would any other patient. “We’re here to take care of sick people, we’re not here to judge you,” Cohen said in an interview with a Pittsburgh TV station. “We’re here to take care of people that need our help.” The young nurse who immediately attended to Bowers broke down in tears shortly after the treatment. “The nurse that took care of him, his father is a rabbi in the South Hills,” Cohen told the Pittsburgh Business Times. “He told me he went home that night to his parents’ house and hugged his parents, and I told him that his parents raised a really good kid.” At one point, Cohen personally checked in with Bowers to ask him how we was doing. “[Bowers] asked me who I was, I said ‘I’m Dr. Cohen, the president of the hospital,’ ” Cohen told CNN. “And I turned around and left. And the FBI agent that was guarding him said, ‘I don’t know that I could have done that.’ I said, ‘If you were in my shoes, I’m sure you could’ve.’ ” Bowers was discharged from Allegheny General Hospital on Monday morning and appeared in court in a wheelchair to hear the charges against him: 29 federal counts of hate crimes, violence, and firearm offenses.

The Spanish-language ad criticizes Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum’s agenda, saying it will result in “abusive taxes,” “excessive government,” “choking bureaucracy and parents losing control over the education of their children.” Several photos of Gillum are used throughout the 30-second ad, but one in particular caused the ire of a survivor of the mass shooting attack on the Orlando Pulse nightclub in 2016 that left 49 people dead. In the photo, Gillum is looking down at a commemorative ribbon for those who lost their lives in the tragedy. Brandon Wolf, a survivor of the attack, told those on a press call organized by Democrats he’s “sick of Republicans using Pulse as some political prop after they turned their back on that community for so long,” the Tampa Bay Times reported. “I am really sick of desperate political serpents like [GOP nominee] Ron DeSantis who will quite literally say anything and do anything to win elections,” Wolf said. “I am really really sick of the memory of 49 lives constantly being trampled on.” COLORADO SCHOOL SHOOTING VICTIM’S FATHER ACCUSES GIFFORDS SUPER PAC AD OF ‘POLITICIZING’ DAUGHTER’S DEATH Geoff Burgan, an advisor to Gillum’s campaign, tweeted the Florida Republican Party “sunk to a new low” with the ad. By Tuesday afternoon, the ad was amended and a different photo of Gillum was used. “There was no intention to be insensitive in anyway,” Meredith Beatrice, a Florida GOP spokeswoman, told the Tampa Bay Times. “However, we stand by the message of the ad.” Last month, a pro-gun control super PAC agreed to change an ad after the father of a Colorado school shooting victim complained it was “politicizing” the death of his daughter. FOX NEWS MIDTERM ELECTION HEADQUARTERS The ad from the Giffords PAC criticized Rep. Mike Coffman, a Republican up for re-election, for his ties to the National Rifle Association. It featured text messages from “Emily” informing her mother a shooter was in her school. “I’m so scared. I love u. Tell Dad I love him,” the texts in the ad read. John-Michael Keyes said the ad was “problematic” because it seemed to mirror the tragedy his family endured. His daughter, Emily Keyes, was fatally shot in 2006 after a 53-year-old man took several female students hostage at Platte Canyon High School in Bailey, Colorado, and sexually assaulted them. She was 16 years old. Before her death, Keyes texted her family, “I love you guys” and “I love u guys, k?” The super PAC agreed to amend the ad to make it “clear that it is not connected to any one incident.” The Florida gubernatorial election is ranked a tossup by Fox News.

950,950,110274,http://www.yahoo.com/news/southern-california-city-mourns-wake-bar-massacre-070443860.html,Official: Shooter debated sanity online during bar massacre,"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- The gunman who killed 12 people at a country music bar in Southern California went on social media during the attack and posted about his mental state and whether people would believe he was sane, a law enforcement official said Friday. Also, one of the possibilities investigators are looking into is whether gunman Ian David Long believed his former girlfriend would be at the bar, the official said. Authorities have not determined a motive for Wednesday night's rampage at the Borderline Bar and Grill. The official was briefed on the investigation but not authorized to discuss it publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The official would not give additional details on what the 28-year-old former Marine posted on his Facebook and Instagram accounts. A second law enforcement official said that when Long was inside the bar, he apparently stopped shooting and posted to Instagram, based on the time stamps of the posts. Ventura County Sheriff's Capt. Garo Kuredjian also said he didn't know the content of the posts. Neither Facebook nor Instagram responded to a request for comment Friday. Long's social media accounts have been taken down. Long, a former machine gunner who served in Afghanistan, opened fire with a handgun during college night at the bar, then apparently killed himself as scores of police officers closed in. As investigators worked to figure out what set him off, President Donald Trump blamed mental illness, describing the gunman as ""a very sick puppy"" who had ""a lot of problems."" Investigators have not commented on whether mental illness played a role in the rampage. But a mental health specialist who assessed Long after sheriff's deputies responded to a call about his agitated behavior last spring worried he might be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. The incident happened in April, when yelling and loud banging noises coming from the home Long shared with his mother prompted a next-door neighbor to call authorities. The mental health specialist concluded there were no grounds to have him involuntarily committed. Story continues Several people who knew Long a decade ago as a high-schooler in the suburb of Thousand Oaks said in interviews that he made them uncomfortable, sometimes through aggressive behavior. At the White House, Trump touted his efforts to fund work on PTSD among veterans. He declined to engage on questions on whether the nation needs stricter gun control laws. The dead in the shooting rampage included sheriff's Sgt. Ron Helus, a 29-year veteran gunned down as he entered the bar, and Telemachus Orfanos, 27, who survived last year's massacre in Las Vegas, where a gunman in a high-rise hotel opened killed 58 people at an outdoor country music festival. Authorities in Thousand Oaks described an attack of military efficiency. None of those injured was hurt by gunfire, authorities said. Instead, when Long shot, he killed. ""Every Marine is trained in urban warfare and indoor gun fighting,"" said Marc Bender, an instructor for emergency responders in Riverside County, California. ""Every Marine is a marksman."" Julie Hanson, who lives next door to the Longs' ranch-style home, described him as ""odd"" and ""disrespectful"" well before he left home a decade ago, got married and enlisted in the Marines. She could often hear him yelling and cursing, but several months ago, unusually loud banging and shouting prompted her husband to call authorities. ""I was concerned because I knew he had been in the military,"" Tom Hanson said. About 18 months ago, Don and Effie MacLeod heard ""an awful argument"" and what he believes was a gunshot from the Longs' property. Don MacLeod said he did not call police but avoided speaking with Ian Long. ""I told my wife, 'Just be polite to him. If he talks, just acknowledge him, don't go into conversation with him,' "" Don MacLeod said. Long made others feel uncomfortable going back to his teens. Dominique Colell, who coached girls' track and field at the high school where Long was a sprinter, remembers an angry young man who could be verbally and physically combative. In one instance, Colell said Long used his fingers to mimic shooting her in the back of the head as she talked to another athlete. In another, he grabbed her rear and midsection after she refused to return a cellphone he said was his. ""I literally feared for myself around him,"" Colell said in an interview. ""He was the only athlete that I was scared of."" Colell said she wanted to kick Long off the team but the boy's coach urged her to reconsider because that could compromise his goal of joining the Marines. She relented when, at the next track meet, Long apologized in front of several coaches and administrators. Attempts to get comment by phone and in person from officials at Newbury Park High School and its school district were unsuccessful. Both were closed because of a destructive wildfire in the area. ___ Balsamo reported from Washington.

190,190,100460,http://us.cnn.com/2018/10/29/us/kroger-shooting-hate-crime/index.html,Kroger shooting in Kentucky is being investigated as a hate crime,"(CNN) The fatal shooting of two black people in a Kroger grocery store in Kentucky is being investigated as a hate crime, Jeffersontown Mayor Bill Dieruf told CNN on Monday. Gregory A. Bush, a white 51-year-old, is accused of killing Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vickie Jones, 67, last Wednesday inside the Jeffersontown grocery store and in the parking lot, respectively. Prior to the shooting, Bush allegedly tried to enter a predominantly black church nearby but was unable to get inside, officials said. When that attempt failed, he went to Kroger instead and opened fire in the store. Dieruf also said investigators are looking into reports that Bush told a bystander before he was captured that ""whites don't shoot whites."" Given that, Dieruf said, the shooting ""appears as if it is"" a hate crime. ""We have to get this all in line. The U.S. Attorney is reviewing the case, as are ATF and the FBI,"" the mayor said. ""A crime against race is something that we will not accept. If it's a hate crime, it's unacceptable to us that a crime would be committed against a race -- certainly against any nationality or race is heinous."" Heather Hogue, the spokeswoman for the Jeffersontown Police Department, confirmed that police Chief Sam Rogers believes the shooting ""appears to be motivated by hate."" She also said any charges related to hate crimes would be federal charges and separate from the state charges against Bush. Members of the Louisville Metro Police Department talk inside a Kroger grocery in Jeffersontown, Kentucky following a shooting on Oct. 24, 2018. Bush exchanged multiple rounds of gunfire in the Kroger parking lot with an armed civilian who had a carry concealed permit, police said. Nobody was injured, and the suspect fled the scene and then was arrested nearby, authorities said. He was arraigned last Thursday on two counts of murder and 10 counts of wanton endangerment and is being held on $5 million bond, according to CNN affiliate WAVE. The difficulty of hate crime charges Although Bush does not face hate crime charges at this time, several officials have said they believe the crimes may fit that definition. Hate crimes are defined by the FBI as a traditional criminal offense but with an added element of bias. Russell M. Coleman, the US attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, said in a statement that federal investigators are ""supporting local law enforcement and examining this matter from the perspective of federal criminal law, which includes potential civil rights violations such as hate crimes."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who represents Kentucky, said he believed that the Kroger shooting and the mass shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday were both hate crimes. ""We witnessed, all of us, two horrendous shootings this weekend. One in a synagogue in Pittsburgh and one in a Kroger's store in Louisville,"" McConnell said. ""If these aren't definitions of hate crimes, I don't know what a hate crime is. And I know that's a legal determination that's going to be made by others but that certainly is my opinion."" CNN law enforcement analyst James Gagliano said that the Pittsburgh shooter's anti-Semitic remarks to police at the scene made connecting the dots fairly easy for hate crimes charges. In general, though, officials act in an abundance of caution before applying hate crimes charges because it requires officials to prove their motivation. ""It's trying to intuit intent,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult thing sometimes."" Still, he said he believed the Kroger shooting investigation would move in that direction in the near future. ""Does there appear to be enough there that you could charge this as a federal hate crime? I think the answer yes,"" he said. ""It just hasn't happened yet. But that doesn't mean it's not going to happen."" There were a total of 6,121 hate crime incidents in 2016, including nine hate crime murders , according to FBI statistics. However, some legal experts say that the FBI data is undercounted because the hate crime reports are provided voluntarily, and not every police department participates. Mayor visits targeted church Surveillance video showed that 10 to 15 minutes before the grocery store shooting, Bush tried to enter the First Baptist Church in Jeffersontown, Chief Rogers said. A church member sitting in the parking lot saw the suspect banging on and pulling the door, trying to get inside, CNN affiliate WDRB reported ""To think that an hour and a half earlier, we had 70 people in the church,"" church administrator Billy Williams told WDRB. ""But by the time he came through, all doors were locked, and there were probably eight or 10 still in the building."" In the wake of that threat, Mayor Dieruf said he attended the First Baptist Church on Sunday and spoke with parishioners. ""I told them in church, there's no reason we can't be the beacon that changes the world,"" Dieruf said. ""They get it. When you walk in and sit down, people shake your hand and hug and thank you for being there. They haven't gotten the fear of not welcoming people -- they welcome everybody. ""Five days after an incident like this, of a person probably trying to break in, that's what we have to do on a national basis. We've got to get back to where we feel safe and where we feel welcome,"" he said.",Maurice Stallard Jeffersontown Kroger shooting Jeffersontown  Kroger Louisville Shooting Hate crime Murder Suspect,"The shooting victim, Vickie Jones, 67, was shot and killed last week.","(CNN) The fatal shooting of two black people in a Kroger grocery store in Kentucky is being investigated as a hate crime, Jeffersontown Mayor Bill Dieruf told CNN on Monday.

During the program's “Unplugged” segment, Noah addressed the recent shooting at a mall in Hoover, Ala. that left one dead and two wounded on Thanksgiving night. The person killed by police, 21-year-old black Army veteran Emantic Bradford Jr., who was legally carrying a gun, was mistaken for the shooter and the real shooter could still be at large. “The question I ask myself is how does this s**t keep happening? Cops are called into a situation, they see a black person, and then immediately they shoot,” Noah told his audience. “That’s what they did here. They ran in, they shot the guy, and then they were like ‘We got him.’” ""How many times have we seen a shooter who is white and a man get talked down?” he asked, citing the shooters in Aurora and Charleston. While noting other shooters have killed themselves, Noah said when it comes to black men, it’s “shoot immediately” and “ask questions later.” 'If you’re a black man, you have no business bearing arms at all' — Trevor Noah “There are so many things that bug me about this story. Because by the looks of it, it sounds like this was a good guy with a gun. That’s what they always say, a ‘good guy with a gun stops the crime,’” Noah continued. “But if the good guy with a gun happens to be a black good guy with a gun, they don’t get any of the benefits.” The late-night comedian slammed the Hoover Police Department for their statement declaring they got the shooter, a statement they later apologized for, and how multiple people had reportedly pulled out their guns but that the “only person who was shot by police was a black guy.” Trevor Noah: Trump's 'superhuman stupidity' led president to discount his own administration's climate report “At this point, you start to realize that really the Second Amendment is not intended for black people,” Noah said. “It’s an uncomfortable thing to say, but it’s the truth. Like people will be like ‘the right to bear arms.’ Yes, the right to bear arms if you’re not a black man. If you’re a black man, you have no business bearing arms at all."" The “Daily Show” host also cited a recent incident involving a black security guard who was shot and killed after being mistaken for an armed assailant. “If you’re black and you’re a man in America, gun rights are not for you,” Noah reiterated. “If you’re a black person in America, gun rights are not for you. It’s as simple as that. In fact, the safest way to sell a black person a gun in America is to say that when you buy a gun you should buy a white person with it and they hold the gun for you.” “Some bulls**t, but it’s the truth,” he added. “Second Amendment was not made for black folks. “",The Daily Show Trevor Noah Television presenter Late-night talk show Late night television Comedian Television Television show Comedy Central,"Trevor Noah said that when the Second Amendment was not intended for black people, it’s not intended for black people.","The “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah got serious Tuesday night on the subjects of guns, police and race.

23,23,7,http://us.cnn.com/2018/08/14/us/florida-stand-your-ground-previous-incidents/index.html,Florida man threatened people 3 different times before shooting man in 'stand your ground' case,"(CNN) The man charged with manslaughter after shooting another man in a Clearwater, Florida, convenience store parking lot has a history of threatening drivers, according to documents from the Pinellas County Circuit Court. Michael Drejka, 47, fatally shot Markeis McGlockton in July after McGlockton shoved him to the ground during a dispute over a handicapped-accessible spot. Drejka claimed he feared for his life and said he fired in self-defense. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri previously said Florida's ""stand your ground"" laws prevented him from arresting Drejka. Drejka was ultimately charged and will make his first appearance in court Tuesday afternoon. CNN has tried contacting Drejka multiple times, but has not heard back and it was not clear whether he has an attorney. Court documents show that the July incident wasn't the first time Drejka aggressively confronted drivers over parking spots or what he perceived to be traffic infractions. In one incident, he caused a traffic accident by ""brake checking"" a car behind him, according to reports. A truck driver parked in a handicapped-accessible spot About three months ago, Richard Kelly told a Pinellas County Sheriff's Office detective he was confronted by Drejka at Circle A Food Store, the same store where he shot McGlockton. Drejka, documents said, was upset because Kelly parked in a handicapped-accessible spot. The exchange between the two became very loud and Kelly said at some point during the argument Drejka told him he was going to shoot him, documents said. Drejka then went to his car and was rummaging around the center console, but documents said Kelly drove away. Drejka, Kelly said, also threw racial slurs at him. Kelly is black and Drejka is white. Court documents said Drejka wanted to voice his complaint to Kelly's employer, AA Cut-Rate Septic Tank Service, so he spoke to the owner, John Tyler. Drejka told the business owner he was lucky he didn't blow his employee's head off, documents said. A woman drove too slow through a school zone On December 12, 2012, a woman told a Largo Police Department officer that a man driving a black Toyota truck, later identified as Drejka, pointed a gun at her and the passengers in the vehicle. The woman pointed out the truck to the officer. The officer spoke with Drejka, documents said, and he told the officer the woman was driving too slow through a school zone. Drejka denied pointing a gun at the occupants of the car, documents said, but he did have a gun in his vehicle. Drejka told the officer, according to police reports, that he honked at the people in the other car, and the people in that car made rude hand gestures at him. A teen didn't drive through a yellow light On January 10, 2012, Tyler Smith, 18, was driving with a friend when a traffic light turned yellow. Smith decided not to drive through the light and stopped his vehicle. A truck, driven by Drejka, was behind Smith. Drejka honked his horn, documents said, and yelled at Smith. Drejka held a black handgun out the driver's side window of his vehicle and motioned for Smith to walk back to his truck, documents said. Drejka then followed the teen's vehicle, passed it and slammed on his brakes, according to police reports . The teen did not press charges, documents said. When officers confronted Drejka about the incident, he said the teen's car cut him off, the police report said. He said he neither followed the teen's car nor did he show his gun, but did admit to having one in his vehicle. The 'brake-checking' incident Drejka was driving his truck down US Route 19 Alternate in Pinellas County on November 13, 2013, when a woman turned onto the route, pulling into the center lane so that Drejka could pass, according to a police report. She then pulled out behind Drejka. Drejka would later tell a state trooper that he felt the woman, who had her 4- and 7-year-old children in the car, almost hit him when she pulled into the center lane, the police report said. He began hitting his brakes ""in an aggressive manner,"" closing the distance between him and the woman, the report said. As she got closer, he again slammed his brakes aggressively and the woman rear-ended him, the report said. Drejka told police he was trying to turn into a store but missed the turn, the report said. But he also acknowledged being upset with the woman, according to the report, and said he was ""brake checking,"" a term for when you hit the brakes because another driver is riding your tail. ""Based on my training and experience and the damage to both vehicles, (Drejka) did not attempt to turn prior to the crash,"" the trooper wrote in the report, which said Drejka was cited for stopping or sudden decrease in speed without signaling.",Clearwater Shooting of Markeis McGlockton Stand-your-ground law  Pinellas County Sheriff's Office Sheriff Manslaughter Lawyer State's attorney Judge,"A memorial in Clearwater, Fla., where Markeis McGlockton was shot.","(CNN) The man charged with manslaughter after shooting another man in a Clearwater, Florida, convenience store parking lot has a history of threatening drivers, according to documents from the Pinellas County Circuit Court.

Adam Kraut, a gun rights lawyer, fell about 4,000 votes short of the 71,000 needed for election, but earned 5,000 more than the previous year, a sign of the growth of the Second Amendment purists within the NRA known to many as ""gundamentalists."" With opinion polls showing U.S. public support for more gun control growing in the wake of mass shootings in recent years, the NRA is facing internal pressure from this little-known force that is demanding that the leadership concede zero ground to gun-control advocates. Its rise has rattled the NRA leadership and threatens the association's ability to hold on to moderate supporters and to make compromises that might help fend off tougher gun control measures, according to some of the two dozen gun-rights activists, policy experts and gun-control advocates interviewed for this story. ""Generally, they have a disproportionately huge amount of power in the gun-rights movement,"" said Richard Feldman, a former NRA lobbyist. The NRA has faced divisions before. An internal revolt at the 1977 meeting in Cincinnati turned the polite, sport-shooting organization into a bare-knuckled political lobby that today claims five million members and is closely aligned with the Republican Party, funding pro-gun politicians. The NRA, which spent $30 million to support Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, is often viewed by gun-control advocates as implacably opposed to tighter gun laws. The NRA leadership has put up obstacles to Kraut's election, both with bylaws that make it harder for candidates not put forward by the nominating committee to get elected to the board, and by enlisting a senior member to campaign against him. Story continues Marion Hammer, a past president of the NRA and one of the group's most successful lobbyists, denounced unsanctioned candidates in a column on the website Ammoland just as Kraut appeared on the 2018 ballot. Though Hammer did not name Kraut, he was one of only two non-approved candidates to run. ""Once again the NRA is being threatened by the enemy within,"" Hammer wrote. ""It is time to wake up and stop it before it begins."" Neither the NRA nor Hammer responded to requests to address the influence of the gundamentalists and the criticism that these activists and other gun-rights groups directed at the lobby. SOCIAL MEDIA PRESSURE The Dallas protesters, almost all white men, included bearded outdoorsmen and buttoned-down libertarians. Some said they hid their T-shirts while entering the conventional hall for fear that NRA security would ban them. Kraut, 31, who says he grew up in a house without guns but as an adult taught his father how to shoot, practices firearms law in suburban Philadelphia and also hosts a video blog called The Legal Brief on The Gun Collective, a YouTube channel. He has campaigned for the NRA to push for even more expansive gun-rights laws. He wants to change NRA bylaws, such as imposing term limits for board members and mandatory meeting attendance, to renew its leadership. ""Some members feel it (the NRA) doesn't go far enough to defend what we believe to be the core of the Second Amendment,"" Kraut told Reuters. One of Kraut's most prominent supporters, Tim Harmsen, who led the pro-Kraut march through the convention center, has 770,000 subscribers to the Military Arms Channel on YouTube, where he criticizes the NRA for being weak on gun laws. ""We're going to continue to apply pressure (on the NRA) every way that we can through social media and we'll be there again next year,"" Harmsen said. These hardliners deeply cherish their right under the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment to keep and bear arms. They oppose any form of gun control, saying criminals will find ways around gun laws, which only strip lawful gun owners of the right to self-defense and protection against state tyranny. The gun-rights purists are outraged by any concessions the NRA makes in the wake of mass shootings, even if they are made to avoid stricter gun control laws. Opinion polls such as a regular Gallup survey show growing support for gun control in recent years. Within that trend, support for gun control typically spikes immediately after mass shootings, then falls closer to pre-massacre levels within a few months. After a shooter killed 58 people at a country music concert in Las Vegas last year, the NRA supported federal regulation of bump stocks, accessories that the gunman used to fire his semiautomatic rifles more quickly. The Justice Department then ordered an effective ban that is close to being finalized. Amid nationwide protests that followed a Florida high school shooting that killed 17 people in February, the NRA endorsed strengthening background checks for gun purchasers and emergency protection orders that allow law-enforcement officials to temporarily take guns away from people deemed dangerous. ""For us, some of the things that come out of NRA headquarters are just outrageous and abhorrent,"" said Jeff Knox, a Kraut supporter whose father, Neal Knox, led the ""Revolt at Cincinnati"" in 1977.

The suspect in a mass shooting that left two people dead and 12 with bullet wounds at a Madden 19 e-games tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, on Sunday, carried two handguns and extra ammunition into the contest venue and specifically targeted his competition, authorities said Monday. The two people killed in the shooting allegedly committed by David Katz, 24, inside a back room bar at a Chicago Pizza restaurant in the Jacksonville Landing mall were considered the top two Madden gamers in the world, a competitor wounded in the rampage told ABC News. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News ""The suspect clearly targeted other gamers that were in a back room at the Chicago Pizza participating in this gaming tournament,"" Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said of Katz at a news conference Monday afternoon. ""The suspect walked passed patrons who were in other parts of the business and focused his attention on the gamers."" Meanwhile, court records obtained by ABC News in Baltimore from a divorce and child custody battle between Katz's parents show that Katz was treated in 2011 for mental health issues and that his mother informed the court that her son was suffering from depression and ""affective disorders."" Records also show that David Katz was once prescribed the antidepressants Risperdal and Fluoxetine. David Katz seen here at a previous video game tournament ABC News Sheriff Williams said Katz was armed with two handguns, a .45-caliber and a 9mm, one with a laser scope, on Sunday, but investigators believe he only used one of the weapons in the attack. ""Video surveillance from inside the restaurant clearly shows that this is a single shooter incident and that the suspect took his own life after shooting the victims,"" Williams said. He said Katz purchased both guns legally in Baltimore within the past month. Killed in the shooting were Elijah Clayton, 22, of Woodland Hills, California, and Taylor Robertson, 28, a married father of a young boy from Giles, West Virginia. Another 12 people were wounded in the shooting and a 13th person was injured fleeing the gunfire, Williams said. Police barricade a street near Jacksonville Landing in Jacksonville, Fla.,Aug. 26, 2018. Laura Heald/AP Clayton and Robertson were among the top players of the Madden NFL football e-game, according to EA Sports, publisher of the video game. Robertson -- nicknamed ""SpotMePlzzz"" -- was the defending champion of the Madden Classic, the Super Bowl for Madden gamers, held in Las Vegas. ""These two guys were two of the best Madden players in the world the last couple of years,"" Chris McFarland, a Madden gamer who was grazed in the head during Sunday shooting, told ABC News Monday from a Jacksonville hospital. Williams said Katz's motive for the shooting remains under investigation. In a video from a February 2017 interview Katz, who went by the nickname ""Bread,"" gave to an EA Sports announcer during a Madden regional competition in Buffalo, New York, he seemed to carry a chip on his shoulder for being seeded seventh in the tournament that he ended up winning. David Katz, right, has been identified by Jacksonville police as the suspected shooter at a Madden NFL esports tournament on Sunday, Aug. 26, 2018. Two people were killed and Katz committed suicide, police said. Twitter/@buffalobills ""I don't think of myself as a seventh seed. I think I'm one of the better players,"" Katz said in the interview. Sheriff Williams said Katz's car was located in Jacksonville, and investigators found the hotel room where he was staying. He said both have been searched, but would not disclose if investigators seized any evidence pertinent to the shooting. Charles Spencer, special agent in charge of the FBI's Jacksonville office, said federal agents were also in Baltimore investigating Katz's background. ""We're tracking down where the subject was before he was here [in Jacksonville], where he stayed, who he had contact with,"" Spencer said. ""In Baltimore, our agents are working with the subject's family. His parents, both mother and father, have been fully cooperative with the FBI, so far. They have provided us access to all the records we've requested."" The court records obtained by ABC News also show that in May 2006, David Katz received psychiatric treatment at the Howard County General Hospital in Columbia, Maryland. His father, according to the records, disagreed with medicating his son because antidepressants ""may increase suicidal thoughts in young people."" Timothy Anselimo, an esports competitor who goes by oLarry, was shot in the chest at a tournament in Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday, Aug. 26, 2018. Anselimo was visited by Gov. Rick Scott as he recovers.

The documents also show that David Katz refused treatment. ""It was clear from the testimony of both Mr. and Mrs. Katz that David had an extremely strong negative reaction both to Mrs. Katz taking David Katz to various mental health care professionals and Mrs. Katz giving him psychiatric drugs,"" according to court records detailing a hearing in the Katz's divorce. In April 2005, Katz's mother, Elizabeth Katz, called the police because her son was refusing mental health counseling, according to the records. A lawyer for his father, Richard Katz, argued that David Katz was then ""faced with the prospect of being put in handcuffs by the police,"" according to the records.

Videos on social media Monday night showed the display of solidarity on the Las Vegas Strip started around 10 p.m. That's around the time the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting began. As people were linking arms and holding hands Monday night near the concert site, officials and several hundred others across town listened to bagpipes and the names of the 58 victims being read aloud. A procession of pickup trucks with American flags flying from their truck beds drove down the Strip around the same time honking their horns. ___ 10:10 p.m. Officials are reading the names of the 58 people who were killed in last year's mass shooting on the Las Vegas Strip to mark the anniversary of the tragedy. The names were read Monday before survivors and family members of the victims shortly after 10:05 p.m., the time when the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting on the Las Vegas Strip began. Monday's ceremony at a downtown Las Vegas park where trees have been planted for every victim began with two minutes of bagpipes. Candles were also lit to commemorate those killed, and sobs could be heard in the crowd. Many in attendance are wearing T-shirts and other apparel with the Vegas Strong message that became a rallying cry for the city after the shooting. ___ 10:00 p.m. Casinos lining the famous Las Vegas Strip have dimmed their glittering lights to mark the first anniversary of a mass shooting at a concert that left 58 dead and hundreds wounded. The casino lights and famous Welcome to Las Vegas sign were darkened for three minutes starting at 10:01 p.m. Monday — around the time a gunman opened fire from the gold tower of Mandalay Bay hotel across the street from the country music festival. Story continues The shooting is the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. The Strip's bright lights were last dimmed in October 2017, marking a week after the shooting. The casinos' marquees also went dark after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001 and to mark the deaths of famous Las Vegas entertainers like Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra, presidents like Ronald Reagan and local legends like former UNLV basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian. ___ 9:30 p.m. A popping noise similar to fireworks appeared to be causing distress for at least one attendee at a memorial garden in Las Vegas created in the wake of last year's mass shooting. The noise could be heard near the downtown Las Vegas memorial garden where officials, survivors of the shooting and family members of the 58 victims attended a dedication ceremony Monday night. The source of the noise wasn't immediately clear. A few people expressed anxiety about the crowd as people packed in to see the garden tribute. ___ 8:30 p.m. Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Nevada elected officials are honoring those killed in last year's mass shooting at a country music festival by placing red and white roses on a tribute wall and dedicating a memorial garden. At least 200 people, including survivors and victims' family members, attended the Monday evening event. The quarter-acre downtown garden features a tree for each of the 58 victims and an oak that represents life. It is the only permanent public space that has been created to memorialize those killed when a gunman opened fired from a high-rise casino-resort suite on a crowd of 22,000. Jay Pleggenkuhle (PLAY-ghen-kool) helped created the garden days after the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting. He said Monday that it was the community's way of reacting ""with a very deliberate act of compassion"" to the violence. ___ 7:15 p.m. Gun violence survivor and former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords is among the officials marking the anniversary of a mass shooting in Las Vegas. Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, attended the dedication Monday night of a memorial garden that is the only permanent public space created as a tribute to the 58 people killed in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting at a country music festival. Giffords did not speak at the ceremony but Kelly did, calling Las Vegas a ""resilient and tough"" community. Giffords, an Arizona Democrat, was gravely wounded in a 2011 shooting at a constituent gathering in Tucson. She has since founded a gun safety organization and a political operation working to defeat incumbent Republican lawmakers it faults for stalled efforts to curb gun violence. Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller is one of the incumbents the group is working to defeat. ___ 6:30 p.m. A garden that is the only permanent public space created in memory of the Las Vegas mass shooting victims is being formally dedicated during a ceremony Monday night. Survivors, victims' family members, Gov. Brian Sandoval and others are gathering at the downtown Las Vegas space on the one-year anniversary of the tragedy. The garden created by volunteers in the week after the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting is packed with colorful flowers, photos, flags and other mementos placed in memory of the victims. The quarter-acre garden is home to 59 trees — one for each victim plus an oak that represents life — and a remembrance wall that has the names of all who were killed while attending an outdoor country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. The garden is a few feet away from a bus stop and an adult store and miles from the shooting site. ___ 4:35 p.m. Las Vegas is phasing out the ""Vegas Strong"" slogan that became a rallying cry for the community after the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. A year later, the phrase is being replaced with ""Vegas Stronger."" Fifty-eight people were killed and hundreds were injured Oct. 1, 2017, when a gunman fired from the Mandalay Bay casino-resort into a crowd attending a country music festival on the Las Vegas Strip. Casino-resorts and the city's airport are among those who tweeted Monday the community has shown resiliency and bravery over the past year. A video included in some tweets shows the Las Vegas skyline and #VEGASSTRONGER. The Mandalay Bay's electronic billboard along the freeway is interchanging the ""Vegas Stronger"" message with ads for its spa and aquarium. ___ 3:15 p.m. On the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in the nation's modern history, the determined and the curious were turned away from the concert venue that became a killing field a year ago. Officials with MGM Resorts International handed out maps and fliers on Monday to pedestrians who reached a locked and screened gate at the unused Las Vegas Strip festival grounds. The company owns both the concert venue and the Mandalay Bay hotel, from which a gunman fired assault-style rifles from the 32nd floor, killing 58 people and injuring more than 850 on Oct. 1, 2017. The fliers suggested a short walk to a neighboring Catholic church for ""quiet reflection"" inside or to sign a commemorative banner — or a trip to a planned evening dedication at a downtown memorial garden. No parking was allowed along Las Vegas Boulevard and police closed a street between the church and the concert grounds, which has not been used since the shooting. ____ 1:55 p.m. Survivors and others marking the Las Vegas Strip mass shooting have held an evangelical vigil at City Hall to pray for the 58 people who were killed and more than 800 injured. Event organizer Pastor Troy Martinez declared that God was with the several dozen people praying and singing Monday beneath flags at half-staff on the steps of city government. A trio of friends from California — Jann Blake of Menifee, Linda Hazelwood of Anaheim and Michelle Hamel of Yorba Linda — held hands and bowed heads as several preachers considered the Oct. 1, 2017, carnage. Blake recalled strangers helping the three escape the Route 91 Harvest Festival concert venue without physical injuries. She said the ceremony wasn't about closure, but to remember the good that happened that night. ____ 12:40 p.m. Players from the NHL's Vegas Golden Knights plan to take part in several community events marking the anniversary of the Las Vegas Strip shooting. The team says they'll visit a blood drive at the Las Vegas Convention Center Monday and go to Community Ambulance in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson to honor 21 emergency responders who were at the festival when the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting began. Golden Knights players and team employees also plan to visit employees at the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor, and police and fire first-response dispatchers who fielded thousands of emergency calls. The Knights' inaugural season home opener last October came just days after the deadliest mass shooting in the nation's modern history. The team went on to stun the league with a run to the Stanley Cup Final. The team retired jersey No. 58 to honor shooting victims, and hoisted a banner with 58 stars to the rafters of T-Mobile Arena. ___ 10:15 a.m. President Donald Trump said rapid-fire devices like those used in the Las Vegas massacre a year ago will soon be ""ruled out."" Speaking in the Rose Garden on the anniversary of the attack that left 58 people dead, Trump said his administration is working through the process. He said, ""We are knocking out bump stocks. I've told the NRA. Bump stocks are gone."" Trump said the matter is working its way through regulations and public hearings. He spoke on the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Fifty-eight people died when a gunman fired from the Mandalay Bay casino-resort into an outdoor concert crowd on the Las Vegas Strip. He then killed himself. Many of the 23 assault-style rifles found by police were modified with bump stocks. ___ 10 a.m. Country music stations nationwide are planning a minute of silence to mark the one-year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in the nation's modern history. A country music trade group called Country Aircheck is encouraging radio stations and others connected with country music to pause on Monday for 58 seconds at 10:05 a.m. Pacific Time. That time will commemorate the number of people shot and killed Oct. 1, 2017, at an outdoor country music concert on the Las Vegas Strip. Country singer Jason Aldean was on stage when the shooting started. Country Aircheck is using hashtags #CountryStrong and #VegasStrong to promote the effort. It says the Nevada Association of Broadcasters, Academy of Country Music, ASCAP, Beasley Broadcast Group, CMT media company, Nashville Songwriters Association International and various entities in Nashville are among those planning to take part. ____ 9 a.m. President Donald Trump is marking the one-year anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history as he speaks at the White House on a revamped trade agreement with America's neighbors. Trump is sending his ""thoughts and prayers"" to victims of last year's Las Vegas shooting, which he called ""a horrible, horrible time in the life of our country."" Trump said Monday from the Rose Garden that, ""All of America is grieving for the lives lost and for the families they left behind."" He adds: ""We love you, we are with you. We're working with you very hard.'"" Fifty eight people were killed and hundreds injured when a gunman in a high-rise hotel rained gunfire into a crowd of 22,000 attending an open-air country music concert. ___ 7:35 a.m. The chief executive of MGM Resorts International is calling last year's mass shooting in Las Vegas ""an unforgettable act of terror."" Company chairman and CEO Jim Murren said in a statement Monday that the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting that killed 58 people and injured more than 850 was a ""senseless act of evil."" MGM owns the Mandalay Bay hotel, where the gunman was when he opened fire into an outdoor concert crowd below on the Las Vegas Strip. Police and the FBI have not called the shooting a terrorist act or said the Mandalay Bay gunman was linked to a conspiracy. They say he acted alone. How the event is characterized is important for MGM Resorts because it wants to invoke a federal anti-terrorism law enacted after Sept. 11, 2001, in defense of negligence lawsuits alleging that the casino giant could have prevented the shooting. In his statement, Murren says that through unity and determination the Oct. 1 anniversary can become a day of healing and hope. ___ 7:15 a.m. A somber sunrise remembrance ceremony is underway in Las Vegas at an event that begins a day of memorials on the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Several hundred people including survivors, families of victims, first-responders and elected officials gathered at an outdoor amphitheater in Las Vegas Monday to hear Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval speak about the 58 people who were killed on Oct. 1, 2017. He said: ""Today we remember the unforgettable. Today, we comfort the inconsolable."" Sandoval added: ""Today, we are reminded of the pain that never really goes away."" Prayers, songs, speeches and the release of 58 doves as Las Vegas were planned for the a day of memorials and other events. Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo is also scheduled to speak at the daybreak event. ____ 6:10 a.m. Sunrise is brightening the horizon over Las Vegas, where survivors, victims' family members, first-responders and elected officials are gathering to mark the anniversary of the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history. Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval and Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo are among speakers at a daybreak memorial featuring the release of a flock of doves to honor the 58 people who were killed on Oct. 1, 2017. Music from the Las Vegas Academy of the Arts high school Academy Singers and 58 seconds of silence are scheduled during the remembrance at the Clark County Government Center amphitheater. The government center also is hosting the Las Vegas Portraits Project. It features artists' renderings of the people killed at a Route 91 Harvest Festival country music concert. That display continues through Oct. 19, when the works will be presented to victims' loved ones. Las Vegas city officials plan to host a prayer vigil beginning at 11:30 a.m. in the plaza in front of City Hall. ____ 1:15 a.m. It's been a year since the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, and a scheduled speaker at a sunrise ceremony in Las Vegas is calling it a tragedy of grand scale. Mynda Smith's sister was one of 58 people killed when a gunman in a high-rise hotel rained gunfire into a crowd of 22,000 attending an open-air country music concert. Smith started a scholarship fund for victims' children and says she reached loved ones of almost all the dead. She says that for some, it may be too soon for hearts to be healed. Survivors, victims' family members, first-responders and elected officials will offer prayers, songs, speeches and the release of 58 doves as Las Vegas begins a day of memorials and other events. ____ Find complete AP coverage of the Las Vegas mass shooting here: https://apnews.com/tag/LasVegasmassshooting",2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting Las Vegas Andrea Castilla Man Shooting Mass shooting   2017,"A woman and her son, Adam, who was killed in the shooting at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on Monday.","LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Latest on events marking the anniversary of the Oct. 1, 2017, mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 58 people and injured more than 850 (all times local): 10:40 p.m.","the las vegas strip began around 10:40 p.m. monday night to mark the anniversary of the oct. 1, 2017,000 mass shooting in las vegas. hundreds of survivors of the shooting have formed a human chain around the shuttered site of a country music festival where a gunman opened fire last year. on monday, the victims were read aloud at a procession of pickup trucks with american flags flying from their truck beds drove down the strip around the same time honking their horns",1,2,7,99,3,0,1,99.0,0,99

The rampage took place at the GLHF Game Bar in downtown Jacksonville, which was livestreaming a regional qualifier for a new football video game, Madden NFL 19.

They said he killed two people before taking his own life, but declined to comment on his motive. The killings rocked the world of professional electronic gaming, also known as esports, which boasts an estimated 250 million players worldwide in a growing market worth about a billion dollars a year.

Beierle, who killed himself on Friday after killing Nancy Van Vessem and Maura Binkley and wounding five others at Hot Yoga Tallahassee, had filmed several virulently misogynist videos in 2014, according to David Mack, Amber Jamieson, and Julia Reinstein of BuzzFeed News. He had also uploaded sexist and violent songs to Soundcloud in the last few months. In the videos, Beierle rants about women who canceled dates or gave him their phone numbers even though they had boyfriends. He also mentions Elliot Rodger, the gunman who killed six people and wounded 13 in Isla Vista, California in 2014 — and who has become a hero to men who identify as “incels” (short for “involuntary celibate”). The Tallahassee shooting was the third crime in a single week that was apparently preceded by a trail of online hate. Robert Bowers, the man suspected of killing 11 people and wounding six others in a shooting at a Pittsburgh synagogue last Saturday, appears to have posted threatening language about Jewish people and HIAS National Refugee Shabbat, a refugee aid group formerly known as the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society, on Gab, a social network that has become a home for anti-Semitism and racism. Cesar Sayoc, the man arrested last Friday in connection with bombs mailed to CNN and several critics of President Donald Trump, appears to have threatened Democrats on Twitter and Facebook. “Hug your loved son,Niece,wife family real close everytime U walk out your home,” said one tweet sent to former Vice President Joe Biden, apparently by Sayoc. It included an image of Biden’s home with a target superimposed on it. The postings apparently made by Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were part of a pattern going back years. Elliot Rodger left behind a YouTube video in which he said women would be punished for not being attracted to him. And George Sodini, a gunman whose murder of three women at a gym outside Pittsburgh in 2009 appears to share similarities with the Tallahassee shooting, maintained a blog detailing his anger toward women for months before committing the crime. These men share more than their apparent online histories of bigotry. All were part of communities, online or off, that seemed to reinforce their views. That’s why online hatred and harassment is so serious. It’s not just that an individual person’s online posts can be warning signs of future violence. It’s also that hateful posts, even by those who never commit crimes, create an environment where those crimes are encouraged, accepted, and even celebrated. Many mass murderers and other criminals have left behind an online trail Beierle’s YouTube and SoundCloud history is rife with violent sexism. In one video, he says of a woman who canceled dates with him, “I could have ripped her head off,” according to BuzzFeed. In a song called “Locked in My Basement,” he describes holding a woman prisoner and raping her. He mentions Rodger in a video called “Plight of the Adolescent Male,” saying, “I’d like to send a message now to the adolescent males ... that are in the position, the situation, the disposition of Elliot Rodger, of not getting any, no love, no nothing. This endless wasteland that breeds this longing and this frustration. That was me, certainly, as an adolescent.” Beierle had also been arrested in 2012 and 2016 for grabbing women’s buttocks without their consent, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. Meanwhile, posts apparently by Robert Bowers, the alleged Pittsburgh assailant, reveal a history of anti-Semitism, and a web of influences. On Gab, someone by the name of Robert Bowers posted a variety of anti-Semitic slurs and statements, including “jews are the children of satan,” according to the Associated Press. The same user criticized President Trump for being insufficiently anti-Jewish, and bragged about his gun collection, calling it his “glock family” and saying one gun in particular had an “amazing trigger.” As Vox’s Jane Coaston notes, Gab was started as a “free speech” alternative to Twitter, and allows forms of hate speech that are banned on more mainstream social networks. Because of this, it’s become a gathering place — and recruitment forum — for neo-Nazi groups. One post from a group called Atomwaffen Division features swastikas, racial slurs, and the invitation, “Join your local Nazis.” The synagogue shooting suspect also acted out of a specific kind of anti-Semitism, as Vox’s Dara Lind points out: “blaming Jews in America for bringing in an invasion of nonwhite immigrants who would slaughter the white race.” This particular kind of bigotry has been fueled by Trump’s claims that his political opponents are at fault for the caravan of migrants approaching the US, and by anti-Semitic conspiracy theorists on Gab and other social networks, who have cast the caravan as a Jewish “invasion.” Most of the people posting this theory online have never committed anti-Semitic violence, but they helped create the conditions under which something like the Pittsburgh shooting could occur. Twitter and Facebook accounts connected to Sayoc contain threats against Biden and former Attorney General Eric Holder, both of whom received pipe bombs. CNN analyst Phil Mudd also received a Twitter threat apparently from Sayoc. Political analyst Rochelle Ritchie reported a threat apparently from Sayoc to Twitter in the days before the shooting, but Twitter did not take action. Sayoc was apparently a devotee of a variety of conspiracy theories, many of which have spread on Twitter. As Vox’s German Lopez points out, he often posted criticisms of liberal billionaire George Soros, a common target of anti-Semitic fear-mongering on Twitter and elsewhere. Trump has fanned the flames of this fear-mongering, retweeting a claim earlier this year that Soros was a “nazi who turned in his fellow Jews.” Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc were far from alone in leaving what appear to be online trails pointing to future violent behavior. “Tomorrow is the day of retribution,” Rodger said in his last YouTube video, according to the New York Times. “For the last eight years of my life, ever since I hit puberty, I’ve been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and unfulfilled desires. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me.” “I do not know why you girls aren’t attracted to me,” he added. “But I will punish you all for it.” Rodger also identified as an “incel” and posted on forums populated by men with similar frustrations. The 22-year-old, who took his own life after killing others, became something of a hero to other “incels,” as Vox’s Zack Beauchamp has noted. A man who killed 10 people by driving a van down a Toronto street in April identified himself on Facebook as part of the “Incel Rebellion.” Also on Facebook, he praised the Rodger, calling him the “Supreme Gentleman,” a nickname Rodger had chosen for himself. The man who shot and killed three women at a Pittsburgh gym, meanwhile, wrote on his personal website in 2008, “I dress good, am clean-shaven, bathe, touch of cologne – yet 30 million women rejected me – over an 18 or 25-year period.” “A man needs a woman for confidence,” he added. “He gets a boost on the job, career, with other men, and everywhere else when he knows inside he has someone to spend the night with and who is also a friend. This type of life I see is a closed world with me specifically and totally excluded.” He also had ties to the pickup artist community, having purchased the book How to Date Young Women: For Men Over 35, and appearing in a video of one of author R. Don Steele’s lectures. Pickup artistry, more in vogue in the early 2000s than it is now, sometimes treated women as less human than men, as “targets” to be coerced or fooled into sex. It’s not murder, of course, but this was the climate of misogyny in which he planned his crime. Fighting hate crimes means understanding the communities that support them Each of these men may have seemed like a loner — but in fact, each was part of a group of people with similarly toxic views directed at Jewish people, women, or people of color. And we need to understand crimes like the Tallahassee and Pittsburgh shootings and the mailing of pipe bombs to Democrats within their larger context of on- and offline hate. That means holding platforms accountable for the behavior they allow. In the wake of the pipe bombings, Twitter has apologized for not taking Ritchie’s report more seriously. “We are investigating what happened and will continue to work to improve how we handle concerns raised by anyone on Twitter,” the account @TwitterSafety tweeted last week. But in response to a request for specifics from The Verge, the company merely pointed to blog posts from earlier in the year. “This is a familiar story from Twitter,” the Verge’s Andrew Liptak writes: “apologizing for reacting after the fact after it becomes clear that someone violated the site’s terms.” Gab, meanwhile, is being more defiant. “Gab.com is under attack,” read a message posted by the company on Monday. “We have been smeared by the mainstream media for defending free expression and individual liberty for all people and for working with law enforcement to ensure that justice is served for the horrible atrocity committed in Pittsburgh.” Investigating and prosecuting online threats can be tricky because perpetrators can conceal their identities and locations, and because when someone in one part of the country threatens someone in another, it’s not always clear which law enforcement agency should take the case. But there’s evidence that law enforcement, even at the federal level, isn’t doing all it can: The Department of Justice prosecutes only a small minority of cases of online threats and stalking, Joshua Eaton reported at ThinkProgress last year. A bill that would provide resources to help the FBI, DOJ, and local authorities fight such crimes, introduced by Rep. Katherine Clark (D-MA), has been stuck in committee since last July. While law enforcement can prosecute threats and stalking, other hate speech isn’t illegal. But that doesn’t mean companies like Twitter have to allow it on their platforms. As journalist Stacy-Marie Ishmael pointed out on Twitter, women, and especially black women, who experience disproportionate harassment online, have been warning of the seriousness of this harassment for years. Their warnings have mostly fallen on deaf ears. Taking online hate seriously would require platforms like Twitter to make fighting threats and bigotry a core part of their mission, not an afterthought. As Kate Klonick wrote at Vox in 2016, “Twitter needs to view fighting abuse as an essential feature.” It also means law enforcement, government, and ordinary users need to be aware of the ways in which online communities can fuel offline hate. Men like Beierle, Bowers, and Sayoc have been posting about their violent intentions for years now, and getting support and affirmation for doing so.

John. R. Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and the author of the new study, has always been skeptical of the research by Adam Lankford, a professor at the University of Alabama, whose work gained special prominence after then-President Barack Obama cited his study in remarks about the San Bernardino attack in December 2015. Lott raised alarm bells that Lankford, who found that between 1966 and 2012 the U.S. had 31 percent of public mass shooters in the world despite accounting for less than five percent of the population, did not do diligent research and refused to be transparent about his work, including not sharing his paper with others as he started his media blitz tour promoting the study in 2015. US GUN CONTROL ADVOCATES EXAGGERATE BENEFITS OF AUSTRALIA'S GUN RESTRICTIONS ""Here’s an amazing thing, [Lankford] refuses to provide his list of cases, he refuses to explain exactly how he got it. This is not just some normal academic study – President Obama many times cited this study as a source for his claims."" — John. R. Lott Jr. “Here’s an amazing thing, [Lankford] refuses to provide his list of cases, he refuses to explain exactly how he got it. This is not just some normal academic study – President Obama many times cited this study as a source for his claims. I can’t find any other academic research that’s gotten so much worldwide attention,” Lott told Fox News, adding that people across the world heard about the study. Despite that, the study became go-to research across the media, with the New York Times and CNN frequently citing it. Just this Wednesday, liberal news site Vox referenced a CNN article that cited Lankford’s work. Lankford declined an interview request about his study and told Fox News in an email that he’s “not interested in giving any serious thought to John Lott or his claims.” With little success to stop the myth of mass shootings as a uniquely American problem becoming ingrained across the world, Lott took the matter into his own hands, releasing a comprehensive study this week that debunks Lankford’s claims. ARMING TEACHERS A DECISION FOR STATES, LOCAL DISTRICTS, DEVOS SAYS After crunching the numbers, Lott concluded in his study that the U.S. accounts for less than three percent of the world’s mass public shootings over a 15-year period – between 1998 and 2012 – which is significantly lower than what Lankford’s work has shown. ""My most conservative count is well over three thousand shooters over just the last 15 years. My best count is that there were 10,800 of these public mass shooters over the last 15 years."" — John. R. Lott Jr. Lott said that he looked at the last 15 years rather than the last 47 years as Lankford did, because it’s nearly impossible to come up with perfectly accurate information about mass public shooters in, for example, Africa in the 1960s. “My most conservative count is well over three thousand shooters over just the last 15 years. My best count is that there were 10,800 of these public mass shooters over the last 15 years,” Lott said. Compare that with Lankford’s research, which found merely 292 mass public shooters over a 47-year period across the world, with 90 of those in the U.S., per his research. CALIFORNIA BILL TO EXPAND GUN-TAKEAWAY LAW ADVANCES TO GOVERNOR'S DESK Lott is committed to transparency about his study, listing every single case used in the research in a massive 451-page appendix of the study. He claims to have used the University of Maryland’s Global Terrorism Database, complimented by additional search tools to find cases that weren’t listed in the dataset. Of 1,491 mass public shootings reviewed by Lott, only 43 of those were in the U.S. This represents just 2.88 percent of all the cases. In per capita terms, the data put the U.S. below Finland, Norway or Switzerland. It’s still slightly higher than other Western countries such as France, Germany or the United Kingdom. Lankford’s main conclusion of his data was that there’s something in the American culture that makes people commit more public mass shootings than people in other cultures. For Lott, the actual data shows that the mass shooter problem in the U.S. is far from being a unique American experience. His question remains how the media and a president was able to get away with pushing a botched study published in a “low-rank journal” despite criticism.",Jacksonville Landing Jacksonville Landing shooting Video Games Madden NFL 19 Shooting Mass shooting    Game,"The First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Tex., was the site of a mass shooting there in October 2015.","A widely-popularized study adopted by the Obama administration claiming the U.S. has by far the most mass public shooters in the world has been criticized and dismissed by new research.

On Feb. 11, 2017, he legally bought an AR-15 assault rifle. It would be used a year later, almost to the day, when the authorities say he returned to Stoneman Douglas on Feb. 14 and killed 17 students and staff members in one of the deadliest school shootings in American history. Mr. Cruz, now 19, remains in jail awaiting trial on charges of capital murder. The new details about Mr. Cruz’s educational record come from a consultant’s report commissioned by the Broward school district to review how it handled Mr. Cruz’s education. A judge ordered the release of the review, conducted by the Collaborative Educational Network of Tallahassee, over the objections of Mr. Cruz’s defense lawyers after several news organizations, including The New York Times, sued to make it public. The report found little fault in the school district’s handling of Mr. Cruz’s special needs. Yet two key errors his junior year left Mr. Cruz without therapeutic services from the district for more than a year before the shooting and prevented him from returning to Cross Creek, the only high school where he had improved his behavior and found some academic success. They are the latest in a series of lapses by federal, state and local officials who came in contact with Mr. Cruz during his troubled teenage years but failed to take actions that might have prevented the shooting. “We accept the recommendations regarding procedural improvements, and are pleased with the overall review, recommendations and findings,” Robert W. Runcie, the Broward schools superintendent, said in a statement on Friday. “We are actively reviewing our policies and procedures, training protocols and data systems in an effort to implement the recommendations in a timely and effective way.” Much of the educational report was redacted, as approved by Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer to protect Mr. Cruz’s privacy. But the text of the blacked-out document could nevertheless be extracted, copied and pasted into another file so that it could be read in full.

Audience members watch with rapt attention as the cast of Spring Awakening reappears from backstage, now dressed in modern activist T-shirts. “All shall know the song of purple summer,” choruses the cast, receiving a standing ovation. Me + You Productions’ “Spring Awakening,” a musical adaptation of the 1891 play “Spring Awakening” by Frank Wedekind, tells the tale of adolescents in 1890s Germany, revealing the consequences of growing up in a repressive and ultra-conservative society that forbids all sexual conduct. The original 2006 Broadway production won eight Tonys, one of which was “Best Musical.” Sitting in the middle seat of the front row on opening night, I was extremely impressed by Me + You Productions’ socio-political spin on “Spring Awakening.” The level of intimacy with the audience caused goosebumps to appear on my arms when Andrew Gleckler, starring as Melchior Gabor, chose to sing his first song, “All That’s Known,” while making direct eye contact with everyone in the first row. Furthermore, the amount of sophistication displayed by the cast never ceased to astound me, considering that the only furniture they had to work with were chairs. The aspect that I respected the most, however, was the play’s overarching push for gun control. Signs with quotes from victims, statistics on recent shootings, and more were utilized to create the stage’s background, and Me + You Productions plans to donate 100 percent of ticket proceeds from this production to Everytown for Gun Safety, a nonprofit organization who aims to reduce gun deaths in the wake of increased mass shootings. As a teenager growing up in a time period where school shootings seem inevitable, I cannot help but be frightened when I realize how desensitized my community is to violence. Because of social media’s tendency to over-dramatize and the increased occurrence of shootings, teenagers are often either too aware or completely ignorant of the dangers they face. Attending the play gave me great relief to know that there are adults actively advocating for gun control. “Spring Awakening” delves deeply and poignantly into the issues that our society faces today,” said Asha Noel lyer, Me + You Productions Founder and “Spring Awakening” Producer. “I wanted to tangibly affect the world, and I chose to do this play because I couldn’t get over the parallels. We live in a world that doesn’t protect its youth, and that is directly what the show is about.” Me + You Productions is set to close out their three-week running of “Spring Awakening” this weekend at The Lounge Theatre in West Hollywood.

708,708,10862,http://us.cnn.com/2018/03/27/politics/repealing-the-second-amendment/index.html,There's not a 'snowflake's chance in hell' of repealing the Second Amendment,"(CNN) How could those high school kids have marched en masse and not achieved any meaningful reform? That seems to be the state of affairs: The gun laws seem intractably set, despite growing public support to change them, at least on the periphery of the laws. Measures passed in Florida after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting seem to have no prospects at the national level. But former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is not talking about frittering around the edges of anything. He issued a modest proposal in The New York Times to get rid of the Second Amendment altogether. Repeal it, he says Stevens argued that a right to bear arms, which the Supreme Court has said the Second Amendment guarantees, should mean something different in the era of today's weapons and today's civil society, and, in the spirit of many gun-control advocates, pointed out the Second Amendment is talking about militias when it brings up ""arms."" The entire text of the Second Amendment, remember, is this: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Stevens has railed in the past about how far we've gotten from the idea of militias in the interpretation of the Second Amendment -- and he channels that view in the op-ed. ""Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed,'"" he writes in the Times. ""Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century."" He then launches into a Supreme Court history lesson on how gun laws evolved from 1789 to a unanimous decision against sawed-off shotguns in 1939 because they weren't appropriate for use in a ""well-regulated militia"" -- through the landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller that threw the whole idea of a well-regulated militia out the window. That case changed the interpretation of the Second Amendment's clause concerning guns to be an individual right for self-defense. Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in the case, by the way, is a marvel of grammatical gymntastics , that decides the amendment is not about the well-regulated militia discussed in the text, but rather that ""it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home."" Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford, but he often sided with the more liberal wing of the court during his tenure and he resigned during the Obama administration, resulting in Elena Kagan being confirmed to take his spot on the bench. So he's bringing a more liberal mindset to this issue. It's also unlikely to happen. Probably ever. Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and Second Amendment expert who supports gun control, was tweeting Tuesday about Stevens' piece, and said, ""there's not a snowflake's chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment any time soon."" Of course all this overlooks the obvious problem: There's not a snowflakes chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment anytime soon. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 ""We can't even get Congress to pass a law banning bump stocks,"" Winkler wrote. ""We can't get Congress to mandate universal background checks. And Stevens thinks 2/3s of Congress will vote to repeal the 2A? And 3/4 of the states will ratify such an amendment? Nonsense."" But it's still worth examining whether repealing the Second Amendment is actually that what people want. There is, indeed, great support for tighter gun laws -- seven in 10 Americans said in a CNN poll after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting that they'd support new gun restrictions. That's the highest such support in 25 years. But on more specific proposals that could be seen as limiting gun rights, there were very partisan divides. A ban on semi-automatic weapons, for instance, had the support of 80% of Democrats and 53% of independents, but just 34% of Republicans, for instance. The idea of limiting the number of guns an individual can own garners 69% support among Democrats vs. just 23% among Republicans, according to that CNN poll. It's hard to find any recent reliable polling on the larger idea of repealing the amendment completely, but if there are sharp divides on specific efforts to curb gun rights, it's a good bet that an entire repeal would be even more controversial. A minority of American households have guns -- 30%, according to a Pew survey in 2017, with 16% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans owning guns. It's important here to say that Stevens did not say in his op-ed that guns should be taken away from anyone who has them, just that the Second Amendment should be repealed. What would be left to regulate the many millions of guns already in the country? That would have to be figured out. But you can hear the slogan opponents would use against an effort like Stevens' proposal: They're trying to take your guns away! In fact, that's a slogan President Donald Trump used effectively against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016 (and since then), accusing her of wanting to ""take your guns away"" even though Clinton said she was a supporter of Second Amendment rights. JUST WATCHED Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' 01:13 Winkler also argued that Stevens' proposal is counterproductive because it backs up the claim by Trump and the NRA that supporters of gun control want to take away guns. ""Stevens's call to repeal the 2A is not only ineffective but worse: it makes it even harder to pass good gun laws today. It plays right into the hands of the @nra which can now point to this op-ed and say, 'See, we told you they want to take away your rights and your guns.'"" Current Democratic leaders, even as they have pushed for new gun control, have made clear they support the Second Amendment. If national elections are going to be won and lost in the Rust Belt, Democrats will need support from gun rights supporters if they're going to win congressional or presidential elections. ""I believe in the Second Amendment, there's a right to bear arms,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in February. ""Every law-abiding citizen has the right to have a gun unless you're a felon, or you're adjudicated mentally ill, everyone agrees to that."" Even if Democrats turned wholesale against the Second Amendment (and gave up any claim they had on moderates and gun lovers in their party), there's the not-so-small difficulty of actually changing the Constitution. The Constitution has been amended 27 times in US history, including the original 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. The last amendment ratified was the 27th in 1992, which made it so Congress can't raise its own wages until the following Congress. That took decades to pass. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and CNN contributor, said it's not impossible to repeal the Second Amendment, but perhaps Stevens was trying to reframe the arguments. ""I wonder if Justice Stevens was trying to take a step back from the politics of the moment to situate the debate in a broader context,"" he said, although he pointed out that changes to the Constitution have been few and far between. ""There have only been 17 amendments in 231 years, and most of those have been about the structure of government/elections/voting, not substantive rights. It's really quite difficult to get an amendment through, especially on a divisive question of social policy,"" Vladeck said. None of the original 10 amendments has ever been repealed or changed, so you're well into uncharted territory with Stevens' idea. The only amendment which really took something away from citizens was the 18th Amendment, which was enacted in 1920 and made alcohol illegal on the national level. And maybe the precedent for what Stevens proposes is the 21st Amendment, by which the 18th Amendment was repealed 13 years later. It takes an amendment to repeal an amendment. Article V of the Constitution lays out that process, which requires supermajorities in Congress and of state legislatures and/or constitutional conventions. So politically and procedurally, Stevens' idea is a conversation-starter (and maybe a much-needed conversation-starter), but not much else. Repealing the Second Amendment isn't likely to happen any time soon. To say the least. But Stevens doesn't seem to be worried about those details. He's making a broader point about the court and guns. Later in his piece, Stevens suggests the entire aim of getting rid of the Second Amendment would be to overturn that decision in Heller, which made gun ownership an individual right. ""Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option,"" he writes. I agree! We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the 2A, gun control proponents need to mobilize politically. That seems to be happening now. https://t.co/IS1cYJuWwT — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 Winkler said marchers and other activists should stay the course they are on. ""We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the (Second Amendment), gun control proponents need to mobilize politically,"" he wrote. Vladeck argued there is plenty of gun control legislation that can be achieved under the current structure and he pointed to a Maryland assault weapons case as proof. ""So we may not need either a different Supreme Court or a constitutional amendment to achieve most of what reformers are seeking; we just need folks to realize that the principal objections to many of these proposals are political, not constitutional,"" Vladeck said.","Gun Remington Arms Remington Outdoor Company Inc.

The San Francisco bank issued a $40-million line of credit last week to gun manufacturer Sturm, Ruger & Co., according to financial filings. That’s on top of the $431 million in debt that Wells Fargo has arranged for gun makers since December 2012, when the Sandy Hook school shooting escalated the gun control debate. No other bank lent more to the industry over that time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The new debt, issued to one of the world’s largest publicly traded gun makers, came as a big surprise to at least one group: nuns who had been talking to Wells Fargo about corporate-responsibility issues. On Sept. 26, the day before the debt agreement was issued, they met with the bank’s business-standards employees in New York. “This is shocking news because we are in sustained dialogue with Wells Fargo,” said Nora Nash, a sister at St. Francis of Philadelphia who was at the meeting as a member of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. “This new business relationship with Sturm Ruger is in direct conflict with ethics, culture and respect for human rights throughout the company.” Advertisement Unlike Wells Fargo, a number of big banks, including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., said they would reduce ties to gun makers after the February mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., that left 17 dead. Wells Fargo also has a long relationship with the NRA, offering credit and operating its primary bank accounts. Wells Fargo said it continues to work with the Interfaith Center on business standards. “Wells Fargo wants schools and communities to be safe from gun violence, but changes to laws and regulations should be determined through a legislative process that gives the American public an opportunity to participate and not be arbitrarily set by a bank,” the bank said in a statement. Bank of America had extended credit to Ruger until June, when the line expired. After the Parkland shooting, it had specifically said it would stop lending to companies that make assault-style rifles — which the company does. Advertisement The Charlotte, N.C., bank said it doesn’t comment on client matters. A representative for Ruger did not respond to requests for comment. The religious community has been playing a shareholder-activist role on the gun issue. This year, groups introduced shareholder proposals at Ruger and American Outdoor Brands Corp., formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding Corp., that require the companies to produce reports on gun safety. Both proposals passed. The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility is involved in the business-standards review with Wells Fargo. The bank said in its 2018 proxy statement it has agreed to conduct the review and publish the results on its website by year’s end. It’s unknown how Ruger will use the line of credit. During an earnings call in February, President Christopher J. Killoy said the company was closely watching Remington Outdoor Co., a firearms and ammunition juggernaut that went through bankruptcy protection this year. Advertisement The line of credit “gives them the flexibility to use the line or not use it, so is perfect for having the ability to make future acquisitions,” said Rommel Dionisio, a gun-industry analyst with Aegis Capital Corp. Laura Krausa, an investor in Ruger through the nonprofit Catholic Health Initiatives, said the company should use the debt to pay for research into smart guns. “In being optimistic,” she said, “we would really hope that a line of credit this large would be put to good use in really answering that call to have the gun manufacturers be a part of the solution to the increasing problem of gun violence in America.”",Wells Fargo  Bank Loan Mortgage loan Insurance  Finance Financial services Car finance,A Wells Fargo branch in New York.

The guns-in-schools plan would tap federal grants that are traditionally intended for academic enrichment and student services, but instead allow states to use the money to purchase firearms for teachers. The plan would take advantage of a loophole that, unlike other school safety measures, does not explicitly prohibit the use of the money for guns. As my colleague Ella Nilsen noted, this answers a call by some Republican lawmakers and the National Rifle Association (NRA). They believe that arming more teachers will allow educators to keep students safe by defending them from a mass shooter. As the NRA often says, “The only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is with a good guy with a gun.” Will the proposal ever become reality? We don’t know yet. Asked about the plan, a Department of Education spokesperson told the Times, “The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety. The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” The evidence suggests, however, that the guns-in-schools plan would make schools more dangerous, not safer. While there is no good research specifically on arming teachers (which by itself should raise red flags, given that policy should be evidence-based), there is plenty of evidence on what happens where there are more guns around. It’s pretty clear: Where there are more guns, there are more gun deaths. The logic is simple: The presence of a gun allows otherwise normal circumstances to escalate into deadly violence. If a teacher has a gun around, she or one of her students is more likely to fire it — accidentally or deliberately — than if a gun wasn’t around. That’s not to say that no one has ever successfully defended themselves or others from an attack with a firearm. The question is whether these incidents of successful defense would outweigh the new incidents of gun violence that would crop up due to the addition of more firearms in schools. And based on the research, the presence of more guns typically translates to much more general gun violence, while justified uses of a gun for self-defense are few and far between. So DeVos’s potential guns-in-schools plan would likely make school violence worse. 1) The research is clear: more guns, more gun deaths The US is unique in two key and related ways when it comes to guns: It has way more gun deaths than other developed nations, and it has far more guns than any other country in the world. The US has nearly six times the gun homicide rate of Canada, more than seven times that of Sweden, and nearly 16 times that of Germany, according to United Nations data compiled by the Guardian. (These gun deaths are a big reason America has a much higher overall homicide rate, which includes non-gun deaths, than other developed nations.) Mass shootings actually make up a small fraction of America’s gun deaths, constituting less than 2 percent of such deaths in 2013. But America does see a lot of these horrific events: According to CNN, “The US makes up less than 5% of the world’s population, but holds 31% of global mass shooters.” The US also has by far the highest number of privately owned guns in the world. Estimated for 2017, the number of civilian-owned firearms in the US was 120.5 guns per 100 residents, meaning there were more firearms than people. The world’s second-ranked country was Yemen, a quasi-failed state torn by civil war, where there were 52.8 guns per 100 residents, according to an analysis from the Small Arms Survey. Another way of looking at that: Americans make up less than 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they own roughly 45 percent of all the world’s privately held firearms. These two facts — on gun deaths and firearm ownership — are related. The research, compiled by the Harvard School of Public Health’s Injury Control Research Center, is pretty clear: After controlling for variables such as socioeconomic factors and other crime, places with more guns have more gun deaths. “Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide,” David Hemenway, the Injury Control Research Center’s director, wrote in Private Guns, Public Health. For example, a 2013 study led by a Boston University School of Public Health researcher found that, after controlling for multiple variables, each percentage point increase in gun ownership correlated with a roughly 0.9 percent rise in the firearm homicide rate. The correlation applies globally. This chart, based on data from GunPolicy.org, shows the correlation between the number of guns and gun deaths among wealthier nations: Guns are not the only contributor to violence. (Other factors include, for example, poverty, urbanization, and alcohol consumption.) But when researchers control for other confounding variables, they have found time and time again that America’s high level of gun ownership is a major reason the US is so much worse in terms of gun violence than its developed peers. As a breakthrough analysis by UC Berkeley’s Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins in the 1990s found, it’s not even that the US has more crime than other developed countries. This chart, based on data from Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University, shows that the US is not an outlier when it comes to overall crime: Instead, the US appears to have more lethal violence — and that’s driven in large part by the prevalence of guns. ”A series of specific comparisons of the death rates from property crime and assault in New York City and London show how enormous differences in death risk can be explained even while general patterns are similar,” Zimring and Hawkins wrote. “A preference for crimes of personal force and the willingness and ability to use guns in robbery make similar levels of property crime 54 times as deadly in New York City as in London.” This is in many ways intuitive. People of every country get into arguments and fights with friends, family, and peers. But in the US, it’s much more likely that someone will get angry during an argument and be able to pull out a gun and kill someone. Consider how this could apply to a school scenario. Some kids or teachers get into an argument. There’s a gun in the classroom. Someone reaches for that gun — and what may have otherwise been a feisty argument escalates into a fatal encounter. This might seem ridiculous, but consider that there have been shootings over disputes about cheeseburgers and tacos. In the heat of the moment, people can do very bad things. America does not have a monopoly on these kinds of disputes. What it does have, again, is easy access to guns, making escalation much more likely. Increasing the presence of guns in schools, then, could actually exacerbate gun violence. 2) For every criminal killed in self-defense, there are dozens more murders There’s another set of statistics that throws cold water on the “good guy with a gun” theory: It’s way more likely in America that someone will shoot and kill another person in the course of committing a crime than in self-defense. Christopher Ingraham at the Washington Post ran through the statistics. He looked at how many gun homicides, suicides, and accidental shootings there were in comparison to “justifiable” homicides (“the killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen”), based on the FBI’s 2012 data. He found that for every justifiable gun homicide, there were 34 criminal gun homicides, 78 gun suicides, and two accidental gun deaths. Data on mass shootings tells a similar story: According to the FBI’s report on active shooter events between 2000 and 2013, only about 3 percent were stopped by a civilian with a gun. Unarmed civilians actually stopped more incidents — about 13 percent. Most of the incidents — more than 56 percent — ended on the shooter’s initiative, when the shooter either killed himself or herself, simply stopped shooting, or fled the scene. Would more of these shootings be prevented if more people had guns? It’s hard to say — since, again, there’s no good research on that question. But America already has a lot of guns. And as the other data shows, that’s likely making its overall gun violence problem worse, not better. 3) Stopping a mass shooting is hard, even with firearms training In President Donald Trump’s past comments about arming teachers, he’s suggested that this would be an easy way to end mass shootings quickly. He previously tweeted, “History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!” Reality, however, is more complicated: Even when people are armed, that doesn’t mean they can properly respond to a mass shooting. Multiple simulations have demonstrated that most people, if placed in an active shooter situation while armed, will not be able to stop the situation, and may in fact do little more than get themselves killed in the process. This video from ABC News shows one such simulation, in which people repeatedly fail to shoot an active shooter before they’re shot: As Chris Benton, a police investigator in Pennsylvania, told ABC News, “Video games and movies, they glorify gunfights. [People] get that warped sense that this is true — this video game is exactly what I can do in real life. That’s not reality.” The Daily Show also put this theory to the test in another more comedic simulation segment. Jordan Klepper, who was a correspondent with the show at the time, trained on the basics of using a firearm and got a concealed carry permit that was valid in 30 states. Then he participated in mass shooting simulations to see how he would hold up in such a scenario. He failed — miserably. In his final test, which simulated a school shooting, he shot an unarmed civilian, and he was shot multiple times by the active shooters and even law enforcement, who mistook him for the bad guy. He never took down the active shooters. The fundamental problem is that mass shootings are traumatizing, terrifying events. Without potentially dozens or even hundreds of hours in training, most people are not going to be able to quickly and properly respond. “There’s never enough training,” Coby Briehn, a senior instructor at Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training, told Klepper. “You can never get enough.” The FBI’s analysis of active shooters between 2000 and 2013 has another relevant data point: “Law enforcement suffered casualties in 21 (46.7%) of the 45 incidents where they engaged the shooter to end the threat.” These are people trained to do this kind of thing full-time, and nearly half of incidents resulted in at least one officer wounded or killed. Teachers with limited training would very likely fare much worse. None of that is to say that a “good guy with a gun” would never be able to stop a shooter. We have seen some high-profile cases in which that happened. But the bulk of the findings, from news investigations to the FBI’s report to The Daily Show, suggest that this idea is often going to play out very differently than supporters like Trump and DeVos envision — and sometimes it could lead to more innocent people getting caught in the crossfire. If America wants to confront its gun-violence problem, then the research suggests it should look to reducing the number of guns in circulation — not putting more armed people into schools, and certainly not paying for more armed people in schools.",Betsy DeVos United States Secretary of Education Education Glasses 2019 college admissions bribery scandal  Boston College,"Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, is considering a plan to allow teachers to use more guns for teachers.","Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos is considering a new plan, according to the New York Times and Washington Post: Allow federal education funds to go toward putting more guns in schools.

(Chris Sweda / Chicago Tribune) Security issues have been brought to light at Mount Sinai Hospital in the wake of a drive-by shooting Saturday that injured two women outside the hospital. Police Sunday were still trying to untangle what happened about 8 p.m. Saturday as the two 35-year-old women gathered with a group who went to the hospital to visit their relative, a 25-year-old man who had been shot earlier that day. The shooting of the women prompted the hospital to be placed on lockdown for several hours. Amid security concerns, the hospital in March decided to build a 'fenced area’’ outside the emergency room to create a 'safe zone,’’ said a spokesman, Dan Regan. The 'safe zone' allows the security team to ensure proper security screenings and 'protect both patients and caregivers,' Regan said in a statement.

An ambulance driver enters a barred and gated enclosed area outside the emergency room entrance at Mount Sinai Medical Center on Sunday, May 6, 2018, in Chicago. (Stacey Wescott / Chicago Tribune) The 25-year-old man’s aunt, Amanda Morris, said hospital staff had not let the group inside the building so they gathered outside the private trauma center. While Morris’ nephew was undergoing surgery, a car pulled up alongside the hospital and began shooting into the group, Morris said. The shooters were in a dark-colored vehicle, police said. Three people in the car were wearing masks, said one woman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns. Morris recalled the shooters didn’t say anything before they opened fire. 'Nothing but gunfire,' Morris said. 'They just pulled up and started shooting.' One of the women shot outside the hospital is the sister of the man who was taken there after the earlier shooting, Morris said. The other woman is a cousin, she said. 'We are investigating whether the group was targeted due to their relation to the victim,' Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. No arrests have been made. Mount Sinai, on California Avenue at 15th Street in the city’s Douglas Park neighborhood, has for years had issues with disruptions outside the hospital when West Side shooting victims arrive, according to police reports. Emotional and rowdy crowds made up of friends, family members and sometimes gang members pushing their way into the emergency room is a 'real problem' for emergency room staff from intake clerks and security guards to doctors trying to perform procedures, according to a law enforcement source. 'It’s miserable for the hospital,’’ the source said, 'But they (crowds) don’t seem to care.’’ Hospital officials worked in consultation with the Chicago Police Department to create a 'safe zone' around the entrance and security screening area, which can get congested during busy periods, Regan said. Guglielmi could not confirm that. The new security area is like a vestibule, manned by the hospital guards and bookended by doors that can lock. The main lobby and waiting area were open at the time of the incident, Regan said. Those waiting outside the emergency department were invited to come into the hospital and wait in the main lobby, he said. It was unclear whether the two 35-year-old women had been inside the hospital at any time. The hospital’s visitor guidelines for trauma patients allow only immediate family members to visit in patient rooms or the emergency department. Extended family members may stay in the main waiting area, and access the cafeteria during normal visiting hours until 9 p.m. For now, the 'fencing’’ will be kept in tact, Regan said. In July, a 31-year-man was shot in the groin as he walked toward Mount Sinai Hospital during an especially violent weekend that saw 30 people shot, three fatally during an 18-hour period. It wasn't clear how close he was to the building, a hospital spokeswoman said at the time. The hospital 'immediately' went on lockdown after that incident. Saturday’s shooting outside Mount Sinai shows 'that the tragic effects of gun violence can impact us anywhere in the city, even outside former ‘safe zones’ like hospitals,' Regan said.

The campaign launching Wednesday, finds its way to television via public service announcements facilitated by the Ad Council, and aims to make the term ""family fire"" a household word as it describes accidental shootings of children and other family members in homes across the nation. ""Rather than mudslinging and name calling, we’re focusing on how can we act to keep our kids alive,"" said Kyleanne Hunter, a Brady Center vice president. ""And that might open the door to more discussion about how to end gun violence."" This foot-in-the-door strategy is composed of at least a year's worth of ""End Family Fire"" TV, digital and online ads that center on a conversation between an elementary-school aged boy and his father. The boy asks if a firearm is in the house, but he soon reveals that he knows where it's kept and that he could use it to confront a bully. ""But it is our gun,"" the boy says. ""In our home. Happens all the time."" The full-length spot concludes with the words, ""8 kids a day are accidentally killed or injured by FAMILY FIRE. FAMILY FIRE is a shooting involving an improperly stored gun."" Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha The Brady Center, citing U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, states that 4.6 million children live in homes with unlocked and loaded guns; three in four know where the guns are stored. So far, gun-owners' rights groups don't appear to be open to the Family Fire campaign. The National Rifle Association didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from NBC News. But Jordan Stein, director of communications for the organization Gun Owners of America said via email that locking up firearms is not a panacea for keeping children away from danger. ""Every death is tragic, but statistically speaking, more young children die choking on hotdogs than are killed accidentally by firearms,"" he said, supporting his argument with recent data from the CDC. ""So forcing every home to have their guns locked up will only make gun owners less safe. After all, when a criminal breaks into a person’s home, he’s not going to wait for the gun owner to unlock his firearm."" The Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the Ad Council, and Droga5 introduce new phrase and national PSAs to reduce the number of deaths and injuries resulting from unsecured or misused guns in the home. The Brady Campaign The timing of the ad blitz — there still has been no federal legislative action following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida Feb. 14 and following the Las Vegas massacre Oct. 1 — could also be seen by anti-gun activists as odd. Advocates for stricter rules for firearms owners are also grappling with hi-tech weapons, such as 3D printed guns and ""ghost guns"" made of untracable parts, that exist under the radar of law enforcement in most states. But Brady Center officials say the need to find compromise with the gun owners' rights contingent is urgent: without it, a fix for easy access to firearms on the part of criminals and mass shooters might never be addressed. ""In the gun violence conversation, gun owners were largely missing,"" Hunter said. Added Kris Brown, co-president of the organization, ""People are frustrated by the stalemate we have on both sides."" Keeping children away from guns should be a no-brainer, they argue, that everyone can get behind (even as comedian Sacha Baron Cohen trolled some Republicans to admit they embrace the idea that kids should be trained to use firearms). ""This is completely outside the realm of politics,"" Brown said. ""It's not red state, blue state — it’s families who want to do what’s best to protect the most vulnerable."" In fact the Family Fire campaign officially recommends simply that gun owners with firearms stored in homes where children live keep them ""secure"" and separate from ammunition. ""A simple gun lock can make a major difference,"" the campaign states on its website. Hunter said the campaign, which is supported by the groups Droga5, National Parent Teacher Association, Doctors for America, the DC Police Foundation and others, is ""in some ways"" akin to the harm reduction movement for drug users: If nothing can stop it, society might as well make it as safe as possible. But Hunter said the Brady Center likens it more to the campaign to stop drunken driving. ""We have to find a way to foster a more rich and common understanding about guns in this country that don’t cause people to go to the other side of the divide,"" Brown said. CLARIFICATION (Aug. 8, 2018, 4:54 p.m.): An earlier version of this article stated that the Brady Center's campaign is ""in some ways"" akin to the harm reduction movement for drug users.

Planned walkouts for the 19th anniversary of the Columbine shooting were canceled for the school district shortly after news of the incident spread. A school resource officer at Forest High School in Ocala, Florida, first heard what he believed to be a loud “bang” sound at 8:39 a.m., Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods told reporters in a briefing Friday. Nearly three minutes later, the officer located the shooter and was able to take him or her into custody. Woods did not say how the shooter was neutralized, though he added that the shooter offered little resistance. The officer also found a 17-year-old student shot in the ankle. Woods added that the victim’s injuries were non-life-threatening. There were no other injuries reported in this morning’s incident. LIVE Press Conference on Forest High School Shooting Posted by Marion County Sheriff's Office on Friday, April 20, 2018 Woods didn’t offer many additional details about the suspect, but did say it was a 19-year-old non-student. He did not say whether the shooter was a former student of the school, but said the shooting appeared to be “intentional.” The sheriff declined to identify the weapon used in the shooting. “Although we have come to a safe conclusion, it is still an investigation, and there’s a lot of details that we don’t know,” Woods said. In an initial update on Facebook, the Marion County Sheriff’s Office confirmed that the suspect was in custody and that the wounded student was being treated by medics.

The Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program does not specifically prohibit weapons purchases and would allow DeVos to decide which states or school districts could use the funding for guns and training, sources told The New York Times on Wednesday. The $1 billion student support program is intended to fund the country’s poorest schools, the newspaper noted, adding that funds are typically allocated toward improving education curriculum, school conditions or technology for digital literacy. ADVERTISEMENT The Education Department would likely approve the gun purchases under the goal of improving school conditions, the sources told the Times. Schools that would reportedly receive fund would be encouraged to increase mental health counseling, create dropout prevention programs and help students acclimate from the juvenile justice system. “The department is constantly considering and evaluating policy issues, particularly issues related to school safety,” Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, told the newspaper. “The secretary nor the department issues opinions on hypothetical scenarios.” The move would be a historic break of precedent from the longstanding federal government policy of not to paying for weapons inside schools, the newspaper noted. Congress passed a bipartisan school safety bill earlier this year that created a new grant program to help educate students and teachers about warning signs for gun violence. School safety became a national talking point after the school shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Santa Fe, Texas earlier this year.

Trump established the White House school safety commission in March to “study and make recommendations” on several topics, such as age restrictions for certain gun purchases.

(Reuters) - David Ortner adjusted his yarmulke, cocked his pistol and took aim - something he wishes a civilian had done to defend Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue three days ago when Robert Bowers walked in and shot 11 people dead. ""When this happens, you get a wake-up call,"" said Ortner, a 28-year-old owner of an optician shop in Monsey, New York. Ortner was one of nine Jewish men who attended a one-day course on Tuesday at the privately owned Cherev Gidon Israeli Tactical Defense Academy near Scranton, Pennsylvania, a class that was scheduled on Sunday in response to the Pittsburgh synagogue attack. He was there to learn how to use a gun to protect himself and his community and prevent a repeat of Saturday's massacre, the deadliest targeting Jewish people in U.S. history. ""The fact is, we're at war,"" said Yonatan Stern, a veteran officer of the Israel Defense Forces and director of the academy, told his class. ""We want every Jew in America armed."" In the six years since Stern started the academy, demand for firearms training had never been higher than after Saturday's attack. Hundreds of interested students contacted Stern in the last 72 hours. All but three or four were Jewish. The spike in demand follows President Donald Trump's statement that the shooting might have been prevented if the synagogue had employed an armed guard. But many Jews have resisted the idea that having guns in synagogues is the best way to prevent such attacks. Rabbi Moti Rieber, executive director of the Kansas Interfaith Action, an advocacy organization, said on Tuesday that he did not believe Trump’s call for more armed guards could prevent attacks on places of worship. “What kind of country we're going to be if every house of worship has to have an armed guard?” Rieber said. “I think having less access to that kind of weaponry is going to be much more effective in the long run than having a single armed guard.” Story continues According to Stern, an armed guard at a synagogue is a useful deterrent but not a replacement for armed civilians, since a shooter could kill the armed guard before entering and killing congregants. ""To wait for law enforcement to arrive simply is not the answer,"" Stern said. Some of the students attending the course were card-carrying National Rifle Association members. Some had never fired a gun before. Two worked in schools and wanted to defend Jewish children. Many of them intended to bring guns to their synagogues on the next Sabbath for protection. ""Everybody has to find a way to react; this is my way,"" said Zev Guttman, who said he was scared of guns until Saturday's shooting convinced him he had to be armed. Tuesday's course, held in a log cabin on an outdoor shooting range in rural Honesdale, about 300 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, consisted of active-shooter response drills using handguns and rifles. Students practiced drawing concealed weapons, loading and firing AR-15 rifles at bulls-eye targets. Stern said that it ""touches my heart"" to see his students in training because he knows they will return to their synagogues as a first line of defense.

The plan was announced nearly two weeks after a 17-year-old armed with a shotgun and pistol killed 10 students and educators at Santa Fe High School in the Houston area. It followed a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, in February in which 17 people, mostly students, were massacred. ""Everybody in this entire process and everybody in the state of Texas never wants to see another occasion where innocent students are gunned down in their own schools,"" Abbott told a news conference in Dallas on Wednesday. The proposed funding works out to about $20 per student in a state that has about 5.5 million students enrolled in its public schools. The 40-point plan, which followed meetings last week between Abbott and education and law enforcement officials, calls for enhanced mental health resources for students and new metal detectors for extra security at schools, Abbott said in a statement. The Texas Democratic Party issued a statement condemning the governor's plan, claiming that he failed to directly address gun crimes that occur in the United States. ""Nothing in Abbott's plans address the reality that it is too easy for a weapon to end up in the hands of someone wanting to cause harm,"" Texas Democratic Party chair Gilberto Hinojosa said in a statement. Abbott is an ardent defender of the right to bear arms under the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Soon after the shooting at Santa Fe High School he said that any proposed legal changes that he would consider to improve school safety would ""protect Second Amendment rights."" His proposals include eliminating a rule that requires some school marshals to store their weapons in a safe while on campus. Abbott said he would ask lawmakers to consider legislation to allow law enforcement, families, school staff or a district attorney to file a petition seeking the removal of firearms from a potentially dangerous person only after legal due process was provided.

33,33,265,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-parkland-shooting-report-20180803-story.html,"Florida school failed Parkland shooter, report says","The Broward school district mishandled the case of student Nikolas Cruz when he asked for special help, long before he killed 17 staff and students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to a long-awaited report released Friday. For the first time, the report revealed that Cruz had asked to return to the district’s special education program, which would have provided him more support than he received as a general student, the report says. The report, by the Collaborative Educational Network of Tallahassee, found that the school district largely followed the policies and laws in place when educating Cruz, but failed on two occasions. Exactly how is not clear. Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer ruled Friday that the 46-page report could be released to the public, but much of the content was blacked out, apparently including any details that would explain the district’s mistakes. The Broward school district recommended the report be altered to comply with the shooter’s educational and medical privacy rights. Advertisement Of the report’s 1,707 lines, 1,078 of them — or about 64% — are concealed. After rejecting special education, Cruz quickly failed. Three days after he was forced by the district to withdraw from the Parkland school, he purchased an AR-15. A year after his ejection, he returned and gunned down 14 students and three adults. Cruz’s attorneys argued unsuccessfully in court that the report would hinder his right to a fair trial. Scherer agreed with attorneys for the South Florida Sun Sentinel and other media outlets, who argued the taxpayer-funded report should not be hidden from view. In a written statement, Broward Schools Supt. Robert Runcie said he looked forward to releasing the full report “as soon as it is legally appropriate.” He said the review shows that the district’s “systems are appropriate” and that the district worked consistently “to provide an education and ongoing, changing behavioral care for Cruz throughout his time in the Broward school system.” Advertisement The report, however, suggests the district did not follow laws or policies in place when school employees tried to transfer Cruz, then a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, to a special education campus. Cruz, then 18, refused and removed himself from the special education program. Runcie has said that when Cruz made that decision, the district was unable to help him with special education services. But the consultant’s report reveals for the first time that Cruz later “requested reinstatement” of special education services, and the district mishandled his request. The revelation bolsters criticism from some special education experts, who said the district should have done more for Cruz, who had emotional and behavioral problems. Advertisement Cruz’s attorneys said the $60,000 report is a “whitewash” commissioned by the school district to clear it of responsibility for how it handled Cruz’s complex psychological problems. “I think that the report is an attempt by the school board to absolve itself of any liability or responsibility for all the missed opportunities that they had in this matter,” said Gordon Weekes, the chief assistant public defender. The consultant, however, found that the district largely handled Cruz properly, over 16 years of education. “With isolated exceptions, the district adhered to procedural and substantive requirements,” the report says. Advertisement Without directly criticizing the school district, the consultant recommended the district reconsider how to handle cases like Cruz’s, where a “high-needs” special education student decides against participating in special education and then reverses the decision. The report suggests that when Cruz was a general education student, he wasn’t offered access to counseling and mental health services that are available to all students.

Andrew Cuomo. In a lawsuit, the NRA alleges that Cuomo and state regulators are seeking to “deprive the NRA and its constituents of their First Amendment rights to speak freely about gun-related issues and defend the Second Amendment.” At issue is a campaign by the Democratic governor to discourage insurance companies and financial firms from working with the NRA. The NRA claims that what it describes as New York’s “blacklisting” would “imminently” deprive it of basic banking and other financial services “essential to the NRA’s corporate existence and its advocacy mission.” In its court filing, the NRA said that Cuomo and state regulators “seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional-rights advocates,” adding that “if their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed.” Cuomo scoffed at the NRA’s lawsuit on Friday. “New York will not be intimidated by the NRA’s frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda,” he said. The state is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit with New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood downplaying the group’s concerns. Although Underwood acknowledged that Cuomo and the NRA have a “longstanding history of strong disagreement” on gun control, she said the lawsuit did not allege that New York “directly inhibited the NRA from expressing its opposition to gun regulation. Instead, it presents a speculative and implausible ‘parade of horribles’.” Twitter users, for their part, knew exactly how to respond to the NRA’s tale of woe: “Thoughts and prayers.” Twitter was suddenly filled with well-wishers for the organization who repeated what has become the cliché phrase that gun advocates use whenever there is a mass shooting.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. LOS ANGELES — Business is so good at online retailer Ghost Gunner that it's sold out of its most popular items: key pieces for homemade assault-style rifles — known as ""ghost guns"" — which exist under the radar of law enforcement. The ""80 percent lower receiver"" parts are so named because they fall just short of meeting the federal definition of being guns unto themselves. They can easily be shaped and fastened into full-fledged killing machines. But those who want to use Ghost Gunner's popular CNC (computer numeric control) tool to do this will have to wait: it's sold out, too. The future of firearms — 3D-printed weapons and ghost guns — have officials so alarmed they're calling for stricter regulation. Both types lack serial numbers that would enable law enforcement to track them, and both are available in plastic, which can bypass metal detectors, especially if certain parts like firing pins are removed. The National Rifle Association says fear of plastic guns is overblown because they were outlawed from coast to coast by the Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988. Ghost guns made with metal parts purchased online, however, remain legal in most of the country. When guns are in the news, business is good, Cody Wilson, the man behind Austin, Texas-based Defense Distributed, told NBC News in a recent interview. ""Every time there’s a big national stink,"" he says, ""we sell out."" Travis Lerol holds an AR-15 assault rifle along with a rifle's lower receiver made of plastic that was constructed by his 3D printer at his home in 2012. Jahi Chikwendiu / The Washington Post/Getty Images file Wilson has been getting attention because the U.S. State Department recently agreed to end its prohibition of his online publication of blueprints that allow anyone to make an untraceable firearm from scratch using a 3D printer. A federal judge on Tuesday, however, granted a request for a temporary restraining order that prevents Wilson from publishing the plans for how to make the untraceable guns. “In a major victory for common sense and public safety, a federal judge just granted our request for a nationwide temporary restraining order — blocking the Trump administration from allowing the distribution of materials to easily 3-D print guns,"" said New York Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood, who was part of a coalition of nine states suing over the firearms instructions. But a coalition of gun rights groups created a website and posted similar gun blueprints later Tuesday night, seemingly in protest against the judge's ruling. President Donald Trump tweeted Tuesday that he is ""looking into 3D Plastic Guns being sold to the public"" and noted that he had ""already spoke to NRA."" Attorneys general from 20 states had formally urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Jeff Sessions Monday to reverse course and ban publishing of the instructions. Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer, co-chair of the group Prosecutors Against Gun Violence, says 3D-printed guns, like ghost guns, will be embraced by felons unable to legally obtain firearms in California. Publishing the blueprints ""would allow people who can’t get guns to download them and evade detection,"" he said. Separately, ghost guns — the unmarked, unregistered result of those ""80 percent"" parts widely available online — made headlines in July when authorities busted an alleged firearms ring in Los Angeles. The day after Independence Day, officials in L.A. announced that a confidential informant and an undercover federal agent had purchased 20 assault rifle ghost guns from a pair of suspects who now face allegations of unlawfully manufacturing and trafficking weapons, according to a criminal complaint. The alleged sellers, Julio Herrera, 27, and Raychelle Hernandez, 26, were part of a gang-connected ring that sold completed ghost guns to associates in Hollywood, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Los Angeles Police Department. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha Ghost gun parts have been available on the internet throughout most of the decade, but authorities say they're increasingly coming across gang members and felons in possession of resulting firearms. Federal law hasn't kept up with the online availability of these parts, and attempts to pass new legislation in Congress have been unsuccessful. ""This is an emerging trend that is just continuing to increase,"" Bill McMullan, special agent in charge of the ATF’s Los Angeles office, said during a press conference announcing the July bust. ""Criminals are making their own weapons because they’re not able to buy them legally."" Homemade AR-15 type rifles were used in a northern California mass shooting last year and in a rampage at Santa Monica College in 2013, but authorities fear they could do even more damage if they become a staple of the street. ""For the ATF it sometimes makes things a little more challenging when gang members are getting around the laws and trying to find ways to get their hands on guns and creating more violence in their communities,"" McMullan later told NBC News. He said he believes that ghost guns are a problem across the nation but that agents are coming across them more in states, like California, ""that have stricter gun laws."" Ghost guns are also finding their way to Mexican drug cartels, according to a 2016 report from the Government Accountability Office. ""It's international now,"" said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which lobbies for stricter firearms control. ""There’s a huge, dangerous underbelly of the gun industry operating online."" Also in July, New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal sent cease-and-desist letters to online firms that sell ""partially-built firearms"" in the Garden State, warning that the selling of parts that could make an assault rifle is outlawed there. ""These weapons are illegal in our state,"" he wrote.

The clip of the segment can be viewed here. ""I do not know how to tie my shoelaces, but please can I have a semiautomatic gun?"" Cohen had the toy, called Fizzy Fireworks, ask Brewer.

""A certain kind of machine gun, you can,"" Brewer replies. ""Certain kinds of machine guns are off-grounds. They ought not to be, though."" Cohen, the comedian who made the movies Borat and Bruno, explained to Brewer that the toy was 21 years old but had the mental age of a 3-year-old. Brewer then told Cohen and the toy that most people were not mentally ill. ""I'm not mentally ill, I just want to ethnically cleanse all of the limited-edition Shopkins,"" Cohen made Fizzy Fireworks say. ""Well, that's crazy,"" Brewer replied. When Cohen makes the toy ask Brewer if it could still buy a gun despite telling her its plans, she says it still can purchase the weapon. ""Oh, but can I still buy machine gun, please?"" Cohen makes the toy ask. ""Yes, you can,"" Brewer says. Newsweek reached out to Brewer for comment but did not hear back in time for publication. Brewer is the latest politician to be duped while appearing on Cohen's show, which premiered on Showtime in July. In past episodes, Cohen tricked Roy Moore by scanning a fake pedophile-detecting device over him. The defeated Republican candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct, was interviewed by Cohen's character, General Erran Morad, an Israeli anti-terror expert, who used fake ""Israel technology"" to prove that neither he nor Moore were pedophiles. The scanner, which looked like a metal detector, did not beep when waved over Cohen's character, but made a noise when it was used over Moore.

The NRA and its lobbying arm spent $30 million in the 2016 election to support Trump. A spokesman for the gun rights group declined to comment to Politico about the FEC probe.

While the FEC declined to confirm to Politico that it had opened a preliminary probe, it reportedly sent confirmation to ADLF treasurer Brad Woodhouse. In its current stage, the investigation will likely require the NRA to provide the FEC with its campaign finance records from 2016 onwards.

It backfired, and the teaching assistant has been reassigned to other duties for the remainder of the semester. University policy, as well as state law, permits students to carry firearms on campus so long as they are properly and legally licensed to do so. What are the details? The unnamed teaching assistant reportedly attempted to create a safe space in the classroom for those who oppose guns by figuratively quarantining those weapon-carrying students in a taped-off area without any desks. Campus Reform reported that the area was about 3 feet by 3 feet, and did not contain a desk because ""desks are reserved for students who respect the personal and psychological safety of their classmates and instructor."" The university reacted swiftly when the issue was brought to their attention and quashed the notion of a ""Second Amendment zone"" in the classroom or anywhere on campus. A Facebook post by Utah state Rep. Karianne Lisonbee revealed the document that the teaching assistant reportedly created. In an earlier iteration of the post, Lisbonee wrote, ""I am livid. A University of Utah Professor doesn't understand the Bill of Rights and University policy on free speech - which is disturbing enough. But even more egregious, she is seeking to break state law and deprive students of their rights. Please share."" When the story began to pick up traction, and was addressed by school administration, Lisbonee added, ""Update: Great news! I have been assured that this teacher has been reprimanded for publishing a syllabus against University policy. She was asked and has issued an apology to her students. Her syllabus has been retracted by the University and they are committed to making sure that she receives proper training. Thank you to the University and to the brave students who raised this issue. The price of liberty is constant vigilance. Please share!"" The full document read: Concealed carry is protected under your second amendment rights!

This zone also does not include a desk, because desks are reserved for students who respect the personal and psychological safety of their classmates and instructor. What did the college say? A spokesperson for the school told Campus Reform in a statement that the teaching assistant's policy has been removed from the syllabus. “University of Utah officials recently learned that a graduate teaching assistant included a statement in an undergraduate course syllabus that violated both state law and university policy. The statement has been removed from the syllabus and students in the class have been alerted to the error,” the university spokesperson said. “The graduate student instructor has apologized and has received additional training about the university's policies,” the statement continued, and added that the teaching assistant “will not teach this semester and will instead have other assignments” instead. “The approval of course syllabuses is handled by individual departments, and syllabuses are expected to comply with all university policies,” the statement concluded.",The University of Utah   Guren no Yumiya  Crimson Bow and Arrow Second Amendment Zone Teacher Epica,A “Jon-BJohn gun” on campus.,"A teaching assistant at the University of Utah is under fire for attempting to create a ""Second Amendment zone,"" which was intended to segregate gun carriers from the rest of the class population.

According to the transcript of the interrogation, detective John Curcio offered him a glass of water. ""I do not deserve it,"" Cruz remarked. When the officer briefly left the room to look for water anyway, Cruz said to himself: ""Kill me, just kill me."" Then he told the detective that demons in his head -- which had started tormenting him years earlier -- told him to ""buy weapons, kill animals and destroy everything."" ""What are the demons?"" the detective asked. ""The voices,"" Cruz said. ""The evil side"". ""What does your voice say to you?"" Curcio asked. ""Burn. Kill. Destroy,"" he replied. Cruz said he had attempted suicide two months before the attack -- after his mother's death in November 2017 -- with an overdose of the painkiller Ibuprofen. Two years before that episode, he tried and failed to commit suicide by alcohol poisoning. Cruz said that he was depressed by his lack of friends and his loneliness. When the detective asked him why he had decided to buy a semiautomatic rifle -- an AR-15 -- the one he allegedly used in the massacre, he replied: ""Because it looks 'cool.'"" Cruz bought the rifle legally. The transcript was released on Monday after the judge in charge of the case, Elizabeth Scherer, approved a motion presented by the Miami Herald and Sun Sentinel, among other media, arguing the public had a right to know its contents.

The nation's largest sporting goods retailer said sales fell at stores open for at least a year. The decline was worse than analysts expected, and the stock fell around 7% Wednesday morning. Dick's (DKS) placed the blame squarely on Under Armour (UA): ""We experienced continued significant declines in Under Armour sales as a result of their decision to expand distribution,"" CEO Edward Stack said in a release. Fissure with Under Armour Under Armour has started to sell more at department stores like Kohl's (KSS) and Macy's (M) as the brand tries to break out of a slump and reach more middle-income shoppers. Kohl's has said Under Armour's sales have surged since the expanded partnership began. But that left Dick's in a bind. At Dick's stores, Under Armour clothes and sneakers are usually placed in the back and are not much different than the merchandise Kohl's sells, noted Jane Hali, the CEO of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates. The tension with Under Armour reflects how closely Dick's fortunes are tied to the success of vendors and their own distribution strategies. Under Armour dropped 4% during early Wednesday trading as investors worried about its relationship with Dick's. Gun question Dick's policy on guns had little impact on its results last quarter. After the deadly February high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, Dick's announced it would stop selling assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines. It also raised the minimum age for gun sales to 21. Last quarter, Dick's stock surged 27% after it reported a big jump in online sales and stemmed in-store losses. Dick's even said in its latest annual filing that customer demand for firearms and hunting merchandise had been weak, leading to sluggish sales. ""Dick's disappointing earnings are not about their ban on assault rifle sales or any of their other social stances,"" said Bob Phibbs, CEO of the consulting firm Retail Doctor. What's working at Dick's Despite a weak spot in Under Armour, Dick's has strengthened other areas of its business. It has also benefited from a changing sports retail environment. Dick's has been taking advantage of the collapse of Sports Authority and Golfsmith. ""The sporting goods industry is experiencing consolidation as competitor bankruptcies are leaving behind significant market share,"" Dick's said in the annual filing. Online sales, athletic clothes, and Dick's exclusive brands like CALIA by Carrie Underwood and Reebok posted double-digit increases last quarter. Dick's moves to sharpen its focus on digital growth and private labels are paying off. Another positive sign: Dick's inventory level shrunk last quarter. That means it is making smart merchandise decisions and avoiding getting caught carrying too much stuff. The retailer is currently going through a broad strategy change. It is opening fewer stores a year and investing more money in improving online delivery speed and offering better prices. It used to outsource its website to third-party providers, but took control of digital operations last year. Dick's long game Dick's believes it can leverage its reputation and experience selling sporting goods to create an in-store experience athletes and sportswear shoppers can't find at big box retailers or online. Dick's is trying to become a place customers go with questions about which baseball bat or basketball shoe to buy. For example, it has invested in little league and youth sports sponsorships as a way to ""stay top-of-mind for athletes and their families."" It also wants to improve its selection of higher-margin white-label brands to differentiate itself. Phibbs, however, believes Dick's is falling short of helping shoppers make decisions about sports equipment. ""Dick's isn't investing in the customer experience,"" he said. ""They are leaving money on the table when customers walk into their stores and don't receive the help they need."" Continuing to invest in low prices and improving stores will become key for Dick's in the coming months as it attempts to stand out in a crowded retail landscape. A looming danger: Nike, Dick's largest customer, is overhauling its business model. It is selling more of its sneakers and clothes through its own apps and stores, rather than relying on retailers.",Dick's Sporting Goods  Retail Sports  Sporting Goods   Modell's Sporting Goods Sports Authority,A Dick’s Sporting Goods store in New York.

1,1,10073,https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-shooter-troubled-loner-white-supremacist-ties-213321497.html,Florida shooter a troubled loner with white supremacist ties,"Parkland (Etats-Unis) (AFP) - Nikolas Cruz was expelled from school, threatened fellow students and posted ""very disturbing"" messages on social media, along with pictures of his favorite guns. But despite broad signs suggesting he was a deeply troubled young man, Cruz was able to return to his Parkland, Florida high school Wednesday with an assault rifle and open fire, killing 17 students and adults. A mugshot of Cruz, released after his arrest, depicts a young man seemingly little different from any other 19-year-old -- cleanly-cut chestnut hair, hazel eyes, his face speckled with freckles. But the information emerging since his attack suggests there were red flags that should have set off danger alerts. Fellow students knew he posted violent messages on line. And someone using the same name had published a comment on YouTube last year saying: ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" That was reported to the FBI, but they never traced it back to Cruz. Cruz had also joined the white supremacist group Republic of Florida, participating in their paramilitary training exercises, a member of the group told US media. And Broward County Mayor Beam Furr said he had been treated for a time at a mental health clinic, though he had not been back for over a year. - 'A lot of problems' - Cruz arrived Wednesday afternoon at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in a sprawling Florida suburb north of Miami just before school let out, opening fire with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle originally designed for combat. Before he was expelled last year, he had a reputation among the 3,000-strong student body as ""weird"" and ""threatening,"" according to students and teachers. ""I met him last year, he was in my class at the beginning of the year and when I first met him I knew that something was off about him and he was kind of weird,"" Manolo Alvarez, 17, told AFP. ""People would bully him once in a while and spread rumors about him, like he was planning a school shooting, and nobody believed it. We thought it was just rumors until sadly it actually happened,"" Alvarez said. Story continues Dakota Mutchler, 17, told the Washington Post he began selling knives in school out of his lunchbox, and posted on Instagram about his guns and about killing animals. His interest in guns wouldn't have been extraordinary. He had been a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, a government high school program that provides preparatory training for the military, including marksmanship. But his behavior eventually gave rise to strong concerns from the school administration. According to another pupil, Nicholas Coke, Cruz had ""a lot of problems,"" recalling an incident during middle school when Cruz kicked out a window. - 'They didn't see this coming ' - Jim Gard, a math teacher who had taught Cruz for a semester in 2016, told the Miami Herald that teachers were notified he had been expelled, and could not be permitted back on school grounds with a backpack. ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus."" He clearly had a difficult childhood. Cruz was given up for adoption at birth in September 1998, along with a brother. The adoptive parents were a couple in their 50s, according to the Sun Sentinel, the local newspaper. His father died when he was still young, while his mother passed away last November, leaving the boys in the care of a family friend, according to the Sentinel. Neighbors said he got in trouble repeatedly for minor incidents as he grew up, and that police were called a number of times, the Sentinel reported. One said he was seen shooting another neighbor's chickens. When he moved in with another family after his mother died, they kept his legally owned AR-15 locked in a cabinet, though Cruz had a key, according to Jim Lewis, the family's attorney. ""The family is devastated, they didn't see this coming,"" Lewis said, according to the Sentinel. ""He was a little quirky and he was depressed about his mom's death, but who wouldn't be?""",Nikolas Cruz Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School School shooting Shooting Murder Mass shooting AR-15 style rifle Suspect Student,"A photograph of the suspect, Nikolas Cruz.","Parkland (Etats-Unis) (AFP) - Nikolas Cruz was expelled from school, threatened fellow students and posted ""very disturbing"" messages on social media, along with pictures of his favorite guns.","nikolas cruz was expelled from school after being expelled from high school for a year. despite broad signs suggesting he was a troubled young man, he was able to return to his parkland, florida high school with an assault rifle and open fire. the information emerging since his attack suggests there were red flags that should have set off danger alerts, fellow students knew he posted violent messages",1,1,4,6,1,0,1,0.0,7,0

1051,1051,382,http://us.cnn.com/2018/08/15/health/school-design-era-mass-shootings-trnd/index.html,How to design a school in the era of mass shootings,"(CNN) For school designers and architects, the current debate about how to make schools safer focuses too much on add-on measures. Metal detectors? More resource officers? Armed teachers? Bulletproof backpacks? These security steps, whether effective or not, don't address the fundamental way that a school works or how people move through it. They also must be balanced with the need to create an environment where kids feel inspired and energized to learn. As students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and across the country return to classes this week, CNN spoke to designers, architects and security experts to answer a sobering question: How do you design a school in the age of the mass shooting? Their answers, which follow a theory known as Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design, illuminate the delicate balance between security and education. ""It should be inspiring space. It should be lit with daylight. It should be a place where everyone feels welcome,"" said Sue Pruchnicki, principal at Bond Architects, a St. Louis firm that has designed many new schools. ""Our task is to make it safer without making it look like a fortress."" Perimeter landscaping that makes visitors visible The entrance to this middle school, designed by PBK/IN2 Architecture, includes large glass windows, protective poles and an entrance clearly outlined in red. One main idea of designing safety is to create several layers of security, or concentric rings of access, starting with the perimeter and then working inward into the school. If there is an intruder, each layer of security is designed to delay him or her until first responders can arrive. The outermost layer of security is the landscape leading up to the entrance. Designers said they try to create a perimeter where everyone has to walk up on foot, so that people inside the school can easily see who is coming. ""Folks have to come up on a pedestrian level,"" said Art Bond, principal of Bond Architects. In practice, that means the area around the entrance might have a pathway through a low shrubbery or a garden, so that there are no places to hide. Some schools might have a pedestrian bridge out front to funnel visitors to that main entrance. In addition, visitor parking lots and bus dropoffs are located in separate areas further from the school entrance, so visitors have to walk to the entrance. Bollards or strategically placed planters near the entrance can also be used to prevent someone driving into the building. ""We want to make sure that we have lots of windows so that administrators, people that are in charge, can see folks approaching the building,"" said Bill Payne, CEO of architecture and design firm Fanning Howey. A single entrance point At an elementary school in Zanesville, Ohio, visitors enter an enclosed vestibule connected to the front office when they walk into the school. After the shooting at Santa Fe High School in May, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick blamed the shooting on ""too many entrances and too many exits"" at the school. The comment was mocked by some as "" door control ,"" but he was making a real point: Many new schools are now built with a single, primary entrance that all students, teachers and visitors must come through. ""In design, what we want to make sure is that we can visually observe anybody that approaches the building and then pass them through a filtering process,"" Payne explained. The idea is to have a better way to control who visits the schools and, in the case of an emergency, to create an additional barrier to anyone seeking to do harm. Architects are designing schools where visitors encounter a single entrance point in a vestibule or antechamber. The visitors then must talk to an administrator or secretary to present their ID and reason for being there, and only then are they allowed to pass through another set of doors to get into the school. For example, the firm Fanning Howey built the West Muskingum Learning Center in Zanesville, Ohio with a vestibule that leads visitors to a front office. Ken Trump, the president of National School Safety and Security Services, said the vestibules help with what's called ""visitor management."" ""You reconfigure the front entrance way of the school, so instead of being able to just walk right in to the school, you get funneled to the office to get checked in,"" he said. These vestibule doors are generally left open during the morning and afternoon rush and then closed once classes begin. There are also many one-way exits around the school that can be opened in case of a fire or other emergency. ""One way in, multiple ways out,"" Payne said. Reinforced doors Visitors to an elementary school in St. Louis County must first enter a secure vestibule with a bankteller-like glass window. This vestibule, renovated in 2017, has glass that is protected by security glazing. During the Sandy Hook shooting, the gunman used an assault weapon to shoot through the vestibule glass and enter the building. With that in mind, some schools are strengthening the glass and reinforcing the doors of their entrances to make the school a ""harder"" target for any intruder. That has become a robust market for some businesses. Total Security Solutions is a company that designs, plans and produces bullet resistant barriers for schools -- but in a way that keeps the doors from looking too intimidating. ""We try to do that in a way that blends into the architecture, something that's visually pleasing, that doesn't look like Fort Knox or prison,"" said Rick Reid, market segment leader with Total Security Solutions. Reinforcing every single door in the school isn't tenable or cost effective, he said. Total Security Solutions mainly works to reinforce the vestibule at the single entrance point of the school. Other designers add a security film to the glass in the vestibule entrance with the idea of slowing down an intruder. The security film, although not bulletproof, keeps the glass in its frame like a car windshield, so intruders can't simply shatter the glass and walk right into the school. ""It's gonna take them longer to (enter), and by then, hopefully someone notices and somebody puts the building in lockdown so that police can be on their way,"" said Irene Nigaglioni, president of IN2 Architecture. The vestibules and hardened doors can also host metal detectors. However, their use remains a fraught issue among designers and security experts who say metal detectors may not be helpful in stopping an intruder and create unintended consequences, such as logjams. More importantly, they say, metal detectors send the wrong message to students. ""To me, there's a very negative message that is sent when you walk into your school building through metal detectors,"" Nigaglioni said. ""It just doesn't send that (message of) 'This is a safe and welcoming place' that you need to learn."" Wider, open hallways Hallways at new schools are designed to be open, collaborative spaces with clear lines of sight so that teachers and school administrators can observe. New schools also are being designed with wide, open hallways that provide clear lines of sight. This gives teachers, administrators and school resource officers the ability to stand at one spot and see what's going on all around. Having open hallways without nooks and crannies also gives surveillance cameras a fuller view of the school. In modern schools, these hallways function as throughways as well as collaborative working spaces similar to a Starbucks, Nigaglioni said. These open hallways also can be sealed off electronically in the case of an emergency, adding one more layer of security. In a lockdown, students would go to their classrooms and lock that door, too, creating yet another barrier. The overall idea is to create a collaborative learning environment that can function as another zone of security to allow time for police to arrive. The doors that separate this wing of the school from the main building can be electronically closed in a lockdown situation. ""That hardened approach, where everybody's in enclosed little silos, is not what we're attempting to do,"" Payne said. ""We're more interested in keeping the perpetrator or attacker at bay so the first responders can arrive in time."" Pruchnicki, of Bond Architects, said that classrooms are now labeled with large numbers that jut out from the wall. That makes it easier for first responders -- not to mention new students or substitute teachers -- to quickly locate a specific room on the school's campus. Of course, school security is much more than just the threat of active shootings. Schools also have to deal with bullying, sexual assaults, weather emergencies and estranged parents -- say, in a custody battle -- who may want to pull their kids out of school. The newest school designs have multiple focuses to address all of these issues. ""On a day-to-day basis, you want to design schools and focus on things that will help with monitoring, with supervision and communication, dealing with bullying prevention and those types of issues,"" Trump said. ""They go beyond just the tunnel vision focus on a shooter.""",Child Individualized Education Program School Indiana Student Education Learning disability Teacher Parent Job,"A student at the school in Parkland, Fla., which was designed by Art Bond, a firm that has designed many new schools.","(CNN) For school designers and architects , the current debate about how to make schools safer focuses too much on add-on measures.

Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Related: A judge has ordered the release of security footage from the Florida school shooting The school’s principal sent an apology letter to the school's teachers afterward. “I just wanted to again apologize to anyone who felt unnerved, distraught, disturbed or bothered by some of the Lock Down presentation held on Friday …It was not our aim to upset or intimidate anyone, especially with the graphic video from the Columbine High School mass shooting,” said Principal Dwayne Jones in the letter. The principal also said that he felt the video was necessary training in the event of an active shooter incident at the school. “However, the goal was to hopefully get everyone in the mindset that situations like Columbine and other school shootings are prevalent and relevant in our society today and that the safety of all should be the number one goal for all of us,” said Jones. REUTERS The Columbine shooting took place at a Colorado high school in 1999. Two shooters there killed 13 people in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history and one of the most high-profile in recent history. There have since been several other large school shootings. In 2007, a shooting at Virginia Tech left 32 people dead, and a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, killed 26 people, many of them small children. The training in Maryland comes in the wake of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month, where 17 students and faculty were killed. Schools across the country are grappling with what to do in the event of an attack and how to prevent it. On Sunday, the White House announced a school safety plan that included arming teachers. No major national gun legislation has been passed since the massacre at Sandy Hook, but there have been dozen efforts to curb gun violence at the state level.​""",Columbine High School Columbine High School massacre Stoneman Douglas High School shooting School shooting Eric Harris e Dylan Klebold Mass shooting Massacre Shooting Mass murder Murder,"A photograph of the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 1999.","""The lockdown presentation happened Friday at Laurel High School, about 20 miles outside of Washington, D.C. “Some people were upset.

610,610,271,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-posting-of-online-plans-for-3d-printed-guns/,Judge blocks posting of online plans for 3D printed guns,"A U.S. judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration Monday from allowing a Texas company to post online plans for making untraceable 3D guns, agreeing with 19 states and the District of Columbia that such access to the plastic guns would pose a security risk. The states sued to stop an agreement that the government had reached with Austin, Texas-based Defense Distributed, saying guidelines on how to print undetectable plastic guns could be acquired by felons or terrorists. U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik extended a temporary restraining order, and his new decision will last until the case is resolved. He said Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed, wanted to post the plans online so that citizens can arm themselves without having to deal with licenses, serial numbers and registrations. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Wilson has said that ""governments should live in fear of their citizenry."" ""It is the untraceable and undetectable nature of these small firearms that poses a unique danger,"" Lasnik said. ""Promising to detect the undetectable while at the same time removing a significant regulatory hurdle to the proliferation of these weapons - both domestically and internationally - rings hollow and in no way ameliorates, much less avoids, the harms that are likely to befall the states if an injunction is not issued."" The State Department had reached the settlement with the company after the agency removed the 3D gun-making plans from a list of weapons or technical data that cannot be exported overseas. The states argued that the federal agency didn't follow the law when it removed 3D guns from the munitions list. They said the government was supposed to notify Congress and provide a 30-day window before making a change to that list, but it did not. Lasnik criticized the government for switching its position on the threat posed by the 3D gun-making plans. Up until April, the government argued the distribution of the guidelines ""posed a threat to world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States,"" the judge said. Despite those fears, the government decided that it only needed to restrict the international availability of firearms up to .50 caliber. That's when they reached a settlement with the 3D gun company. There was no indication the government evaluated the unique characteristics of the plastic guns when it considered deleting that category of weapons from the prohibited list, the judge said. ""Nor is there any reasoned explanation for its change in position,"" Lasnik said. The federal government declined to comment on the judge's ruling. A lawyer with the U.S. Justice Department had argued against the injunction, saying possessing 3D plastic guns is already against the law, and the federal government is committed to enforcing that law. But the judge said it wasn't enough. ""While the court appreciates the earnestness with which this commitment was made at oral argument, it is of small comfort to know that, once an undetectable firearm has been used to kill a citizen of Delaware or Rhode Island or Vermont, the federal government will seek to prosecute a weapons charge in federal court while the state pursues a murder conviction in state court,"" Lasnik said. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson praised the ruling. ""Once again, I'm glad we put a stop to this dangerous policy,"" Ferguson said. ""But I have to ask a simple question: Why is the Trump administration working so hard to allow these untraceable, undetectable 3D-printed guns to be available to domestic abusers, felons and terrorists?"" The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun control group that has aggressively fought the online release of the gun plans, praised the judge's ruling ""as a tremendous victory for the American public."" Avery Gardiner, co-president of the group, said 3D-printed guns ""represent a supreme threat to our safety and security, and we are grateful that Judge Lasnik recognized it as such.""

881,881,22,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/kansas-man-sentenced-to-life-in-prison-for-2017-shooting-that-targeted-indian-men,Kansas man sentenced to life in prison for 2017 shooting that targeted Indian men,"A white man who fatally shot Indian national Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounded two other men at a restaurant in northeastern Kansas last year has been sentenced to life in prison, federal prosecutors announced Tuesday. Witnesses said the gunman, Adam Purinton, angrily confronted Kuchibhotla and another Indian national Alok Madasani at an Austin’s Bar & Grill in Olathe, Kansas, yelling “Get out of my country!” Purinton then shot eight rounds inside the restaurant, killing Kuchibhotla and wounding his friend Madasani. A third man, identified as Kansas resident Ian Grillot, was also shot after he tried to stop Purinton outside the bar. Before shooting, Purinton reportedly asked the men, who he thought were Iranian, about their immigration status. When he was located by police, at a bar more than 80 miles away from the crime scene, he told officers he had killed “two Middle Eastern men.” In May, Purinton agreed to a plea deal that recommended the maximum sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for the hate crime and firearm offenses against him. In turn, prosecutors agreed to not pursue a death sentence. “No matter who you are, what you believe, or how you worship, you should be able to live without fear of becoming a victim of hate crimes, We hope today’s sentencing brings some closure for the victims and their families,” U.S. Attorney Stephen McAllister for the District of Kansas said Tuesday in a statement. The new sentence comes on top of a separate life sentence given to Purinton after he pleaded guilty to state charges of murder and attempted murder. All the counts are to be served consecutively, according to court documents. Here’s what else we know. Prosecutors have pointed to an earlier incident weeks before the shooting In its statement today, the Justice Department said that Purinton “admitted in open court” at his federal guilty-plea hearing months ago “that he targeted and shot Kuchibhotla and Madasani because of their race, color, and national origin.” In a statement from the department in May, prosecutors also pointed to a separate incident weeks before the shooting. Purinton happened to be at Austin’s Bar & Grill at the same time as Kuchibhotla and Madasani, sitting by himself in the bar area while the two Indian men were having a drink on the patio. All three were known to frequent the restaurant after work. “Noticing the two men, Purinton commented to a regular sitting at the bar, ‘Did you see the terrorists on the patio?'” according to the statement. How did the shooting happen? On the evening of Feb. 22, 2017, Purinton was sitting by himself on the front patio of Austin’s Bar & Grill. Kuchibhotla and Madasani were also sitting nearby. He then approached to two men, demanding to know their immigration statuses. “Out of the blue comes this weird-looking gentleman, I say weird-looking because he had anger on his face,” Madasani, 32, later told The New York Times. “I did not hear what he was saying instantly, but I saw the look on Srinivas’s face change drastically. I looked at Adam and he walked towards me, he came to me and said, ‘Are you here legally?’” According to DOJ, Purinton poked Kuchibhotla in the chest, calling him a “terrorist” and other racist epithets. Witnesses at one point heard Purinton shout: “Get out of my country!” Ian Grillot, 24, and another bar patron interceded and escorted Purinton out of the bar. “Everybody kept coming up to us saying ‘This is not what we represent, you guys belong here.'” “Everybody kept coming up to us saying ‘This is not what we represent, you guys belong here,’” Madasani recounted for the Times, saying that other patrons assured them that he and his friend were welcomed at the bar. Purinton, however, drove home to retrieve a semi-automatic pistol. He changed into a different shirt and wore a blue and white scarf, all in an effort to “disguise his identity,” the DOJ said. About 30 minutes later, he returned and shot eight rounds at Kuchibhotla and Madasani on the patio. Four of the bullets struck Kuchibhotla, who later died from his injuries. Madasani was shot once, but survived. As Purinton fled the scene, Grillot tried to catch him. Purinton shot Grillot, who also survived the attack. After the shooting, Purinton “stated over the phone to a friend, and later in person to a bartender, that he had just killed some Iranians,” the DOJ said. The fallout The attack raised concerns about anti-immigrant sentiment in the U.S. and even caught the attention of Indian officials. They and local media wondered if America was a safe place for Indians. Sunayana Dumala, Kuchibhotla’s widow, addressed this in court today via a statement that was read by a prosecutor. Dumala wrote that it was “extremely painful” to face the gunman. She did address Purinton directly in the statement: “If you could have kept your anger inside and spoke to my husband softly, Srinu would have been more than happy to share his background and help you understand that not every brown skinned person is suspicious or evil, but kind, smart and contributing to America,” she wrote. “Instead you chose to rage and bully in anger and when you were stopped, you decided to take their lives,” she added. None of the victims were present for the sentencing, The Kansas City Star reported. In a video produced by the Star after Purinton’s sentencing in May, Dumala said the “murder of my husband will not bring back Srinu to me, but it will send out a very strong message that hate is never acceptable.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions also called the hate crime “detestable” in today’s statement. “While we cannot undo the irreparable harm that this defendant has done, some measure of justice for the victims’ families has been achieved. Such hateful crimes will remain a priority for the Department of Justice,” he said.

On Monday afternoon, four people, including gunman Juan Lopez, died after he opened fire in Chicago’s Mercy Hospital, police said. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie T. Johnson confirmed that 32-year-old Lopez shot and killed his ex-fiancé who worked at the hospital, another hospital employee and a police officer who attempted to apprehend him. Lopez apparently had a history of making threats and pulling out his gun. According to the Chicago Tribune, in 2013 Lopez had threatened to shoot up the Chicago Fire Academy and was fired for “improper conduct toward women.” The Chicago Fire Academy’s department Spokesman Larry Langford told the Tribune he could not confirm if the threats were made towards women. “He was accused of aggressive and improper conduct toward females at the academy,” Langford told the Tribune. “He was disciplined and terminated.” The Sun Times reported that Lopez was married in 2008, and in 2014 his wife filed a petition for an order of protection against him. The petition alleged that Lopez slept with a pistol under his pillow, and that he left the gun out where their small child could reach it, the Sun Times said. In the petition Lopez’s wife also claimed that he had pulled his gun on multiple people including a neighbor and a realtor after forgetting about a scheduled apartment appraisal. His wife also claimed that once she began separation proceedings, Lopez sent her a text on Dec. 1, 2014, threatening “to come to my job and cause a scene.” the Sun Times reported. Police confirmed Lopez had a concealed carry permit and had legally purchased four weapons within the past five years. According to the Tribune, Lopez worked for the Chicago Housing Authority since February 2018 as an associate program specialist. The Chicago Housing Authority issued a statement and said he was hired after undergoing a background check. Story continues “There is no history of complaints about him during the course of his employment at CHA.” they told the Tribune. Mercy Hospital identified the victims as Dr. Tamera O’Neal, Officer Samuel Jimenez and Dayna Less. According to the Chicago Sun Times, 38-year-old O’Neal, an emergency room physician, had broken off her engagement with Lopez months ago. “Family had talked to her and basically said, ‘Cut your ties because you just can’t be friends with someone in situations like that,’” O’Neal’s father told the paper. “He couldn’t let go and he took her away from us.” O’Neal was shot repeatedly in the hospital parking lot after an argument with Lopez, police said.

132,132,90054,https://www.yahoo.com/news/created-3d-printed-guns-funded-192101068.html,He Created 3D-Printed Guns And Funded Neo-Nazis. Now He's An International Fugitive.,"There’s an international manhunt underway for Cody Wilson, the guy credited with creating the blueprints for what was possibly the first fully 3D-printed gun. Wilson, 30, of Austin, Texas, made “suspicious” travel plans for Taiwan shortly after a friend of the victim told him that law enforcement was preparing to arrest him, according to Austin police. He’s accused of paying $500 to a 16-year-old girl he met on a site called SugarDaddyMeet to have sex with him. For now, he’s gone. But his business remains. Wilson may be known for his yearslong battle with the federal government over his plastic gun blueprints, but he’s also had his hands in moneymaking for neo-Nazis, crypto-anarchism (as he puts it) and, allegedly, child sex trafficking. Here’s everything you need to know about Cody Wilson: He’s essentially cornered the market on 3D-printed guns. Cody Wilson shows off his first 3D-printed handgun, The Liberator, at his home in Austin, Texas, on May 10, 2013. (Photo: SIPA USA/PA Images) In 2013, Wilson created what is believed to be the first completely 3D-printed gun, Wired reports. You might think the creator of an entirely new product ― a cheap working gun in America, no less ― would immediately file a patent and try to make some money. But Wilson was a “crypto-anarchist,” in his own words, and he wanted to drop the blueprint for his .380-caliber pistol in the public domain, thumbing his nose at the federal government and Big Gun simultaneously. He uploaded the plans to his website, Defcad.com, along with an anarchist manifesto video, and put in motion what would become the most hotly debated issue in 3D printing: What happens when those printers get cheaper and the average person has access to untraceable cheap plastic guns? The government got involved. President Barack Obama’s State Department ordered Wilson to take down the schematics, while they investigated his action as a possible violation of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which govern access to and release of weaponry. But where Obama took aim at Wilson and Defcad, President Donald Trump has chosen to look the other way. Vox has a great explainer on the recent legal battle, but it essentially goes like this: Wilson sued, claiming that his gun data are speech protected under the First Amendment. Trump’s Justice Department abruptly agreed to a settlement in July that paid Wilson’s legal fees and allowed him to publish his blueprints. Story continues In August, just before Wilson was set to go live with his and other people’s gun blueprints (a business he described as the “Napster” of firearms), a federal court barred him from doing so on public safety grounds. But the court order merely stopped him from posting the blueprints online for anybody to read; it didn’t bar him from selling the plans online and then digitally transmitting them to the buyer. So Wilson started hawking them for any price anybody wanted to pay. “I’m happy to become the iTunes of downloadable guns, if I can’t be the Napster,” he told The New York Times in August. Trump, meanwhile, has gone back and forth on the issue. He tweeted on July 31 that he’s “looking into 3D Plastic Guns being sold to the public” and “Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!” But the battle in court rages on. Wilson isn’t the only one with blueprints for guns nor could he stop their dissemination at this point, even if he wanted to. There are already sites dedicated to hosting his and others’ blueprints. The deed is effectively done, and officials are now looking at the possibility of regulation that would make it harder for the average citizen to print guns. He launched a crowdfunding site for neo-Nazis. Wilson’s other big entrepreneurial effort made thousands of dollars for prominent white supremacists, neo-Nazis and trolls. He founded the site Hatreon, which he called the “#1 funding platform for the Alt Right,” in 2017. The name is a play on the site Patreon, which serves as a crowdfunding resource for artists and other creators. In reality, Hatreon was a safe space for the internet’s worst people to gather and distribute cash to one another. The rest of the crowdfunding internet, including sites like Patreon, GoFundMe and even PayPal, was cracking down on hateful members, and that’s where Hatreon found an audience. ThinkProgress reports that Andrew Anglin, the neo-Nazi founder of the Daily Stormer, was making $8,000 per month on Hatreon, while lesser white supremacist Richard Spencer was pulling in $1,000 per month. By November of last year, a major credit card company had already booted Hatreon off its network, Wilson told The New York Times, and Hatreon.net was shut down. The site reportedly came and went again earlier this year, but hasn’t made any headway since. In January, Wilson tweeted that “there’s a difference between being down and being out of business.” He allegedly sexually abused a teen girl and then took off for Taiwan. On Wednesday, Wilson was charged with sexually assaulting a minor, according to Vice News. But before they had a warrant for his arrest ready, Austin police said Wilson departed for Taiwan, where he’s believed to be staying right now. Police said he learned of his pending arrest, promptly left the country and later missed his flight back to the United States. He was last seen in Taipei. “We know that Mr. Wilson frequently travels for business,” Trey Officer of the Austin Police Department’s organized crime division told reporters on Wednesday. “We don’t know why he went to Taiwan, but we do know that before he left, he was informed by a friend of the victim that she had spoken to the police and they were investigating him for sex with a minor.” Related Coverage 3D-Printed Gun Advocate Cody Wilson Charged With Child Sexual Assault It’s unclear how the U.S. government could get him back, as there’s no extradition treaty between Taiwan and the U.S. It’s also unclear what Wilson’s departure means for his gun business and his ongoing court battles. He was scheduled to appear at a gun conference in Chicago this weekend, according to Vice News, but the appearance has been canceled.

How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Cody Wilson fired the shot heard around the internet in 2013 with what is widely believed to be the first 3D-printed gun. Now the self-described ""crypto-anarchist"" is at the center of a fierce legal battle over whether Americans should be able to print guns that would be unregulated and untraceable. After Wilson in 2013 successfully fired a bullet from the world’s first 3D-printed handgun and posted its design online, the video got nearly half a million views, and the design was downloaded nearly 100,000 times. After a few days, the link was terminated by law enforcement officials. Years of litigation followed, leading to a settlement a week ago allowing Wilson to re-release the gun’s downloadable blueprints, giving anyone with access to a 3D printer the ability to create their own so-called “ghost guns” – unregulated unregistered and untraceable firearms. Eight states and the District of Columbia sued Monday to block release of the blueprints, and a federal judge in Seattle on Wednesday issued a temporary restraining order against Wilson and his nonprofit firm, Defense Distributed.

Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images But download counters on Wilson’s website suggest the blueprints were already downloaded over 20,000 times after Friday’s ruling. “The apocalypse has happened,” Wilson told ABC News on Tuesday. “You just missed it.” Opponents of his effort stressed the dangers. Guns from 3D printers would be “available to any felon, domestic abuser or terrorist,"" said Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a leader of the joint lawsuit by states against Wilson. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., also emphasized the risks from easily available, homemade guns and said Congress should act. “No background check, no training, and they don’t even need to leave the house to make hundreds of guns,” Schumer said Monday, prior to the temporary restraining order on Wilson's company. “If the administration won’t act, Congress must do everything in its power to stop these websites before the damage by a mass shooter or a terrorist occurs.” A 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" is seen in a factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Wilson began experimenting with 3D-printed guns while he was at University of Texas law school, after graduating in 2010 from University of Central Arkansas with a degree in English. He printed his first gun during exam week of his second year of law school, then dropped out to further pursue the project. Wired named Wilson one of that ""15 most dangerous people in the world” in 2012 and one of that ""15 most dangerous people on the internet” in 2015. “The possibilities being introduced are huge,” Wired wrote in 2012. In 2012, when Wilson was just 24, he created Defense Distributed, a nonprofit defense technologies organization, and introduced his initiative to design and release files for 3D-printable guns. Wilson’s ambitions are about more than building guns. “Defense Distributed’s goal isn’t really personal armament,” Wilson explained in the 2013 video. “It’s more the liberation of information, It’s about living in the world where you can just download the file for the thing you want to make in this life.” Wilson said in a 2015 interview with an online radio broadcast that his idea for the project came from WikiLeaks. He was impressed by Julian Assange's controversial practice of publishing classified information and asked himself: “What is the WikiLeaks for guns?” ""What I recognized in Assange at the time was what’s called crypto-anarchy now and what the 'cypherpunks' developed,” Wilson told ABC News. “With these internet channels and cryptologic functions, we could end up creating secure channels, secret information, and provide worldwide distribution.” The plan was immediately controversial. Crowdfunding site Indiegogo kicked him off its platform. Statasys Inc. revoked his lease for one of their 3D-printing machines. Days after Wilson first posted the 3D-printed gun blueprints online, the State Department demanded Wilson remove them. Wilson filed suit, claiming a violation of his freedom of speech. He has said that opposition to his 3D guns shows shows how the government excessively exerts its power, limiting societal change and technological development. “It is obvious that the American techno-state has after religion become more fundamentalist and has after generations of global decolonization become more imperial,” Wilson wrote in the online publication Jacobite. “After the Cold War, it is far more aggressive in its global technical control and surveillance.” While his 3D-printed guns project was stalled in courts, he turned to other areas of interest. Wilson co-founded Dark Wallet, a “bitcoin wallet designed to make bitcoin use completely private,” allowing for increased confidentiality in financial transactions. Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed company, holds a 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" in his factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images “Bitcoin is a serious challenge to the sovereignty of the state and the state’s money power at a certain point,” Wilson said. That same year, Defense Distributed announced the Ghost Gunner, a milling machine that allows anyone to construct AR-15 and AR-308 metal guns. With accumulating legal fees, Wilson remains focused on the Ghost Gunner manufacturing company, now a lucrative business with 18 employees. In 2017, Wilson created Hatreon, an online crowdfunding site supporting popular alt-right voices – including white supremacists Richard Spencer and Andrew Anglin -- who had been banned from the popular crowdfunding platform Patreon. Some of the money that helped fund the violent Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville was raised through Hatreon. “I felt no shame at all in helping Anglin and Spencer and these total villains,” Wilson said. “There’s just this intentional mainstream effort to gate-keep what are the boards of realistic debate, and of course that’s just not how [politics] functions.” The temporary restraining order slapped down this week will remain in effect at least until a hearing is held on Aug. 10, but in some ways, Wilson said, he has already accomplished what he set out to do. “I’ve demonstrated -- and Assange has and the bitcoin people have -- that crypto-anarchy is really what’s winning right now,” Wilson said. “The classical ideas of, control, confinement, surveillance—they don’t really apply to persistent, live networking.” Wilson’s endeavors have landed him on the radar of several gun reform organizations. “We have been following his activities for several years,” said J. Adam Skaggs, chief counsel to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Giffords Center is part of a coalition that fought unsuccessfully to prevent the court settlement on July 27. Giffords has identified other ghost gun sellers it’s concerned about, according to Skaggs. But he said Wilson stands out from the rest. Wilson said he won’t be censored and he’ll continue to engage with people whom some might consider extreme. “You’ll find good ideas in with the crazy people,” Wilson said.",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the self-described “Warreno-anarchist” who wants to release a gun from 3D-print guns online.","Meet Cody Wilson, the 'crypto-anarchist' who wants you to be able to 3D-print unregulated guns The debate over 3D-printed guns has been a legal one for years.

The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, occurred after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun ownership laws. At the same time, gun control activists are stepping up pressure on Amazon.com Inc and other online streaming platforms to drop the online video channel NRATV, featuring gun-friendly programming produced by the NRA. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, founded after 20 first-graders were shot and killed at a Connecticut school in 2012, sent letters to Apple Inc, AT&T Inc, Amazon, Alphabet Inc's Google and Roku Inc on Friday, asking them to drop NRATV from their platforms. ""We have been just disgusted by NRATV since its beginning,"" Shannon Watts, founder of the Moms Demand Action group, told Reuters. ""It tries to pit Americans against one another, all in an attempt to further their agenda of selling guns."" AT&T said it does not carry NRATV. None of the other companies immediately responded to requests for comment. The issue of gun control, and the NRA's role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate on Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights. The group has not commented on companies cutting ties. Angry student survivors of the shooting have confronted politicians from state lawmakers to U.S. President Donald Trump himself, demanding stricter gun control laws. In response, the NRA and Trump have suggested arming teachers who have received training to deter attackers, a proposal that has been met with skepticism by teachers unions and gun violence experts. TRENDING ON TWITTER Before the corporate defections, nearly two dozen companies nationwide had offered incentives to NRA members, according to ThinkProgress.com, a news site owned by the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The attrition started late Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA's contract to issue a co-branded Visa card. By Friday, the list of defectors expanded to include Symantec Corp, which ended an discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs. Chubb Ltd said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc, also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA. David Hogg, one of the student survivors of last week's attack who launched the #NeverAgain anti-gun violence movement, said the students would target any company with ties to the NRA, in addition to lawmakers who accept donations. About a dozen other companies with marketing ties to the NRA, including FedEx Corp and Hertz, which offer discount programs, did not respond to requests for comment. SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS Activists have also called on public pension funds to divest from gun maker stocks, which were broadly lower on Friday. Meanwhile, an online campaign using the Twitter hashtag #StopNRAmazon picked up steam, putting pressure on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to drop the channel. Many of those tweeting are in the entertainment industry. ""Ironic how the @NRA likes to point a finger at what kids watch on TV ... while they spew vile rhetoric on NRAtv, streamed on @Amazon and aimed solely at boosting gun sales,"" wrote screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer.

I mean that doesn't make sense, and, frankly, I explained that to the NRA.” At Monday's news briefing, CBS's Margaret Brennan noted that Trump had not said anything similar to the governors earlier in the day and asked White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders whether the president still wants to raise the age limit. AD AD “Something's still being discussed, but a final determination and legislative piece has not been determined on that front yet,” Sanders replied. That's not a strong yes. “Is he reconsidering how that should be implemented?” Brennan followed up. “In terms of the concept, there's still support for that,” Sanders answered. “But how it would be implemented and what that might look like is still very much part of the discussion.” Fox Business's Blake Burman said the president's position, as stated by Sanders, “feels like a little bit of a downgrade.” Burman pointed out that Trump ate lunch with National Rifle Association officials on Sunday, and he asked whether the NRA had influenced the president. AD “I don't think it's at all a downgrade,” Sanders said. “I think we're talking specifically about implementation and what this process would look like, what specific pieces of legislation might look like. And we haven't seen those yet, so it would be premature for us to weigh in. But, as I said, the president is still supportive of the concept. AD “To try to pretend like he's being influenced by any one group would be ridiculous,” she added, “considering the number of individuals he's met with that come from both the far left to the far right and a lot of those in between.” The Daily Mail's Francesca Chambers remarked that “it does sound like there's a softening of the stance from the president between what we heard last week and what we're hearing now today. Is the president firmly committed to [raising the age limit], if he can see it in a legislative form?” AD “Again, we haven't seen the legislation in form yet,” Sanders said, “and so we're not going to speak to potential legislation that doesn't exist that may have a lot of different, nuanced language. In concept, the president still supports it, but in terms of legislation, we'd need to see what that looks like before we'd weigh in further.” AD Sanders's claim that the White House needs to see a bill before weighing in might make sense if it were not inconsistent with something she said earlier in the briefing. “On bump stocks,” she said, “the president did sign an executive memo directing the ATF and Department of Justice to work on outlawing bump stocks, so we don't have to wait for a legislative fix. However, if we cannot find an administrative fix, we would support a legislative solution to complete that.” AD So, Trump is in favor of legislation to ban bump stocks, even though he has not seen such a bill, yet he is “not going to speak to potential legislation that doesn't exist” when it comes to raising the purchasing age to 21.",Donald Trump Donald Trump 2017 presidential inauguration Official    Communication The Washington Post Inauguration Business,President Trump on Monday at the White House.,"The president last week endorsed a higher age requirement as part of a trio of gun-control measures and said Saturday night on Fox News that “it doesn't seem to make sense that you have to wait until you're 21 years old to get a pistol, but to get a gun like this maniac used in the school [in Parkland, Fla.], you get that at 18.

A Florida House committee brought that bill one step closer to becoming law Tuesday, nearly two weeks after a mass shooting a Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that killed 17 students and faculty members, in vote that came out 23-6. The committee’s approval followed after more than four hours of emotional discussion between representatives in the Florida House and some of the parents who lost children on Valentines Day. “It doesn’t go far enough, and now it goes too far in other areas,” Democratic Rep Jared Moskowitz, a former Parkland vice mayor, said of the bill he ultimately voted for. “But the NRA opposes it, and I will not vote with the NRA.” One of the parents in attendance, Max Schachter, whose 14-year-old son Alex was a victim of the massacre, echoed the sentiment but said he thinks it could have saved his son. “While the proposed bill does not meet all of my goals, the components of the bill would have saved my little boy Alex,” he said. “And if we would have had these measures in place, I would not have had to bury my son next to his mother a week and a half ago.” The discussions in Tallahassee Tuesday contrasted sharply with protests that had taken place just a day earlier in the state’s capital. The discussions were more orderly, according to the Associated Press, compared to the sometimes rowdy protesters the day before. The bill, in addition to allowing teachers to use their concealed weapons permits at school, would also raise the age restriction for buying a rifle form 18 to 21, and would keep guns out of people’s hands for three days.

The Run The Jewels MC is known for his strong political stances on racism, mass incarceration, and other issues, and while this interview might have caught some by surprise, he's been an outspoken NRA supporter (and member) for quite some time. In Mike's view, the important discussions about gun control should include voices from both sides. He also said that gun owners want violence against children to end, though they disagree on how to achieve that. ""I have worked as a tireless advocate of children and disenfranchised women in my community. And I have also worked with gun groups like Georgians Against Gun Violence [...] If there's a table to be sat at, the gun owner needs to be there, so I try to see the problem from the whole perspective,"" he said in the clip. Mike and the host echoed similar ideas and claimed that though they may be viewed as ""lackeys"" for the NRA, the onus of that title is actually on everyone else. “You’re a lackey of the progressive movement because you’ve never disagreed with the people who tell you what to do,” the rapper explained. The conversation shifted slightly to focus on the March for Our Lives protests, namely regarding the financial support it has received thus far. “Our biggest celebrities are donating millions to a march while our inner-city schools are in deplorable conditions,” said Noir, to which Mike agreed and added, ""Celebrities are told what to do."" He went on to take down not only anti-gun campaigns but shared that he declined to do an anti-bullying drop for an unnamed radio station. ""Your child needs to get punched in the face so he can learn to punch someone back,"" he said. ""You have to develop the aptitude to fight back. We are raising a generation of kids where everyone gets a trophy. But in real life, everyone don’t get a trophy. In real life, the cops don’t come on time."" Watch the full interview above.

485,485,100293,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/10/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-kellyanne-conway.html,Pittsburgh synagogue shooting: Kellyanne Conway blames “anti-religiosity.”,"In an appearance on Fox & Friends on Monday, Kellyanne Conway defended the president’s response to the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 dead allegedly at the hands of a violently anti-Semitic man. Conway’s unwavering praise for the president and criticism of the media are no longer surprising, but she did manage to shock some viewers with her analysis of one of the causes of the slaughter: The anti-religiosity in this country that is somehow in vogue and funny to make fun of anybody of faith, to constantly be making fun of people who express religion, the late-night comedians, the unfunny people on TV shows—it’s always anti-religious. And remember, these people were gunned down in their place of worship. As were the people in South Carolina several years ago. They were there because they’re people of faith. And it’s that faith that needs to bring us together. This is no time to be driving God out of the public square. One of the many problems with Conway’s comparison of a violent attack on the Jewish synagogue to verbal attacks on religion in general is that doing so erases the specific anti-Semitic motivation of Saturday’s rampage. Jews reacting to the attack have pointed to both the long history of Jewish persecution and the specific and significant uptick of hate crimes against Jews and other anti-Semitic harassment since the 2016 election. Conway is not wrong to reference the 2015 mass shooting at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in connection with this synagogue shooting. But the Charleston shooter was motivated not by anti-religious fervor but by racial hatred rooted in white-supremacist ideology. What the two massacres have in common are far-right radicalization in online communities and hate taken to its extreme. To categorize them under general anti-religious bias serves only to bolster a conservative argument that there is a war on Christianity, to obscure the bitter reality of America’s bigotry by claiming that the most powerful group in the U.S. is itself being victimized, and to stir xenophobic fears among the white conservative base of losing cultural dominance. In other ways, Conway tried to simultaneously condemn anti-Semitism and erase this very specific form of hatred from the crime. At one point in her appearance, she condemned “media making it about themselves” before mentioning, without any clear connection, the 2017 shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, that left several Republicans injured. A year and a half earlier, Steve Scalise almost lost his life crawling across the outfield in his own blood because that person was coming there to “hunt Republicans.” You’ve gotta call it what it is. The president’s asking us to rise above it and asking us to come together to unify as a nation. And anybody who’s saying he isn’t isn’t listening. She repeated that the media’s focus should be on the “evil in the world.” Then she again chastised the press for covering the criticisms of the president’s inflammatory rhetoric and his abdication of the role of consoler in chief as well as the idea that Trump’s tolerance of anti-Semitism among some of his most rabid supporters has empowered the most hateful and violent elements of the right. These arguments, Conway asserted, showed the Trump White House to be a victim of the events: The chyrons, the comments. I won’t even repeat the insults because it gives them oxygen. It gives them much higher ratings than they would otherwise get in their own shows. But the rhetoric that is said day in and day out about this White House, the people who work here, the president, the vice president, their families—it’s got to stop. You’ve got people constantly making comments about Nazism, Nazi Germany. “This president is turning us into”—somebody from CNN tweeted out a picture of concentration camps when the migrants were trying to come over the border earlier this year. That’s got to stop. Conway’s defense ignores instances in which Trump has tolerated or even seemed to tacitly endorse anti-Semitic elements of his base. He has retweeted notoriously anti-Semitic figures and groups; famously blamed both sides in the Charlottesville clash between protesters and white supremacists and neo-Nazis; signed onto conspiracy theories featuring George Soros, one of the most common figures at the center of conspiracy theories positioning cosmopolitan Jews as the shadowy figures controlling government and media (and a focus of the killer’s hatred); and proudly claimed himself to be a “nationalist” while seeming to acknowledge the “white nationalist” connotation of that word. (Trump defenders have pointed out that the suspect in the synagogue shooting apparently hated Trump, believing him to have been controlled by Jews, and that Trump has Jews in his own family.) We also know the gunman was angered by the synagogue’s support for refugees, and there’s no denying Trump stoked anti-immigrant sentiments as a central element of his campaign and presidency. Instead, Conway argued that the president had done a praiseworthy job in responding to the shooting. It’s true that Trump forcefully denounced anti-Semitism and hate at a campaign rally that day, but he followed up his remarks with jokes and attacks on Democrats. He also argued that the synagogue should have had armed guards. In defending his decision to even hold that rally just hours after the shooting, Trump falsely claimed that the New York Stock Exchange reopened the day after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Conway, though, seemed to think any critiques related to these decisions were absurd: In this case, the president is leading the country to heal. And he said it many times during that speech. They complain. They don’t like the way he pronounced the word. They don’t like how he said it. It was five minutes too late. He should have said it on Twitter first. It was 18 seconds too early than what they expected. Cut it out, and listen carefully, because everybody else is listening. More than 16,000 people have signed a letter to the president written by the leaders of a Pittsburgh-based Jewish group saying that Trump would not be welcome in the city unless he forcefully denounces white nationalism. The synagogue attack followed a week in which a white man killed two black people in a Kentucky grocery store in what appeared to be a racially motivated attack and in which a Trump acolyte mailed more than a dozen pipe bombs to prominent Democrats and to CNN.",Kellyanne Conway The White House Counselor to the President of the United States Republican Party CNN Fox News  Democratic Party President of the United States News,Kellyanne Conway on Fox’s “Fox & Friends” on Monday.,"In an appearance on Fox & Friends on Monday, Kellyanne Conway defended the president’s response to the mass shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh that left 11 dead allegedly at the hands of a violently anti-Semitic man.

Gary Jackson never stood a chance. Gary was 28 and working as a security guard at a taco truck in Oakland, Calif., in 2009 when he saw Dreshawn Lee carrying a sawed-off shotgun and reported it to police. Three months later, Lee took his revenge by shooting and killing Jackson with an AK-47-style semiautomatic assault rifle. I was the prosecutor who persuaded a jury to convict Lee and persuaded a judge to put him away for 65 years to life. But Gary’s autopsy report still haunts me. Trauma surgeons and coroners will tell you the high-velocity bullet fired from a military-style, semiautomatic assault weapon moves almost three times as fast as a 9mm handgun bullet, delivering far more energy. The bullets create cavities through the victim, wrecking a wider swath of tissue, organs and blood vessels. And a low-recoil weapon with a higher-capacity magazine means more of these deadlier bullets can be fired accurately and quickly without reloading. An assault weapon, then, is a hand-held weapon of war, capable of spraying a crowd with more lethal fire in seconds. More:Parkland survivor: Here's what it was like to watch my friends die in Room 1216 More:Imagine if London terrorists had guns and Orlando shooter had only knives So Gary didn’t stand much chance. First-graders and teachers in Newtown, Conn., didn’t either. Nor did dancers at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, nor concert-goers in Las Vegas, nor teenagers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High in Parkland, Fla., nor the people at the Waffle House outside Nashville. Like so many American mass-shooting victims in recent decades, their doom was all but assured by the murderer’s tool. Nonetheless, we can give ourselves and our children the chance these victims never had. We can finally act to remove weapons designed for war from our streets, once and for all. Reinstating the federal assault weapons ban that was in effect from 1994 to 2004 would prohibit manufacture and sales, but it would not affect weapons already possessed. This would leave millions of assault weapons in our communities for decades to come. Instead, we should ban possession of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons, we should buy back such weapons from all who choose to abide by the law, and we should criminally prosecute any who choose to defy it by keeping their weapons. The ban would not apply to law enforcement agencies or shooting clubs. There's something new and different about the surviving Parkland high schoolers’ demands. They dismiss the moral equivalence we’ve made for far too long regarding the Second Amendment. I've been guilty of it myself, telling constituents and reporters that “we can protect the Second Amendment and protect lives.” The Parkland teens have taught us there is no right more important than every student’s right to come home after class. The right to live is supreme over any other. Our courts haven’t found a constitutional right to have assault weapons, anyway. When the Supreme Court held in 2008 that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that this right “is not unlimited” and is “not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” More:Navy vet on Vegas: We need gun laws that make us as safe as our military POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media Since that District of Columbia v. Heller decision, four federal appeals courts have upheld assault weapons bans. Many other firearms are available for self-protection, they found, and the danger that assault weapons pose to society is a legitimate reason for states and localities to ban them. Australia got it right. After a man used military-style weapons to kill 35 people in April 1996, that nation adopted strict new measures and bought back 643,726 newly illegal rifles and shotguns at market value. The cost — an estimated $230 million in U.S. dollars at the time — was funded by a temporary 0.2% tax levy on national health insurance. America won’t get off that cheaply. Gun ownership runs so deep that we don’t even know how many military-style semiautomatic rifles are in U.S. civilian hands. Based on manufacturing figures and other indirect data, there could be 15 million assault weapons out there. If we offer $200 to buy back each weapon — as many local governments have — then it would cost about $3 billion; at $1,000 each, the cost would be about $15 billion. It’s no small sum. But let’s put it in context. The federal government is spending an estimated $4 trillion this year; $15 billion would be 0.375% of that, not that we must spend it all in one year. Meanwhile, the GOP’s tax “reform” — a giveaway to corporations and the rich that threw comparatively meager scraps to working families — is projected to increase the national debt by $1.9 trillion over the next decade. What is it worth to American taxpayers to not see our families, friends and neighbors cut down in a hail of gunfire? Consider this an investment in averting carnage and heartache and loss. When I think of Jackson, I think of all the others who died with wounds like his. I think about my dad and two brothers who put their lives on the line as law enforcement officers. I think about my 11-month-old son, Nelson, and the safe classrooms I want him to learn in. America has a deadly problem, a problem other developed nations have avoided or addressed. Some say we’re already too far gone to take corrective action, but we cannot have a defeatist attitude about this. Fixing our problem requires boldness and will be costly, but the cost of letting it fester will be far higher — for our wallets, and for our souls. Rep.

It wasn’t anything fancy; a few guys and gals hooted and hollered over beers in the corner of the bar, duking it out in pairs of two, either in front of a tiny TV or a projector screen. Some were regulars, who’d been schlepping their controllers and consoles to this King Street venue since it was a laundromat and bar, well before last year, when it became a dedicated barcade called Keg & Coin. Others were just curious and asked to hop in for a quick round of Smash. It was like a lot of other Jacksonville gaming events: smaller affairs that happen almost nightly and usually take place at one of three mainstay arcades in town, or at a less formal locale like someone’s apartment, where this competitive gaming community got its roots. But of course, this night was different. Some of the folks watching the tournament wore shirts or pins bearing the name GLHF ― the arcade just over two miles away at Jacksonville Landing where, less than 24 hours prior, a mass shooting at a Madden tournament left three dead and another 11 wounded. Keg & Coin, then, was the obvious setting for them to gather and mourn together; to revel; to plot their next steps; to just get their mind off things. “We needed somewhere to get together and hang out ― now this is one of the only places to do that,” said Joshua “Tyger” Campbell, 35, who’s been hosting competitions in town for nearly two decades. “In Jacksonville, this scene used to be so underground. But in the past three to five years we’ve had so much community organizing and so many events that we’re stronger. We have so many places now where gamers feel safe to congregate.” They also wanted to point out the strength of this community. Campbell said he was excited that a national gaming tournament was being held at one of his local haunts. It signaled that the community he’d helped to start, with small Dance Dance Revolution tournaments held back in 2003, was thriving. Story continues But then came the shooting, one that would undoubtedly change the message about his community. This was, after all, a shooting at a video game tournament, and gaming has been a punching bag and a boogeyman for politicians since shooting at Columbine. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has continued that storied tradition, vowing earlier this year to look into the connection between video games and mass shootings. Surely, this real-world, violent event would breed more mischaracterizations about video game culture. “It’s just heartbreaking,” said Mark Ronan, 22, who organizes gaming events across the city. “GLHF is here so we can have a place to hold awesome events like the Madden tournament. One of Jacksonville’s opportunities to shine in the esports world was soiled, and made headlines for all the wrong reasons.” The people HuffPost spoke to Monday ― gaming advocates and activists, family and friends of those victims still hospitalized ― wanted to paint a different picture of local gaming. They’ve spent years fostering a culture of charity, entertainment and competition that extends well beyond the shooting at Jacksonville Landing. ’This Is His Dream’ Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo poses with Florida Gov. Rick Scott from his hospital bed in Jacksonville. (Photo: Courtesy of Sujeil Lopez) At the University of Florida Health medical center, Sujeil Lopez told reporters that she used to get upset when her son, 26-year-old Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo, played video games for a dozen hours a day or more where he grew up in New York City. “I used to get mad,” she said. “My husband used to say, ‘He could be outside doing a lot worse, leave him alone!’ I used to be so furious. But he went to high school, went to college, and he’s a good man.” Anselimo now makes a living playing NBA 2K competitively and boasts a sponsorship from the Milwaukee Bucks. Lopez created a Twitter account just to follow and support his career. She’s fully on board. “This is his dream ― his life,” Lopez said, a life that was put on hold when her son was shot three times on Sunday, once in the chest, once in the hip and again in his right hand. Lopez spoke to reporters as he went through surgery on that hand, a procedure which would decide whether he could continue his career. “As a mother you want your child to be brave,” she said. “If he can’t play and he can’t work, his life would be changed forever. ... But look forward to seeing him again. This is not the last you’ll see of oLARRY, I promise you that!” In the same hospital where Lopez spoke, another group of friends and family was waiting on Chris “Dubby” McFarland to recover. The world-renowned Madden player was grazed in the head by a bullet on Sunday. His friend, John Washington, said outside the ER that McFarland’s gaming community, and sense of safety, had been “invaded.” “He’s very emotional, his whole family is emotional. He’s a soldier, but now it’s like, where in America can you go and feel safe anymore?” Washington said. “The gamers really appreciated this event coming to town. This was just so catastrophic for all of them and the Jacksonville community as a whole.” McFarland, he said, was expected to be released from the hospital sometime this week. But his side career in gaming may be put on hold. ‘Gaming’s Not Going Anywhere’ From left to right: Kyle Schmisek, Joshua Campbell and Mark Ronan, at Keg & Coin in Jacksonville. (Photo: Andy Campbell/HuffPost) There’s rehabilitation to be done, but luckily for the gamers in town, there’s already a network in place to do that. Before the shooting, they had Games Art And Music, a gaming culture company that melds local entertainment with events; the Jacksonville chapter of Extra Life, which raises money for local pediatric programs through gaming events; and locals like Campbell and Ronan, who are already preparing to host charity events for their people. “A lot of people have questions about how they can help, or how we can increase safety at our events ... it encourages me,” Ronan said. “We have to bring everyone back together to show that something like this isn’t going to stop us from having a good time and doing what we love.” Kyle Schmisek, 32, who hosts trivia at GLHF, said calls were rolling in from people wanting to donate to the arcade and various victims’ funds. Over the course of 24 hours, he went from a local organizer in gaming to a national one. “It needs to be done so I do it,” he said. “I’ve been sitting around waiting to do something other than just donate, so I’m here to help. But there’s still a lot to be done. We want to help these families, and we’re still working on that.” Schmisek, Campbell and Ronan sat around a table outside Keg & Coin as the Smash Bros. tournament wrapped up, talking shop and devising plans on what to do next. When asked whether the shooting changed anything for them in terms of their involvement in the scene, they each laughed. “This is my livelihood,” Ronan said. “I work at a game shop, I host events, I travel for them. I put a lot of my effort into Smash. I wouldn’t give it up for anything.” Campbell agreed. “Gaming’s not going anywhere for me,” he said. Love HuffPost?

The attorney who represented a woman who was harassed by alleged Maryland newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos from 2009 to 2011 described him as a ""dangerous person."" Nearly seven years ago, Ramos pleaded guilty to a criminal harassment charge, court documents filed in the District Court of Maryland in Anne Arundel County show. Ramos, now 38, had befriended the woman on Facebook in 2009 and used information he gathered from the social media platform to attack her, Brennan McCarthy told ABC News. ""He would tell her to do things like hang herself,"" McCarthy said. ""He wrote a letter to her [employer] stating that they should fire her because she's a 'bipolar drunkard.' He did terrible things to this woman."" On Thursday, Ramos allegedly entered 888 Bestgate Road, the building that houses the newsroom for the Capital Gazette, and opened fire on employees for the local newspaper, killing five people, according to the Anne Arundel Police Department. The 888 Bestgate Road building is seen after police received reports of multiple people being shot at The Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, Md., June 28, 2018. Jose Luis Magana/AP In 2012, Ramos had filed a defamation lawsuit against the Capital Gazette following a story about the harassment case, former editor and publisher Tom Marquardt told ABC News. The article, which was written in 2011, stated that Ramos had reached out to a former high school classmate on Facebook, asking for help because he was having some issues. The woman, who was not named in the story, tried to help and suggested that he seek counseling. ""That sparked months of emails in which Ramos alternately asked for help, called her vulgar names and told her to kill herself,"" the article said. Jarrod Ramos, 38, of Laurel, Maryland, is seen in this undated mug shot. Anne Arundel Police A judge placed Ramos on 18 months of supervised probation and ordered him to continue therapy and refrain from any further contact with the woman or her family, the court documents show. Ramos claimed he was defamed in the lawsuit against the Capital Gazette, which named Marquardt as well as the reporter who wrote it. A few months later, Ramos filed another complaint that added a charge of invasion of privacy. The case was ultimately dismissed. Marquardt had once received a death threat from Ramos and alerted authorities, but there was not enough evidence to file charges against him, he said. McCarthy described Ramos as ""incredibly angry."" ""The malice dripped off this man in court,"" he said. McCarthy was so affected by Ramos that he began to fear for his own life as well. Brennan McCarthy, the attorney who represented a woman who Maryland shooting suspect Jarrod Ramos had stalked from 2009 to 2011, described him to ABC News as a ""dangerous person."" ABC News After McCarthy got a second protective order for his client and agreed to accept all pleadings and correspondence on her behalf, Ramos allegedly began to harass him too. ""He then started stalking me, my Facebook feed, my own personal things,"" he said. ""...I have no doubt that he was on my street, and it was a very scary situation."" Each morning when he wakes up, McCarthy says se looks out the window to make sure Ramos isn't near his home. He still does it to this day, as does the woman he stalked, he said. ""He left that sort of impression on me,"" he said. ""This is a very dangerous person."" Steve Schuh, county executive of Anne Arundel County, holds a copy of The Capital Gazette near the scene of a shooting at the newspaper's office, June 29, 2018, in Annapolis, Md. Patrick Semansky/AP McCarthy also said that Ramos was ""smart enough to walk the edge so that he did not quite violate the law."" ""He would say things, like, for instance, 'Mr. McCarthy, wouldn't it be so sad if you were to be run over today and die bleeding in your own driveway, and if, perhaps, I might have been in the truck?' It's not a direct threat. It's a referential threat.'"" The woman whom Ramos stalked was so frightened by him that when she left the state, she didn't leave a forwarding address, and she alerted the local sheriff's office to Ramos in case he went looking for her, McCarthy said. ""She still has her gun,"" he said. ""...She's still scared."" Police stand watch outside the Robert F.

Eric Swalwell on Friday said the U.S. government would use its nuclear weapons in a hypothetical war against Second Amendment supporters refusing to give up their firearms. The California Democrat, who is openly considering a run for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2020, made the outlandish remark on social media after a gun-rights advocate pointed out that the lawmaker once called for gun owners to surrender their assault weapons. “So basically @RepSwalwell wants a war. Because that's what you would get. You're outta your f------ mind if you think I'll give up my rights and give the [government] all the power,"" Joe Biggs tweeted at Swalwell. This prompted Swalwell to defend himself, saying it would be a “short war” because “the government has nukes,” implying the government would use its nuclear arsenal against its own citizens. The comment drew an immediate backlash, with thousands of people criticizing the lawmaker for the ill-thought-out remark. “Here is an actual member of the U.S. Congress talking about using nuclear weapons against Americans,” David Freddoso wrote. “Personally, I have a bigger problem with an elected official blithely talking about nuking his fellow Americans than my neighbor owning an AR-15,” Cam Edwards tweeted. Swalwell -- a member of both the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee -- tried to defuse the situation, saying the need for a firearm to protect against the government is “ludicrous” and suggested that if an assault weapon ban would happen, people would just follow the law. He later clarified that he was merely being facetious in his suggestion about the use of nuclear weapons. “I sarcastically point[ed] out USA isn't losing to his assault weapon (it's not the 18th Century),” he wrote. Meanwhile, Swalwell appeared Friday on HBO’s ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" show, talking about his potential plan to run for president, saying he’s “considering” it. The lawmaker, who will turn 40 in November 2020, would be the youngest candidate ever elected president.

102,102,212,http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2018/07/31/3-d-printable-guns-donald-trump/870557002/,Courts in three states bar release of 3D-printable gun blueprints,"WASHINGTON – Three courts on Tuesday barred the chief promoter of 3D-printable guns from posting his designs online, just hours before a midnight deadline that would have made such information widely accessible. Courts in New York, New Jersey and Washington State issued rulings barring Cody Wilson and his company, Defense Distribution, from uploading instructions for making 3D-printable guns at midnight Wednesday – as he had planned to do under a settlement reached in June with the Trump administration ""Today Cody Wilson committed to not publish any new printable gun codes nationwide until a court hearing in September,"" New Jersey's attorney general, Gurbir S. Grewal, announced, calling it a ""big victory for public safety and law enforcement safety.” Wilson downplayed the court agreement in an email to USA TODAY. ""We agreed to maintain the status quo, keep up existing files, block (New Jersey) IP addresses, and not post new files. We gave up nothing,"" Wilson said. The legal tussle came after President Donald Trump weighed in on the issue – and less than 24 hours before the technology was poised to become widely available under a settlement his own administration reached this year with Defense Distributed, a Texas-based nonprofit. Trump said in a tweet Tuesday morning that he was ""looking into"" easy access to blueprints for 3D-printable guns, saying the idea ""doesn't seem to make much sense."" Wilson first designed a 3D-printable plastic pistol, called the ""Liberator .380,"" in 2012 and put the plans online. The State Department quickly advised Wilson to remove the information, saying it could be a violation of international export law. Wilson complied but sued the State Department and its chief, John Kerry, who ran the agency in the Obama administration. The State Department has purview over the issue because it's in charge of enforcing the Arms Export Control Act and other arms trafficking regulations. The Arms Export Control Act authorizes the president to control the import and export of defense weapons and defense services and to regulate their import and export. In June, the State Department, now led by Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, settled the case with Wilson. Under that agreement, Defense Distributed would have been able to post downloadable instructions for 3D-printable guns starting Wednesday, making such firearms available to anyone with the right machine and materials. The printers needed to make the guns can cost from $5,000 to $600,000, according to Vice News. Would-be gunmakers also need high-quality plastic. Defense Distributed already sells parts that help users build their own untraceable firearms, known as ""ghost guns"" for their lack of serial numbers. All 3D-printed guns are untraceable, and since you can make them yourself, no background check is required. That prospect has rattled gun control advocates, who fear it could worsen the epidemic of gun violence in the U.S. and make it easier for terrorists to gain access to a raft of deadly firearms. New Jersey, along with seven other states and the District of Columbia, sued the Trump administration Monday seeking to block the 3D-printed weapons from becoming available. Grewal said a New Jersey state court ordered that Wilson and other defendants ""have agreed that they will not upload any additional files” on their websites until a hearing this fall. ""I was proud to stand up to Cody Wilson and Defense Distributed, and to make clear that their plans to share printable gun codes with everyone – including terrorists, criminals, and juveniles – was a threat to all our residents,"" Grewal said. ""Now that Cody Wilson is stepping back from publication, the court is going to hold him to his promise not to post any new files until September."" Pompeo suggested last week that he would review the issue, in response to questions from lawmakers on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But on Tuesday, State Department officials suggested Pompeo was not planning to take further action on the issue. The agency's spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, defended the decision to settle the case, saying that move was based on legal advice from the Justice Department. “The reason that the State Department got involved … is because of our role in controlling foreign access to U.S. defense technology,” she said. “The State Department wants to prevent the wrong people from acquiring weapons overseas.” But, she said, “we were informed that we would have lost this case in court, or would have likely lost this case in court, based on First Amendment grounds … The Department of Justice suggested that the State Department and the U.S. government settle this case, and so that is what was done.” Nauert said the debate has now become about domestic gun control, an issue better suited for Congress and law enforcement officials. “At least since the year 2013 … these computer-assisted design files have been available online,” she added. In his tweet Tuesday morning, Trump said he had talked to the NRA about the issue. Tuesday afternoon, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said the president was ""committed to the safety and security of all Americans and considers this his highest responsibility. In the United States, it is currently illegal to own or make a wholly, plastic gun of any kind – including those made on a 3D printer. The administration supports this nearly two-decade-old law. We will continue to look at all options available to us to do do what is necessary to protect Americans while also supporting the First and Second amendments."" The National Rifle Association dismissed the concerns of gun-control advocates, saying even if the blueprints are available, the plastic guns will still be illegal. “Many anti-gun politicians and members of the media have wrongly claimed that 3-D printing technology will allow for the production and widespread proliferation of undetectable plastic firearms,"" Chris W. Cox, executive director of the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action, said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. ""Regardless of what a person may be able to publish on the Internet, undetectable plastic guns have been illegal for 30 years,"" Cox said, pointing to a 1988 federal law that prohibits the manufacture, import, sale and possession of an undetectable firearm. The Wednesday deadline spurred some talk, but no real action, in Congress. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., tried to move legislation to bar the online publication of blueprints used to make functioning 3D-printed guns. But Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, objected, saying the measure raised First Amendment concerns.

18,18,10693,https://www.yahoo.com/news/wanted-shooting-suspect-forcibly-committed-2016-033336896.html,Some wanted shooting suspect forcibly committed in 2016,"MIAMI (AP) -- Documents show some officials were so concerned about the mental stability of the student accused of last month's Florida high school rampage that they decided he should be forcibly committed. But the recommendation was never acted upon. Cruz is accused of the shooting rampage that killed 14 students and three school employees at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14. In addition, 17 people were wounded. A commitment under the law would have made it more difficult if not impossible for Nikolas Cruz to obtain a gun legally. The documents in the criminal case against Nikolas Cruz, which were obtained by The Associated Press, show school officials and a sheriff's deputy recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation. The documents are part of Cruz's criminal case in the shooting. They also show that he had written the word ""kill"" in a notebook, told a classmate that he wanted to buy a gun and use it, and had cut his arm supposedly in anger because he had broken up with a girlfriend. He also told another student he had drunk gasoline and was throwing up. Calls had even been made to the FBI about the possibility of Cruz using a gun at school. The documents were provided by a psychological assessment service initiated by Cruz's mother called Henderson Behavioral Health. The documents show a high school resource officer who was also a sheriff's deputy and two school counselors recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be committed for mental evaluation under Florida's Baker Act. That law allows for involuntary commitment for mental health examination for at least three days. Such an involuntary commitment would also have been a high obstacle if not a complete barrier to legally obtaining a firearm, such as the AR-15 type rifle used in the Stoneman Douglas massacre on Feb. 14, authorities say. There is no evidence Cruz was ever committed. Coincidentally, the school resource officer who recommended that Cruz be ""Baker Acted"" was Scot Peterson — the same Broward Sheriff's Office deputy who resigned amid accusations he failed to respond to the shooting by staying outside the building where the killings occurred. Story continues David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor, said that an involuntary commitment would have been a huge red flag had Cruz attempted to buy a firearm legally. ""If he had lied, hopefully the verification of the form would have pulled up the commitment paperwork,"" Weinstein said. The documents do not say why Cruz was not committed under the Baker Act or whether he may not have qualified for other reasons. The law allows a law enforcement officer such as Peterson to initiate commitment under the Baker Act. An attorney for Peterson did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Sunday. Cruz, 19, is charged in a 34-count indictment with killing 17 people and wounding 17 others in the attack. He faces the death penalty if convicted, but his public defender Melisa McNeill has said he would plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence. In the Henderson Behavioral Health documents, Cruz's mother Lynda is quoted as saying she had fresh concerns about her son's mental state after he punched holes in a wall at their home in Parkland. The clinicians at Henderson came to the home for interviews and said Cruz admitted punching the wall but said he did so because he was upset at a breakup with his girlfriend. Cruz also admitted cutting his arm with a pencil sharpener. After a Sept. 28, 2016 interview, the documents say Cruz ""reports that he cut his arms 3-4 weeks ago and states that this is the only time he has ever cut. (Cruz) states that he cut because he was lonely, states that he had broken up with his girlfriend and reports that his grades had fallen. (Cruz) states that he is better now, reports that he is no longer lonely and states that his grades have gone back up."" He also told the clinician he owned only a pellet gun and was not capable of doing ""serious harm"" to anyone. The documents show that Cruz was very much on the radar screen of mental health professionals and the Broward County school system, yet very little appears to have been done other than these evaluations. Other red flags have also surfaced, including calls to the FBI about Cruz's potential to become a school shooter and numerous visits by county law enforcement officials to his home - both before his mother died in November and after, when he lived briefly with a family friend in Palm Beach County. Again, very little was done. It's not clear from the documents who the recommendation was forwarded to or why it was not followed up. ___ Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt",Stoneman Douglas High School shooting  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School School shooting 2018 United States gun violence protests Shooting Student Gun Gun violence Gun control,"A student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Feb. 14, the day after a gunman killed 14 students and a school employees.",MIAMI (AP) -- Documents show some officials were so concerned about the mental stability of the student accused of last month's Florida high school rampage that they decided he should be forcibly committed.

The White House established the commission after a shooter in Parkland, Fla., killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and injured 17 others.

The commission also looked at boosting security by arming school employees. But the White House instructed the commission to only consider whether the country should increase age limits for gun purchases. Trump has vacillated on the issue of age restrictions for firearms purchasing. He once said he would give ""serious thought"" to raising age limits. He tweeted later that states should deal with the policy on their own. The commission, which has met more than a dozen times, invited mostly Republican guests, The Post reported.

In some instances during the drill, the Public Announcement system, which Mead said dates back to the 1950s, failed. “We ended up running down hallways to shout ‘Lockdown!’” he remembered. Perhaps worse, when a human resources employee tried to make an announcement to prompt the active shooter drill, he picked up the phone and dialed the wrong code and locked himself in a room. Mead explained how a stress factor kicks in, which he leads to instances of bungled dialing or botching a critical prewritten script. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now “With him locked out, everyone is standing around wondering ‘Why isn’t our school locked down,’” he said. Mead quickly upgraded the PA system. Now, he said, if you dial “8303” at any of the Glen Lake Schools, a loud pulse blares and a prerecorded message warns faculty, students to “Lock the doors and stay away from the windows.” When Mead and his boss Glen Lake Community Schools Superintendent Sander Scott evaluated their poor marks, they decided to overhaul the entire security system. By the end of September, with the help of federal taxpayer dollars, the Glen Lake Community Schools will have Michigan’s first gunshot sensor security system. “Ever since I came to Glen Lake I've been getting formal some informal suggestions from parents grandparents, comm members about the need to beef up our security,” Superintendent Scott said in an interview with Newsweek. The tech purports to detect an armed intruder and potential spent ammunition rounds in real-time. Siemens Building Technologies won out a Request For Proposal bidding process with a bottom line estimate of $156,000. The monies made it possible to put in place the “Guardian Indoor Active Shooter Detection System” -- which its parent company website dubs it to be the “most accurate gunshot detection technology available today” and known to be able to rely on “military grade” sensors and software to pinpoint where shots are fired in a building. CEO of Shooter Detection Systems Christian Connors boasted that the system has been operational “for over 26 million hours without a single false alert” in schools, airports, manufacturing sites and other complex environments. The need for gunshot detection was inspired by national experts and even firefighters -- who Scott credits for meting out fire-related fatalities in school buildings. “You have smoke detectors that are constantly sniffing for smoke if, you will,” he said. “Now we have shot detectors which are constantly listening for a gunshot or looking for the flash of gunpowder.” Mark Wilson/Getty Images Both Mead and Scott pointed to a convergence of three specific events from last year that pushed them to radically revamp the school system’s security apparatus. On Valentine’s Day, a total of 17 students and teachers attending the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, were shot dead by a former student identified as Nikolas Cruz who was armed with an AR-15-style rifle. A month later, James Eric Davis Jr., 19, was arrested a short time after allegedly shooting his parents at his dorm room located at Western Michigan University. Days after that attack, Scott said local authorities and the school district thwarted a student at one of the schools who allegedly made “credible” threats and also had “access to an AR-15.” “I had some internal motivation, but I also had a public mandate to really dig in and do something a little more intense than what’s been done previously,” he said. Scott also notes that he’s not just trying to make the school safe with technology alone. He has put in place counselors, and an anonymous tip line as well as other psychological and emotional programs to help kids cope with what is now the new normal in compulsory learning institutions. “We’re not done,” Scott said. “We’re not seeing this as a panacea. We’re seeing this as a great next step.”""",Image  Connecticut Photography Getty Images Statue Photograph Stock photography News Half-mast,The Glen Lake Community Schools in Michigan is the first school in the country to have a system that can be used to monitor a gunman and a shooting suspect.,"""“It was like watching a trainwreck,” Marcus Mead, the district’s Director of Administration and Instructional Technology told Newsweek.

33,33,265,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-parkland-shooting-report-20180803-story.html,"Florida school failed Parkland shooter, report says","The Broward school district mishandled the case of student Nikolas Cruz when he asked for special help, long before he killed 17 staff and students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to a long-awaited report released Friday. For the first time, the report revealed that Cruz had asked to return to the district’s special education program, which would have provided him more support than he received as a general student, the report says. The report, by the Collaborative Educational Network of Tallahassee, found that the school district largely followed the policies and laws in place when educating Cruz, but failed on two occasions. Exactly how is not clear. Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer ruled Friday that the 46-page report could be released to the public, but much of the content was blacked out, apparently including any details that would explain the district’s mistakes. The Broward school district recommended the report be altered to comply with the shooter’s educational and medical privacy rights. Advertisement Of the report’s 1,707 lines, 1,078 of them — or about 64% — are concealed. After rejecting special education, Cruz quickly failed. Three days after he was forced by the district to withdraw from the Parkland school, he purchased an AR-15. A year after his ejection, he returned and gunned down 14 students and three adults. Cruz’s attorneys argued unsuccessfully in court that the report would hinder his right to a fair trial. Scherer agreed with attorneys for the South Florida Sun Sentinel and other media outlets, who argued the taxpayer-funded report should not be hidden from view. In a written statement, Broward Schools Supt. Robert Runcie said he looked forward to releasing the full report “as soon as it is legally appropriate.” He said the review shows that the district’s “systems are appropriate” and that the district worked consistently “to provide an education and ongoing, changing behavioral care for Cruz throughout his time in the Broward school system.” Advertisement The report, however, suggests the district did not follow laws or policies in place when school employees tried to transfer Cruz, then a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, to a special education campus. Cruz, then 18, refused and removed himself from the special education program. Runcie has said that when Cruz made that decision, the district was unable to help him with special education services. But the consultant’s report reveals for the first time that Cruz later “requested reinstatement” of special education services, and the district mishandled his request. The revelation bolsters criticism from some special education experts, who said the district should have done more for Cruz, who had emotional and behavioral problems. Advertisement Cruz’s attorneys said the $60,000 report is a “whitewash” commissioned by the school district to clear it of responsibility for how it handled Cruz’s complex psychological problems. “I think that the report is an attempt by the school board to absolve itself of any liability or responsibility for all the missed opportunities that they had in this matter,” said Gordon Weekes, the chief assistant public defender. The consultant, however, found that the district largely handled Cruz properly, over 16 years of education. “With isolated exceptions, the district adhered to procedural and substantive requirements,” the report says. Advertisement Without directly criticizing the school district, the consultant recommended the district reconsider how to handle cases like Cruz’s, where a “high-needs” special education student decides against participating in special education and then reverses the decision. The report suggests that when Cruz was a general education student, he wasn’t offered access to counseling and mental health services that are available to all students.

Police interrogated Cruz hours after the Feb. 14 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that left 17 people dead and 17 wounded, and fueled the national debate about gun control. Cruz told Broward County Sheriff’s Office detective John Curcio during his 12-hour interrogation that a “demon” voice in his head told him to “Burn. Kill. Destroy.” The voice, he claimed, directed him to buy the AR-15 used in the massacre and to take an Uber to the school. He also told Curcio that, before the Parkland shooting, he had planned to open fire on people at a park and had experienced a previous run-in with police for “shooting animals.” He told police he had made two past attempts on his own life, one with Ibuprofen and one with alcohol.* Several pages of the transcript have been redacted. At varying points during the interview, Cruz talked to himself, contradicted his own statements, and requested a psychologist. He became defensive when Curcio expressed doubt about the “voice” in his head. “Personally, I think you’re using the demon as an excuse,” the police detective said. “You could have stopped the demon any time you want. You didn’t want to stop the demon … I think you like the demon.” After disputing that claim, Cruz asked for an attorney. When Curcio left the room for a moment, Cruz said, “I want to die.” Cruz’s brother Zachary was brought into the room later in the interview, saying, “People think you’re a monster now. … Why did you do this?” “I’m sorry, dude,” Cruz replied. Much of that conversation has been redacted. On the day of the shooting, Cruz was arrested in a neighborhood near the school. The Washington Post reported that Cruz had escaped the campus virtually unnoticed during the chaos that ensued. A court-ordered report, which was released on Friday and published unredacted by the Sun-Sentinel, revealed that Cruz had asked the Broward County school district for special counseling assistance months before the shooting, but the district did not follow through. Cruz has been charged with 17 counts of murder in the first degree and 17 counts of attempted murder. His defense attorneys are looking to strike a plea deal, in which Cruz would plead guilty in exchange for life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty. “He is the most damaged and broken human being I have encountered in 40 years doing this type of work,” Broward County public defender Howard Finkelstein told the Washington Post in an email. The transcript adds to a litany of evidence previously released by law enforcement, as The Washington Post points out, including footage of police responding to the crime scene, some 911 calls from the attack, and video footage of Cruz announcing his plans to become “a professional school shooter” and bragging about how it would make him famous. The release of the transcript and a video of the interrogation was ordered by a Florida judge last month.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. The heart of the National Rifle Association’s mission is to block the government from taking people’s guns. Now the Second Amendment advocacy group says the government is trying to put it out of business. The NRA said in a recent court filing that New York state’s campaign to push insurance companies and banks to cut ties with the organization had already cost it “tens of millions of dollars” this year and could ultimately make it “unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission.” Unless the courts step in and stop New York, “the NRA will suffer irrevocable loss and irreparable harm if it is unable to acquire insurance or other financial services,” the group said in a complaint submitted in federal court on July 20. Even before the fight with New York, the NRA was struggling financially, reporting a $45 million budget deficit in 2016 tax documents. Let our news meet your inbox. The news and stories that matters, delivered weekday mornings. This site is protected by recaptcha The NRA is also at the center of an FBI investigation into an accused Russian spy's efforts to influence American politics. And yet the NRA appears to remain at the peak of its powers, able to mobilize its millions of members to support state and federal political candidates who share its gun-rights agenda. It spent heavily on President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign, and now has an avowed supporter in the White House. But the NRA’s legal arguments make it appear that it is now at the edge of doom. Its lawsuit accuses New York of a “blacklisting campaign” comprised of “selective prosecution, backroom exhortations, and public threats” that “will imminently deprive the NRA of basic bank-depository services, corporate insurance coverage, and other financial services essential to the NRA’s corporate existence and its advocacy mission.” While the NRA and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo have a long history of antagonism, the current dispute relates to a set of actions he began this spring that he invited other states to join on Saturday. ""At a time when Washington has completely abdicated its responsibility to protect the American people, states must lead,"" Cuomo said. ""I am calling on states across the country to join New York to outlaw this absurd program that insures intentional criminal conduct."" Back in April, Cuomo ordered the state Department of Financial Services, which regulates all banks and insurance companies doing business in New York, to urge those companies to reconsider its ties to the NRA. The DFS complied with an industry memo that cited a public and corporate backlash against the NRA following the Feb. 14 massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida ─ essentially telling them to join the backlash. Then the DFS went after companies that did business with the NRA, fining Lockton Companies and Chubb for underwriting the NRA’s “Carry Guard” insurance, which the agency said unlawfully covered gun owners’ “acts of intentional wrongdoing.” (The NRA says the program covers members’ expenses “arising out of the lawful self-defense use of a legally possessed firearm.”) The NRA’s lawsuit accuses New York of a campaign to deprive its members of “their First Amendment rights to speak freely about gun-related issues and defend the Second Amendment.” The NRA did not respond to request for comment, but Cuomo doubled down on his position on Saturday. ""Every time there's a shooting, politicians and the NRA offer American families nothing more than thoughts and prayers,"" Cuomo said. ""If the NRA goes bankrupt because of the State of New York, they'll be in my thoughts and prayers."" The governor then concluded his Saturday statement with a pithy: ""I'll see you in court.""",National Rifle Association March for Our Lives Gun Gun control Lobbying AR-15 style rifle  Shooting United States Senate NRATV,A poster for the National Rifle Association at the National Rifle Association’s annual meeting in Washington in June.,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present Robert MacPherson/AFP/Getty Images A would-be assassin out to kill a U.S. president builds a gun out of composite materials and hides bullets in his metal, rabbit’s foot keychain as he glides through a metal detector. He then reassembles the pieces and reconstructs the gun while sitting at a table at a political fundraiser. He approaches the president and pulls the trigger. Only Clint Eastwood leaping in front of the bullet saves the fictitious president. The crowning moment in the 1993 hit film ""In the Line of Fire"" involved the John Malkovich’s villain putting together an untraceable gun, and now, lawmakers are trying to make that more difficult for others to do. The current concern stems from a legal battle over guns that can be made using 3-D printers. ""Building guns out of materials that are undetectable by security screening devices is not necessarily a new concept, but in the past it required someone with specific skills who knew how to do it,"" said John Cohen, a former police officer and Homeland Security official who is currently an ABC News contributor. ""By putting these instructions on the internet you are dramatically expanding the number of people who could build these types of guns."" The 3-D printed guns are in the spotlight now because the U.S. State Department settled a multi-year court battle with a Texas-based company that was pushing to put downloadable instructions to build guns from 3-D printed pieces online. A federal judge intervened with a restraining order. How the guns are made The weapons at the center of the legal firestorm are ones that are printed out in parts and then constructed by the user. Specialized printers are able to print out three-dimensional objects built out of plastic or resin. By following instructions that have the specifications for a gun, the user can then print the various pieces and put those together like a 3-D puzzle. But for a ""functional firearm,"" Cohen said. ""All it takes is for them to get the ammunition that you buy for any regular firearm and then start using it as a weapon,"" he said. Much like guns themselves, the costs of 3-D printers range dramatically from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Safety concerns The fact that these guns are printed at home and not by a licensed manufacturer who needs to keep records means that the weapons are untraceable in paper trails. Beyond that, they are also undetectable by metal detectors, including those used at airports and at federal buildings. The shifting aesthetic of 3-D guns, which are not necessarily black and could theoretically be any color, poses significant problems for law enforcement, Cohen said, noting that it might take longer for police to identify such a gun as a deadly weapon in a confrontational situation where every second counts. ""Depending on the appearance it could cause confusion when a police officer is trying to determine if someone is a deadly threat or not,"" he said. The background checks required in many situations where people buy guns on the open market would not apply to those buying 3-D printers, which can be used for making numerous objects besides guns. ""As a cop you're going to be concerned that people who would typically have a difficult time obtaining a gun might be able to manufacture a gun that they can use to commit crimes,"" Cohen said.",3D printed firearms Gun Firearm Ghost gun Defense Distributed 3D printing United States Weapon Gun safety Gun control,A 3-D printed gun made by a company that is trying to put the weapons out of parts on the Internet.,How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present The weapons have been subject to a lengthy legal case.

The NRA claims in a lawsuit, obtained and first reported by Rolling Stone, that the state of New York sought to hurt the organization by urging financial institutions and insurers not to work with the gun group. ADVERTISEMENT The organization is suing New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), the state’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) and Maria Vullo, New York’s superintendent of financial services. An amended version of the complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in New York last month. The lawsuit stems from a May decision by New York financial regulators over “Carry Guard,” an NRA-marketed insurance policy for members who face legal costs after firing a gun legally. The DFS determined that the policy was illegal under New York state law and that the insurers who provided it must stop selling the policies and pay a $7 million fine. The NRA alleges that the decision, along with ""threats"" by Cuomo, also pressured insurers to drop other policies tied to the gun group. William Brewer, an attorney for the NRA, told The Hill in an emailed statement that the gun group “is suffering setbacks with respect to the availability of insurance and banking services — as a result of a political and discriminatory campaign meant to coerce financial institutions to refrain from doing business with the NRA.” Brewer called the actions of Cuomo and the financial regulators “a blatant attack on the First Amendment rights of our organization,” adding that they “will further harm the NRA, chill the commercial activities of institutions regulated by DFS, and penalize law-abiding New York insurance consumers.” In response, Cuomo's office announced Friday afternoon that New York would be filing a motion to dismiss the NRA's lawsuit against the state, asserting that Cuomo and the state's actions were not in violation of the groups' First Amendment rights. “New York we will not be intimidated by the NRA’s frivolous lawsuit to advance its dangerous gun-peddling agenda,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Donald Trump Donald John TrumpTrump says he would be comfortable sending son, grandchildren to school in person Cafeteria worker on White House grounds tests positive for COVID-19: reports Republicans to start unveiling coronavirus package Thursday MORE and Washington, DC may be bought and paid for by the NRA, but in New York we are listening to the voices of people across the nation calling for action to keep our communities safe. While the NRA tries to play the victim, New York stands with the real victims — the thousands of people whose lives are cut short by gun violence every year.” Cuomo has previously called the NRA's lawsuit “a futile and desperate attempt to advance its dangerous agenda to sell more guns.” The gun rights organization also states that it has lost insurance coverage after its carrier said it “was unwilling to renew coverage at any price.” The lawsuit alleges that the NRA may be forced to shut down NRATV and other publications after it lost its media liability coverage. The group claims that it could lose access to financial services because “multiple banks” are distancing themselves from the NRA “based on concerns that any involvement with the NRA — even providing the organization with basic depository services — would expose them to regulatory reprisals.” ""If the NRA is unable to collect donations from its members, safeguard the assets endowed to it, apply its funds to cover media buys and other expenses integral to its political speech, and obtain basic corporate insurance coverage, it will be unable to exist as a not-for-profit or pursue its advocacy mission,"" the complaint states. The NRA cites Cuomo's past statements and actions against the NRA, claiming that for him ""weakening the political advocacy of the NRA is a career strategy."" New York officials are moving ""to coerce insurance agencies, insurers, and banks into terminating business relationships with the NRA that were necessary to the survival of the NRA as a charitable organization,"" the filing alleges. Financial issues are not new for the NRA: The group overspent by nearly $46 million in 2016, according to Rolling Stone. The group has faced intense scrutiny after several mass shootings, most notably at a Parkland, Fla., high school. Student activists from the school publicly associated the pro-gun group with lawmaker inaction on gun control. The NRA cited the backlash the organization has faced in the wake of the tragedies in the lawsuit, including a tweet from Cuomo urging businesses in New York to reconsider their ties to the group.

Levi Strauss’s CEO and President Chip Bergh wrote in Fortune on Tuesday that the company “simply cannot stand by silently when it comes to issues that threaten the very fabric of the communities where we live and work.” “You may wonder why a company that doesn’t manufacture or sell guns is wading into this issue, but for us, it’s simple,” Bergh wrote. “Americans shouldn’t have to live in fear of gun violence. It’s an issue that affects all of us — all generations and all walks of life."" ADVERTISEMENT Bergh said it was his responsibility to speak up for important issues since he leads a “values-drive company that’s known the world over as a pioneer of the American West and one of the great symbols of American freedom.” He added that he is not advocating to repeal the 2nd Amendment nor calling gun owners irresponsible. ""We can’t insulate ourselves from every threat,"" Bergh wrote. ""We can’t 'harden' every place we gather — whether it be our schools, workplaces, shops, churches, or entertainment venues. But we can take common-sense, measurable steps — like criminal background checks on all gun sales — that will save lives."" Levi's, therefore, announced a new three-tiered initiative to support gun violence prevention. The company will donate more than $1 million over the next four years to nonprofits and youth activists that work to end gun violence, establishing the “Safer Tomorrow Fund.” The blue jean manufacturer also partnered with gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety and other executives to form Everytown Business Leaders for Gun Safety. Bergh called the group a coalition of business leaders who “believe, as we do, that business has a critical role to play in and a moral obligation to do something about the gun violence epidemic in this country.” Levi’s will also double all donations made by their employees to the Safer Tomorrow Fund.

Florida’s Stoneman Douglas High School pupils, who formed March for Our Lives in the aftermath of the February shooting that left 17 students and staff dead, travelled to South Africa to receive the International Children’s Peace Prize. Previous recipients included Pakistani girls’ education activist Malala Yousafzai and Nkosi Johnson, a South African child who fought for the rights of children with HIV. At the event in Cape Town, held to coincide with Universal Children’s Day, Bishop Desmond Tutu told representatives of the group – David Hogg, Emma González, Jaclyn Corin, Matt Deitsch, Ryan Deitsch and Delaney Tarr – their work to persuade young people to become more engaged in confronting the crisis was among the most significant youth-led mass movements in living memory. “The peaceful campaign to demand safe schools and communities, and the eradication of gun violence, is reminiscent of other great peace movements in history,” said Mr Tutu, who is patron of the KidsRights Foundation, which has organised the award for 15 years and this year oversaw 121 children from 45 countries nominated. “I am in awe of these children whose powerful message is amplified by their youthful energy and an unshakable belief that children can, no must, improve their own futures.” During the ceremony, Marc Dullaert, founder of KidsRights and the International Children’s Peace Prize, called on the international community to halt the surge in school violence witnessed internationally. “Schools must be protected as safe havens for children. KidsRights calls upon the international community to halt this issue and to prevent schools from becoming battlegrounds,” he said. Speaking from Cape Town, the six young people told The Independent they had been inspired by their visit to South Africa and the chance to meet previous recipients. Story continues “It’s an absolute honour to be up here with some incredible young people who have risen to the occasion time and time again,” said Matt Deitsch, who dropped out of college to work for the movement after the shooting, which his sister and younger brother survived. “We have only been doing this for nine months, and to be here in this room with all of them was just incredible.” The young people, who helped organise protests across the US and around the world, highlighted the National Rifle Association’s funding of many members of congress, and held a rally in Washington DC to urge young people to become more involved. While their efforts were widely praised, some on the right accused them of being naive. Conspiracy theorists even claimed the young people who had survived, after gunman Nikolas Cruz (a former student at the school) entered the premises and opened fire, were actors. The young people, including Mr Hogg and Ms González, gained support nationwide as they continued to press politicians with both passion and hard facts. “We are going to be the last mass shooting,“ Ms González told a crowd days after the shooting. “We are going to change the law. That’s going to be Marjory Stoneman Douglas in that textbook, and it’s all going to be due to the tireless efforts of the school board, the faculty members, the family members and most importantly the students.” Given that the group said it had struggled to engage with lots of Republican members of congress who had received funding from the NRA, Ms González was asked what message she might have for Nancy Pelosi. After Democrats flipped the House of Representatives in the midterm elections, it is likely the 78-year-old will become speaker and the Democrats will have the opportunity to craft legislation. “We’re saying to anyone who would listen to us, not just Nancy Pelosi but the entire government at this point,” said Ms González. Included among the 10-point plan listed on the group’s website is a demand to disarm domestic abusers, put in place tougher security for guns, introduce universal background checks, and provide grants for research into gun violence for the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Yet, the young people said the changes needed were not simply legislative. Ryan Deitsch said the group had to continue trying to challenge the root of gun culture. “We have a culture that we have to fight, which is very much a culture centred around guns and making them as normalised as possible in society – and that is not just in America but around the world. That is something that we have to combat. That is something we have been combatting slowly,” he said. “That is something we are going to combat politically, but we have to combat this culture. And the way we do that is working with out chapters around the country and around the world. This work is not going to end any time soon that we can see, but we are prepared for the long haul.”",Emma Gonzalez David Hogg Dana Loesch Cameron Kasky Jaclyn Corin Stoneman Douglas High School shooting March for Our Lives Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School 2018 United States gun violence protests Gun control,"Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday.","Students who launched a campaign to tackle gun violence in America – and who have received an international peace award for their efforts – have urged the new congress to take up the challenge and work with them.

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Related: Republican Senate candidate praises Hitler and prompts condemnation from California GOP Patriot Front has demonstrable links to the anti-immigrant, anti-Semitic alt-right movement. The group splintered from Vanguard America, which appeared prominently at the deadly 'Unite the Right' rally in Charlottesville, Virginia in August of 2017. There, James Fields, a 20-year-old man who appeared at the rally alongside Vanguard America, allegedly drove his car into a crowd of anti-racist protesters, which led to the death of 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Following that incident, and the national furor that it unleashed, alt-right leadership went into a period of rebranding—in order to distance itself from symbols like swastikas, which appeared in photographs that were taken at 'Unite the Right.' The neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer and other alt-right hubs began promoting the idea of 'American nationalism' in the fall of 2017. The propagandistic language was an attempt to inject images of traditional Americana into neo-Nazi politics in order to make the ideology more palatable to mainstream conservatives, leaders said. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Patriot Front expanded partially due to that change in branding, although the Southern Poverty Law Center has suggested that the group’s origins were first spotted back in 2015. Patriot Front now has a network of neo-Nazi cells that stretches across the entire country, SPLC noted . Unicorn Riot, a decentralized, non-profit media collective, published troves of internal chats and audio recordings the group engaged in on Discord, a gaming app that has served as a popular communication tool for neo-Nazis in recent years. In those chats the group spoke glowingly of rape and other violent acts, echoing the kind of rhetoric commonly promoted on Daily Stormer and other hubs that are popular with the darker corners of the alt-right movement. One member of the group talked about promoting 'patriotic American imagery' in the chats, something that would create 'plausible deniability' about their links to neo-Nazism, according to the documents released by Unicorn Riot. Zak was released on $150 bond and his next court date was set for May 17, according to the Chicago Sun-Times .""",Unite the Right rally Charlottesville White supremacy Racism White nationalism Demonstration Protest Nazism  Neo-Nazism,"Jakub F.

The ordinance was approved after an AP story investigating the reselling of confiscated guns. That report concluded that many of the guns sold by the police were used for new crimes. The ordinance to prohibit the sales passed 6-1 Monday. Instead of selling guns that are confiscated, police will have to dispose of them. “Disposing of long guns and assault rifles is a sensible approach,” Councilwoman Candace Mumm told the AP. “Instead of spending time recycling weapons, our police staff can get back to the primary mission of solving crimes and protecting the public.” ADVERTISEMENT Spokane is the second city to ban law enforcement arms sales after the AP's report, following King County in Washington, which passed a similar ordinance on Oct. 2. Between 2011 and 2018, the forfeited firearms sales generated $16,787 for Spokane, according to the ordinance. Those sales ranged from $633 to about $7,488 in any given year. “We may actually be costing the city coffers by reselling and recycling the guns,"" Mumm explained to AP. The text of the ordinance reads as follows: “The City of Spokane intends to do all it can to prevent and reduce violent crime in Spokane and has determined that destroying all seized or forfeited firearms rather than reselling them to the public or to gun dealers is a simple, sensible and effective way to reduce access to firearms and help reduce and prevent gun violence.”",Firearm Gun control Gun National Instant Criminal Background Check System Handgun Gun shop Background check Universal background check Rifle Concealed carry,"A gun used by the police in Spokane, Wash., in 2012.","The city of Spokane passed a city ordinance on Tuesday banning police from selling confiscated guns, according to The Associated Press.

The video confirmed Bush's presence, Rogers said. The church is headed by a black pastor and has a large African-American membership. Bush ""appeared to try to gain access to the church,"" Rogers said. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox The information came as news media outlets reported that Bush made a racial comment after the deadly shooting at a Kroger in Jeffersontown, a city of about 26,600 people on the outskirts of Louisville. Rogers said it was too soon, however, to say whether the shooting was racially motivated. ""I can't speculate on motive at this time,"" the chief said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are pursuing all avenues of the investigation no matter where that takes us or what it involves."" The FBI announced it ""is evaluating the evidence to determine if there were any violations of federal law."" Hate crimes are prosecuted under federal law. More than 100 people gathered outside Kroger store Thursday night to pay tribute to the victims, reports CBS Louisville affiliate WLKY-TV. Scene from vigil on October 25, 2018 for two victims of fatal shooting at Korger grocery store in Jeffersontown, Kentucky the day before WLKY-TV Friends and family members of the victims told the station they found comfort in the gathering. ""This helped to renew my faith in human kindness -- this movement, this beautiful thing,"" said Kevin Gunn, the nephew of one of them. Chief Rogers said Bush apparently does have a history of mental illness, as news outlets have reported. An arrest report says Bush walked into the Kroger, pulled a gun from his waist and shot a man in the back of the head, then kept shooting him multiple times ""as he was down on the floor."" The report says Bush then reholstered his gun, walked outside and killed a woman in the parking lot. Each victim died of multiple gunshot wounds, Rogers said. A man carrying a concealed weapon who happened to be in the parking lot challenged Bush, and police say the suspect then ""began firing wildly"" at him, putting other shoppers in the parking lot in danger. Neither man was hurt in that confrontation, Rogers said. Bystander video shows a white man in a distinctive neon-yellow shirt trying to drive away while an officer chases after him on foot. Many more officers converged on the scene and made the arrest just a few hundred yards from the store Wednesday afternoon. Bush was jailed on $5 million bond Thursday on two counts of murder and 10 counts of felony wanton endangerment. Ed Harrell was quoted by the Courier Journal of Louisville as saying he was waiting for his wife in the parking lot when he heard gunshots and grabbed his revolver. As he crouched down, he said he saw the gunman walk ""nonchalantly"" by with a gun by his side. Harrell said he called out to ask what was going on, and the gunman replied: ""Don't shoot me. I won't shoot you. Whites don't shoot whites."" Rogers said police ""are aware of that statement and are evaluating any factors that may come into play with"" it. He said he had ""no direct knowledge"" of whether there was more than one armed bystander at the scene. The local coroner's office identified the victims as Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vicki Lee Jones, 67. Police said there didn't appear to be any connection between Bush and the victims, or any link between Bush and the Kroger store. Stallard's 12-year-old grandson was shopping with him in the store when he was gunned down, Jeffersontown Mayor Bill Dieruf said Thursday. The boy was physically unharmed, but most certainly traumatized, the mayor said, adding, ""He was there and cannot unsee what he has seen."" Stallard was the father of Kellie Watson, the chief racial equity officer for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. The mayor shared his outrage Thursday over what he called an ""epidemic of gun violence"" that ""hit close to home."" ""People getting shot at a grocery store, a school, outside a church. Can't we all agree that that is unacceptable?"" said Fischer, a Democrat running for re-election. Authorities removed computers and cellphones from the house where Bush lived with his parents. Bush's criminal record shows he threatened his ex-wife and punched a deputy sheriff during a family court hearing years ago. He also was charged with assaulting his elderly parents in January 2009. An arrest citation said Bush's parents were punched and choked, and they told police they were ""terrified of (his) unpredictable behavior.""",Maurice Stallard Jeffersontown Kroger shooting Jeffersontown  Suspect Kroger  Hate crime Louisville Shooting,"A police photo of the suspect, Gregory Bush, in a photo released by the Jeffersontown Police Department.","JEFFERSONTOWN, Ky. -- A white man with a history of violence and mental illness was recorded on surveillance video apparently trying to get inside a predominantly black church in Kentucky before he went to a grocery store and fatally shot two African-Americans, police said After releasing a photo of the suspect, authorities received a tip from an employee of the city of Jeffersontown who said he thought he saw Gregory Bush outside the First Baptist church prior to Wednesday's shooting, city police chief Sam Rogers said.

The Milwaukee Bucks also went through warmups wearing the shirts, whose message echoed the “Enough” helmet stickers both the Los Angeles Kings and Minnesota Wild wore at Staples Center on Thursday night. The shirts weren’t the only statement made by the Clippers on Saturday. The shooting at the Borderline Bar & Grill had left the organization “heartbroken,” the in-arena announcer said before a moment of silence. Advertisement “The politicians have it on pre-dial now,” Clippers coach Doc Rivers said of their offers of “thoughts and prayers.” “They say the same thing and we don’t do anything,” Rivers said. “I like that we voted. It was a big outcome and I think in two years, we’ve got to do it even more. I think that’s important to send messages and get things done. I think that’s the only way we can make change right now. “It’s sad. Mental Illness is sad, but [lack of] gun control is sadder. This whole thing about, ‘I guess it wasn’t a terrorist attack,’ just infuriates me. If that was your child, I’d bet they think it was a terrorist attack.” Forward Tobias Harris said the entire locker room was supportive of wearing the shirts. Advertisement “As basketball players we have a platform to express our voice and our opinion about it and we believe it’s something that has to be brought up and get under control,” Harris said. “At the end of the day action has to be taken from this because there can be only so many prayers and so many condolences that go out. Action has to take place.” Butler gives Philly a ‘closer’ News of Minnesota’s proposed trade of Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia broke Saturday morning — “four or five days” after Rivers discussed it with Tom Thibodeau, his former assistant who is Minnesota’s coach and team president. “I would say this, it gives [Philadelphia] a closer,” Rivers said. “Jimmy Butler’s a closer and every good team has to have one of those. Before the season started that was the question, you know. At the end of the game if you can get it to [Joel] Embiid at the right spot he can close but bigs are tough so now they actually have a closer and that’s going to make them really good. “You think of the games they lost this year and last year, last three minutes, four minutes, because they couldn’t close games. Now they have Jimmy, that’s going to make a big difference.” Advertisement Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, whose team joined Toronto as the class of the Eastern Conference through the season’s first three weeks, was less interested in considering how Butler’s addition might benefit Philadelphia. “It’s for the Sixers to figure out,” he said. “I’m sure it’ll make them better.” The trade, which wouldn’t become official until Monday, ends nearly two months of speculation that followed Butler’s trade demand. The Clippers were reportedly a destination the All-Star guard preferred, but the teams hadn’t held substantive trade talks in weeks, according to a source not authorized to speak publicly. Etc. Clippers forward Danilo Gallinari’s streak of consecutive free throws made ended at 55 after a miss in the second quarter Saturday. Gallinari also made his 900th career three-pointer. … Avery Bradley missed his third consecutive game because of an ankle injury and Luc Mbah a Moute his eighth straight because of a sore left knee.

During the program's “Unplugged” segment, Noah addressed the recent shooting at a mall in Hoover, Ala. that left one dead and two wounded on Thanksgiving night. The person killed by police, 21-year-old black Army veteran Emantic Bradford Jr., who was legally carrying a gun, was mistaken for the shooter and the real shooter could still be at large. “The question I ask myself is how does this s**t keep happening? Cops are called into a situation, they see a black person, and then immediately they shoot,” Noah told his audience. “That’s what they did here. They ran in, they shot the guy, and then they were like ‘We got him.’” ""How many times have we seen a shooter who is white and a man get talked down?” he asked, citing the shooters in Aurora and Charleston. While noting other shooters have killed themselves, Noah said when it comes to black men, it’s “shoot immediately” and “ask questions later.” 'If you’re a black man, you have no business bearing arms at all' — Trevor Noah “There are so many things that bug me about this story. Because by the looks of it, it sounds like this was a good guy with a gun. That’s what they always say, a ‘good guy with a gun stops the crime,’” Noah continued. “But if the good guy with a gun happens to be a black good guy with a gun, they don’t get any of the benefits.” The late-night comedian slammed the Hoover Police Department for their statement declaring they got the shooter, a statement they later apologized for, and how multiple people had reportedly pulled out their guns but that the “only person who was shot by police was a black guy.” Trevor Noah: Trump's 'superhuman stupidity' led president to discount his own administration's climate report “At this point, you start to realize that really the Second Amendment is not intended for black people,” Noah said. “It’s an uncomfortable thing to say, but it’s the truth. Like people will be like ‘the right to bear arms.’ Yes, the right to bear arms if you’re not a black man. If you’re a black man, you have no business bearing arms at all."" The “Daily Show” host also cited a recent incident involving a black security guard who was shot and killed after being mistaken for an armed assailant. “If you’re black and you’re a man in America, gun rights are not for you,” Noah reiterated. “If you’re a black person in America, gun rights are not for you. It’s as simple as that. In fact, the safest way to sell a black person a gun in America is to say that when you buy a gun you should buy a white person with it and they hold the gun for you.” “Some bulls**t, but it’s the truth,” he added. “Second Amendment was not made for black folks. “",The Daily Show Trevor Noah Television presenter Late-night talk show Late night television Comedian Television Television show Comedy Central,"Trevor Noah said that when the Second Amendment was not intended for black people, it’s not intended for black people.","The “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah got serious Tuesday night on the subjects of guns, police and race.

The Campaign Legal Center and Giffords, the nonprofit political arm of former Rep. Gabby Giffords’s (D-Ariz.) organization, said it is filing the complaint on Friday or Monday. The complaint is being filed after the Daily Beast published audio it obtained that suggests Rosendale knew the NRA would be involved in the marquee Senate race, saying it had obtained it from an unspecified July event in Washington, D.C. ADVERTISEMENT Campaign finance law bars groups that make independent expenditures from coordinating on spending with a candidate. But candidates are allowed to court groups like the NRA for their endorsements. In the audio recording, an unidentified man is heard asking, “Have outside groups been spending money on your behalf?” Rosendale, who’s challenging Sen.

The Supreme Court confirmations are big. That’s what sent the NRA over the line,” Rosendale says. But it's unclear which specific involvement or activity from the NRA Rosendale is referring to. Rosendale adds that the Supreme Court vacancy is a big issue that’s leading to the NRA's interest in the race. Rosendale later said that Chris Cox, the NRA’s top political strategist for its Institute for Legislative Action, conveyed to him the NRA's interest in getting involved. “Because in ’12, with [Republican Senate nominee Denny Rehberg] they stayed out, they stayed out of Montana. But Chris Cox told me, he’s like, ‘We’re going to be in this race,’” Rosendale said. The NRA-ILA ended up launching a $400,000 TV ad buy in early September opposing Tester, taking aim at his record on guns and noting that he backed Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor and voted against confirming Justice Neil Gorsuch. But the NRA also endorsed Rosendale around that same time. Rosendale’s campaign is pushing back on what they call a “baseless” story, saying that the Republican state auditor was discussing how Rosendale had sought the NRA’s endorsement, which is legal. “This is amusing desperation on Jon Tester’s part and it's completely baseless. The only thing this audio proves is that Matt sought the endorsement of the NRA — and we're proud to have it,” a Rosendale spokesman said in a statement. “Matt and the NRA have never discussed anything beyond the organization’s membership and endorsement process. If Jon Tester is so desperate to save his seat, perhaps he should focus more on fighting for Montana and defending our Second Amendment rights rather than spreading lies about our campaign."" The NRA also categorically denied having discussed any coordination with the Rosendale campaign. ""At no time did NRA-ILA discuss any communications or activities beyond our membership with Matt Rosendale or his campaign. Any assertion otherwise is completely false,"" Jennifer Baker, director of public affairs at the NRA-ILA, told The Hill in a statement. However, one of the groups filing the complaint says it suspects Rosendale was referring to coordination between the NRA and the candidate's campaign. “The language that Rosendale uses in there seems clear to me to be an indication of coordination,” said David Pucino, a lawyer who's involved in filing the FEC complaint on behalf of Giffords's group. Pucino added that Rosendale “seems to clearly indicate that they will be ‘coming in’ and spending,” which “seems a clear discussion of coordination, not merely endorsing,"" pointing out how Rosendale had been responding to a question about whether outside groups had been spending money on the candidate's behalf. But Brad Smith, a former Republican FEC commissioner who was nominated by President Clinton, said he doesn't believe this is coordination. He added that based on the transcript of the audio, it didn’t appear that Rosendale and his campaign were involved in “crafting the message” of the ad. “There’s nobody following politics for more than 30 seconds that doesn’t know that in Montana, gun rights and the Supreme Court nomination are going to be important issues,” Smith told The Hill. “It doesn’t rise to that level of material involvement in the kind of plans of sharing information and working in concert.” Meanwhile, Tester’s campaign said in a statement that the Daily Beast story raises “serious concerns” and shows a “troubling pattern” of Rosendale on campaign finance laws. ""This audio raises serious concerns about potential illegal coordination between Matt Rosendale and an outside, dark money group coming into Montana to support him,” said Chris Meagher, a Tester campaign spokesman. “At a minimum, this is just the latest in a troubling pattern of Matt Rosendale playing fast and loose with campaign finance laws.""

Phil Murphy (D) on Monday introduced a variety of measures aimed at strengthening the state's gun laws, a move that came just days after a mass shooting at a Pittsburgh-area synagogue left 11 people dead. “No matter how strong we think our gun laws are, we must always look to close loopholes that escaped our prior efforts,” Murphy said at a news conference in Trenton, N.J., according to The Wall Street Journal. ADVERTISEMENT Murphy said he would work with the legislature and the state attorney general’s office to pass measures that would prevent individuals who aren't allowed to purchase firearms from buying ammunition and to require purchasers to show a photo identification when buying ammunition. Murphy's announcement came after a shooter opened fire at the Pittsburgh-area Tree of Life synagogue on Saturday, leaving 11 dead and six others wounded. The Journal notes that Murphy is also proposing a $15 million grant program that would support violence-intervention efforts in certain parts of New Jersey. The program would be funded by private, federal and state money. Murphy's statement comes months after he signed six bills to tighten the state's gun control laws. At the time, Murphy said the laws would honor the victims of the Pulse night club shooting in Orlando, Fla. The measures included requirements for background checks on private gun sales, the reduction of magazine capacity, a ban on armor-piercing bullets, and keeping “guns out of the wrong hands.” State Assemblyman Lou Greenwald (D) told the Journal that he hoped the new proposals would pass the legislature within three months. Robert Bowers, 46, has been charged in connection with Saturday's shooting, which has been dubbed the deadliest attack against Jews in American history by the Anti-Defamation League.

113,113,482,http://www.yahoo.com/news/us-crypto-anarchist-sees-3d-printed-guns-fundamental-040318092.html,US 'crypto-anarchist' sees 3D-printed guns as fundamental right,"Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide. A federal court judge blocked Texan Cody Wilson's website on Tuesday by issuing a temporary injunction. Eight states had sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a ""lone wolf"" gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons. Wilson complied with the judge's order and shut down his Defcad website, which he wanted to turn into the ""WikiLeaks of guns."" But by then, the blueprints he had posted -- after President Donald Trump's administration granted him permission to publish in a settlement to end a five-year legal battle -- had been downloaded thousands of times. ""No matter how badly I win or lose, you can download a gun from the internet,"" Wilson told AFP at the headquarters of Defense Distributed, the company he runs out of a modest factory in Texas capital Austin. ""This attempt by these authorities to go into court and stifle this information drove more people to the website to download it and spread it deeper into the internet."" Sporting a pair of gray jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, the 30-year-old with a close-cropped beard wouldn't appear out of place as a tech executive in Silicon Valley. The ideology he says he is driven by is a defense of the US constitution's first and second amendments -- the rights to free speech and to bear arms. Wilson believes the intense media attention he generated cemented one of his principal goals: to use technology and the spread of gun-making information as a permanent bulwark against any future attempts at gun control in the US. ""We believe that the firearm itself, this implement of violence, is an essential component of force, of sovereignty,"" he says. He concedes that what he has done, and still wants to do, ""offends the conscience"" of some people, but he says ""it's never been illegal in this country to make a firearm -- and the way that you make it shouldn't affect that law."" Story continues - Anarchist philosophy - Wilson subscribes to an anarchist philosophy that the free exchange of ideas on the internet -- in its absolute form -- is a check on government. ""It's a politics that predicted WikiLeaks, predicted Bitcoin, predicted anonymous mail and anonymous communications online,"" he says. The law school dropout has dedicated the last five years of his life to the cause of unfettered online access to gun-making information. ""I'm a publisher. At the end of the day, I do many things, but the main thing that I strive to do is to take my information and put it on the internet,"" he says. Defense Distributed, the company Wilson co-founded in 2013 and currently heads, is more than a publishing firm -- it sells actual firearms products. It has created a machine called the ""Ghost Gunner,"" priced at $2,000. Computer code operates the machine, which carves essential components of various firearms to create weapons without serial numbers. - 'Ghost guns' - Such weapons -- called ""ghost guns"" -- are already being made by those who can properly carve metal components. The ""Ghost Gunner"" takes away the need for advanced skill and creates untraceable weapons. The issue is far from academic. The Los Angeles Police Department last month showcased a trove of ""ghost"" weapons it recovered from gang members. Law enforcement cannot trace these weapons if they are used to commit crimes. That is why lawmakers, law enforcement personnel, gun control groups and even Trump himself expressed everything from panic to skepticism this week when Wilson started distributing blueprints online. Those blueprints included his company's own creation, the ""Liberator"" plastic gun -- a sidearm that resembles something seen on science fiction TV shows. The potential impact of Wilson's publication was worldwide. Any country with uncensored access to the internet could see its gun control measures circumvented with a click of a mouse. ""It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that 3D-printed guns are nothing short of a menace to society,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one,"" Gardiner said after the injunction. Wilson also plans to fight, just as he unsuccessfully fought in the courts for five years. The judge that ordered his website shut plans to hold a hearing on the states' lawsuit next week. Wilson put out a call for donations to fund the legal challenge, but is aware that he may be facing a losing battle. ""I believe that duty demands that I continue to fight it,"" he said, while admitting that ""I think I'll waste a lot of money.""",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distortion, at the company’s headquarters in Austin, Tex.","Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide.

Enough already.","It was written by Heidi L. Pottinger, director of clinical investigations in the Department of Health Promotion Sciences at the University of Arizona College of Public Health, who argues that these drills cause trauma for children. Pottinger is also the mother of two, and both her children have been part of active-shooter drills since one was 4 months old and the other was 3 years old. She is also the founder of the nonprofit Child Health & Resilience Mastery (CHARM), Inc., as well as a Public Voices Fellow with the OpEd Project, which is a social venture founded to increase the range of voices and quality of ideas that are heard in the public square. By Heidi L. Pottinger AD AD Eleven people were murdered at Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in another mass shooting. Nothing can truly prepare us for this violence, whether in synagogues or schools. Again, we have failed to address preventable gun violence. Dec. 14 marks six years since the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting, when 20 children and six educators were killed. Since that dreadful day, tragedies like this have become horribly routine, and schools continue to practice lockdown drills. We typically associate lockdown drills with school-age children, adolescents, and staff practicing safety protocols. Sadly, infants and preschoolers also participate. AD My daughter has been included in lockdown drills since she was 4 months old. She huddles behind the diaper-changing station with her caregivers and other babies, ranging in age from 6 weeks to 15 months. Down the hall, her brother is hiding with his classmates and teacher. They have been doing this since he was 3 years old and ever since, he’s been anxiously chewing his nails, afraid to go anywhere alone inside our home without an adult. Based on my expertise as a family and child health researcher, he is clearly traumatized. AD And he’s not alone. He is one of millions of young children across the nation regularly practicing lockdown drills, huddling behind furniture and inside closets. Meanwhile, their teachers feign complete confidence, strategically managing to keep their beloved young students utterly silent while the clock ticks. Last week, my husband took our son to a football game, and, after our alma mater scored their first touchdown, they high-fived each other and hugged in celebration. When the fireworks went off, instead of marveling at the spectacle, our son began crying in terror that there was an “active shooter.” AD Those were his words. He’s 4. Children, especially those younger than 6, should not be expected to continue simulating the problem of school shootings by frequently participating in stressful lockdown drills that have not been demonstrated effective, can traumatize them, and potentially impact their education and health outcomes. AD While our children and their teachers are usually aware when a lockdown is a drill or “just pretend,” their brains do not, sending their nervous systems into fight, flight, or freeze. Except, they can only do one thing: freeze. In the short-term, their bodies are overwhelmed with adrenaline and cortisol. This type of unpredictable stress activates inflammatory responses in the body that have been shown to cause depression. For children who also might be suffering from food insecurity and/or fewer opportunities for physical activity, their ability to fight illness is compromised. AD Long-term, children are at greater risk for developing chronic illness as adults and, if they experience a life-threatening trauma, post-traumatic stress disorder. Childhood stress is also linked to lower IQ scores and academic achievement. Couple these risk factors with few or no healthy opportunities to manage stress, and lockdown drills are a recipe for disaster for our children. AD While lockdown drills provide practical value, they are not always effective — and have actually been used to inform shooters’ tactical strategies. Our government needs to treat gun violence like the public health crisis that it is. Schools need the resources to substitute burdening children and communities with lockdown drills, with positive behavioral interventions and support for parents and staff, instead. And students need opportunities to release stress hormones immediately after drills. AD Let’s equip caregivers and educators with ways to nurture each child to realize their greatness, influencing all children in a positive way. Let’s train adults on how to identify, assess and respond to threatening behaviors rather than distressing entire communities by repeatedly simulating the problem. It would be an investment in our schools and the future of every child. AD Such strengths- and evidence-based, personalized approaches might actually prompt our children to learn and be carefree at school — the way it should be — instead of forcing entire generations to hide in silence.",Image Getty Images Brittany Pollack Photography Photograph Newseum News Johns Hopkins University,"Heidi L.

Diane Black must be watching some crazy violent porn, it seems. (Photo: Aaron Bernstein / Reuters) Does anyone know what kind of porn Rep. Diane Black (R-Tenn.) is watching? Whatever it is, the 67-year-old Black, who is running for governor of Tennessee, said it’s a “big part” of what is driving the spike in school shootings. During a meeting last week with local pastors, Black raised the issue of gun violence in schools and why it keeps happening. “Pornography,” she said. “It’s available on the shelf when you walk in the grocery store. Yeah, you have to reach up to get it, but there’s pornography there,” she continued. “All of this is available without parental guidance. I think that is a big part of the root cause.” Here’s an audio of her remarks, which she made during a listening session with ministers at Safe Harbor of Clarksville, Tennessee. Black didn’t clarify what it is about porn that she thinks is leading to school massacres. Her congressional spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. Beyond naughty movies, Black said school shootings are on the rise because of the “deterioration of the family,” mental illness and violent movies. There have been 23 shootings of some type this year on the campuses of K-12 schools or colleges. Of those at the K-12 schools, nine involved a gun being discharged and people being injured or killed, including a Friday shooting in Indiana school that left a teacher and a student injured. Contrary to Black’s take, experts say poor social, economic and cultural conditions are primary drivers of gun violence. Enacting policies to improve those conditions for people, along with reducing access to firearms, would go a long way in stemming mass shootings, they say. These actions are “far more effective than all the police, doctors and hospitals combined, and intervening only after tragedies have struck,” said professors James Gilligan of New York University and Bandy Lee of Yale University, both experts on violence.

610,610,271,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-blocks-posting-of-online-plans-for-3d-printed-guns/,Judge blocks posting of online plans for 3D printed guns,"A U.S. judge in Seattle blocked the Trump administration Monday from allowing a Texas company to post online plans for making untraceable 3D guns, agreeing with 19 states and the District of Columbia that such access to the plastic guns would pose a security risk. The states sued to stop an agreement that the government had reached with Austin, Texas-based Defense Distributed, saying guidelines on how to print undetectable plastic guns could be acquired by felons or terrorists. U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik extended a temporary restraining order, and his new decision will last until the case is resolved. He said Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed, wanted to post the plans online so that citizens can arm themselves without having to deal with licenses, serial numbers and registrations. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Wilson has said that ""governments should live in fear of their citizenry."" ""It is the untraceable and undetectable nature of these small firearms that poses a unique danger,"" Lasnik said. ""Promising to detect the undetectable while at the same time removing a significant regulatory hurdle to the proliferation of these weapons - both domestically and internationally - rings hollow and in no way ameliorates, much less avoids, the harms that are likely to befall the states if an injunction is not issued."" The State Department had reached the settlement with the company after the agency removed the 3D gun-making plans from a list of weapons or technical data that cannot be exported overseas. The states argued that the federal agency didn't follow the law when it removed 3D guns from the munitions list. They said the government was supposed to notify Congress and provide a 30-day window before making a change to that list, but it did not. Lasnik criticized the government for switching its position on the threat posed by the 3D gun-making plans. Up until April, the government argued the distribution of the guidelines ""posed a threat to world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States,"" the judge said. Despite those fears, the government decided that it only needed to restrict the international availability of firearms up to .50 caliber. That's when they reached a settlement with the 3D gun company. There was no indication the government evaluated the unique characteristics of the plastic guns when it considered deleting that category of weapons from the prohibited list, the judge said. ""Nor is there any reasoned explanation for its change in position,"" Lasnik said. The federal government declined to comment on the judge's ruling. A lawyer with the U.S. Justice Department had argued against the injunction, saying possessing 3D plastic guns is already against the law, and the federal government is committed to enforcing that law. But the judge said it wasn't enough. ""While the court appreciates the earnestness with which this commitment was made at oral argument, it is of small comfort to know that, once an undetectable firearm has been used to kill a citizen of Delaware or Rhode Island or Vermont, the federal government will seek to prosecute a weapons charge in federal court while the state pursues a murder conviction in state court,"" Lasnik said.

33,33,265,http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-parkland-shooting-report-20180803-story.html,"Florida school failed Parkland shooter, report says","The Broward school district mishandled the case of student Nikolas Cruz when he asked for special help, long before he killed 17 staff and students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, according to a long-awaited report released Friday. For the first time, the report revealed that Cruz had asked to return to the district’s special education program, which would have provided him more support than he received as a general student, the report says. The report, by the Collaborative Educational Network of Tallahassee, found that the school district largely followed the policies and laws in place when educating Cruz, but failed on two occasions. Exactly how is not clear. Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer ruled Friday that the 46-page report could be released to the public, but much of the content was blacked out, apparently including any details that would explain the district’s mistakes. The Broward school district recommended the report be altered to comply with the shooter’s educational and medical privacy rights. Advertisement Of the report’s 1,707 lines, 1,078 of them — or about 64% — are concealed. After rejecting special education, Cruz quickly failed. Three days after he was forced by the district to withdraw from the Parkland school, he purchased an AR-15. A year after his ejection, he returned and gunned down 14 students and three adults. Cruz’s attorneys argued unsuccessfully in court that the report would hinder his right to a fair trial. Scherer agreed with attorneys for the South Florida Sun Sentinel and other media outlets, who argued the taxpayer-funded report should not be hidden from view. In a written statement, Broward Schools Supt. Robert Runcie said he looked forward to releasing the full report “as soon as it is legally appropriate.” He said the review shows that the district’s “systems are appropriate” and that the district worked consistently “to provide an education and ongoing, changing behavioral care for Cruz throughout his time in the Broward school system.” Advertisement The report, however, suggests the district did not follow laws or policies in place when school employees tried to transfer Cruz, then a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas, to a special education campus. Cruz, then 18, refused and removed himself from the special education program. Runcie has said that when Cruz made that decision, the district was unable to help him with special education services. But the consultant’s report reveals for the first time that Cruz later “requested reinstatement” of special education services, and the district mishandled his request. The revelation bolsters criticism from some special education experts, who said the district should have done more for Cruz, who had emotional and behavioral problems. Advertisement Cruz’s attorneys said the $60,000 report is a “whitewash” commissioned by the school district to clear it of responsibility for how it handled Cruz’s complex psychological problems. “I think that the report is an attempt by the school board to absolve itself of any liability or responsibility for all the missed opportunities that they had in this matter,” said Gordon Weekes, the chief assistant public defender. The consultant, however, found that the district largely handled Cruz properly, over 16 years of education. “With isolated exceptions, the district adhered to procedural and substantive requirements,” the report says. Advertisement Without directly criticizing the school district, the consultant recommended the district reconsider how to handle cases like Cruz’s, where a “high-needs” special education student decides against participating in special education and then reverses the decision. The report suggests that when Cruz was a general education student, he wasn’t offered access to counseling and mental health services that are available to all students.

(Reuters) - Hundreds of seniors in red caps and gowns at their Florida high school graduation ceremony on June 3 listened intently to speakers who told them what they could achieve. ""Don't let anything stop you,"" one said. But when student Joaquin Oliver's name was read out by the principal, it was his parents Manuel Oliver and Patricia Padauy who walked onto the stage to receive his diploma. Joaquin, 17, was one of the 17 students and staff members killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, 2018. The massacre by a former student who stormed classrooms on Valentine's Day with an assault rifle has spurred unprecedented activism by victims' families to prevent future gun violence. ""This Should Be My Son,"" read the words on the bright yellow t-shirt Patricia wore for the ceremony at an indoor arena in the nearby city of Sunrise. Since the mass shooting, Manuel Oliver, a 50-year-old artistic director, has traveled across the country, building murals in honor of his son. He calls the murals ""Walls of Demand."" In Los Angeles, he painted a mural with rifle targets set atop a silhouette of an image of Joaquin as he walked to school that day with a bouquet of sunflowers in his hand to give to his girlfriend. Once completed, he drove a hammer into the mural 17 times, one for each victim, and hung a sunflower in each hole. He says he enters a trance while painting as he connects with memories of his son: the motor-bike they built together in the family garage, for instance, and endless games of basketball. As he works, he listens with his son's headphones to the music they used to enjoy together, often the Ramones or Guns N' Roses. Manuel says the murals are more than a way to drain his anger and sorrow. ""What the hell does it matter how I feel? This isn't about me, this is about my kid,"" he said in an interview in Florida, a few days after he painted the Los Angeles mural. Story continues ""Joaquin's picture is a protest. Joaquin is a martyr, killed by a murderer who was endorsed by system that allows these things to happen."" ""A ROAD MAP"" Manuel and Patricia now dedicate their time to an organization that seeks to empower youth leaders called Change The Ref (CTR), a name inspired by a conversation with Joaquin about the referee of one of his basketball games. The group aims to use art and ""nonviolent creative confrontation"" to keep people talking about the victims and pressuring lawmakers to pass stricter gun regulations. ""You took something horrific, and instead of letting it stop you, you started a movement,"" the comedian Jimmy Fallon told students and victims' families in the commencement address at the June 3 graduation ceremony. Carlos Rodriguez, a 17-year-old Stoneman Douglas student who witnessed the shooting, launched a social media project called Stories Untold to collate footage of the incident. It has evolved into a broader effort to encourage victims of gun violence around the country to share their stories. He says the reaction to Parkland was notably different from previous mass shootings, in part because it affected a group of teenagers well-versed in using social media. The Parkland attack ""affected high-school kids, millennials, Generation Z-ers - we practically have a road map of what we need to do."" He was infuriated by the May 18 shooting at Santa Fe High School outside Houston, Texas that killed 10. ""It was like we were reliving what happened at our school. I wanted to be there with those students."" Parkland, a once quiet Florida suburb, is now filled with memorials and posters alongside its streets, parks and shops, demanding stricter gun control. Almost 70 percent of American adults support strong or moderate restrictions for firearms, a Reuters/Ipsos poll in May found. President Donald Trump has vowed not to tighten firearms laws despite multiple mass shootings this year and instead called for arming teachers and increasing school security. Daniela Menescal, 17, was hit by shrapnel during the Parkland attack and saw several classmates killed. Now recovered from her injuries, she puts her energy into spending time with family and focuses on studying piano and playing tennis to avoid thinking about that day. ""We've become a more united community after everything that happened,"" said Menescal. ""With the leadership of my classmates, we can raise our voices so that people understand that these changes need to happen.""

Jeffrey Zeigler was sentenced to two to 10 years for one count of assault with intent to do great bodily harm in addition to two years for one count of possession of a firearm in commission of a felony, NBC News reported. The charges stem from an incident that took place in April. In surveillance footage of the incident, 14-year-old Brennan Walker is seen stopping at Zeigler's home in Rochester Hills, on the outskirts of Detroit, to ask for directions after he missed his bus. Walker told a local NBC News affiliate in April that after he knocked on Ziegler’s door, a “lady came downstairs yelling at me.” ""She asked me, 'Why are you trying to break into my house?' and I told her I was just looking for directions to Rochester High,” he said.

Audrey Larson is a 14-year-old inventor. For past competitions, she's created glow-in-the-dark pajamas and a device to pet your dog. But this year, after hearing about the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, she felt compelled to focus on a more serious issue. ""It's really scary to just think about, and that's kind of what sparked that idea,"" Larson said. ""Some of my friends were having anxiety about being at school and I don't think that's fair to any kid."" Larson was looking for an idea to enter into competition, and discussions around school shootings among her peers led her to what she says is her own solution to the problem. She invented a foldable bulletproof wall model that can be used to protect students like her in the event of a school shooting. ""It's a foldable two-panel barrier that comes out of the wall for kids to hide behind in the event of a lockdown and, ultimately, in the event of a school shooting,"" Larson told ""GMA"" about her invention called Safe K.I.D.S. The name stands for Kevlar-cellulose-nanocrystal-AR500-steel Instant Defense System. Audrey Larson, 14, is pictured on July 31, 2018, with her invention idea on how to keep schools safe during a school shooting. ABC News Some of my friends were having anxiety about being at school Larson, who lives in Connecticut, first submitted her idea to the Connecticut Invention Convention, a program for young students to build projects centered on innovation. She won awards there before moving on to the National Invention Convention and Entrepreneurship Expo (NICEE) in Michigan. There Larson competed against other young inventors from all over the country, winning more awards and placing second in her grade level. She is currently working on securing a patent. ""It's very relevant, it really addresses the fears that are in school children today,"" said Mary Lombardo, a judge at the Connecticut Invention Convention and the vice president of engineering and innovation and research at United Technologies Corporation. Lombardo is of two minds when it comes down to the issue. ""As a mom I was saddened that these are the things that are on the mind of a freshman girl in high school,"" Lombardo said. ""I think as an engineer, I was fascinated with the robustness and detailed design work,"" she continued. Safe K.I.D.S. is a project from an invention competition that illustrates a potential solution to school shootings. ABC News The kids of my generation are already talking about this and getting fed up with it Larson chose the mix of materials that could make the wall including Kevlar to help it withstand shots from guns, even an AR-15 rifle. The accused Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooter in Parkland, Florida, allegedly used an AR-15 in the Valentine's Day massacre where 17 students and teachers were killed. ""From an engineering perspective I felt that it was very well thought-out,"" Lombardo said. ""It was doable and really gave a very simplistic solution to a very difficult and complex social problem."" Larson's invention is in line with other bullet-resistant products, including backpacks and clothing that have been marketed to schools and parents in the wake of mass shootings. Questions have been raised about the efficacy of some of these products and more broadly, debates about the best way to keep kids safe. Larson declined to weigh in on the gun reform debate, but said she considers her invention to be a ""non-political solution"" to the highly-politicized issue.

But it ""makes it maybe easier to implement in comparison to some of the other solutions as the gun control debate has been going on since Columbine."" ""Her solution solves a couple of very interesting problems in modern classrooms today,"" said Adam Coughran, who used to work in law enforcement and is president of Safe Kids Inc., a group that provides safety training sessions for educators. Coughran said many classrooms have a lot of windows to let in natural light, and glass isn't bulletproof. A display showcasing a bulletproof wall that 14-year-old Audrey Larson created for an invention competition. ABC News Although Coughran called her project ""extremely innovative,"" he pointed out a few things that could hamper the wall in reality. Desks and space issues could get in the way of moving the wall quickly. The wall might also not be large enough to protect everyone in an emergency, especially if other people are running into the room from outside. ""Her design and concept can easily be taken and spun off into other designs, such as those panels being slid together like a barn door or sliding glass door to cover an entire wall of windows,"" Coughran said. Growing up in light of massacres like Parkland and Sandy Hook, Larson believes that her generation will be at the forefront of innovating in this space. ""I think that my generation is going to be the change,"" Larson said.

The company said the new season will take Thomas and friends to different locations around the globe, like China, India and Australia, along with a new cast to bring gender equality and international characters onto the show. During the segment on her own show, Loesch took aim at the children’s television show about trains and the new international characters. “One of those trains, Nia, will be from Kenya to add ethnic diversity to the show.

A superior court judge signed an extreme risk protection order Thursday saying Jack Sawyer, 18, poses an extreme risk of physical harm to himself and others. Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he changed his stance on gun restrictions after reading the police affidavit in the Sawyer case. He signed bills Wednesday that raise the age to buy firearms, ban high-capacity magazines and make it easier to take guns from people who pose a threat. Within 24 hours, the NRA released a video attacking the governor, saying he ""gave a one finger salute to the Constitution and to gun owners,"" reported CBS affiliate WCAX. Prosecutors say Sawyer, who kept a diary called ""Journal of an Active Shooter,"" made detailed plans for a shooting at Fair Haven Union High School in which his goal was to kill more people than in any other school shooting. Republican Gov. Phil Scott said he changed his stance on gun restrictions after reading the affidavit in the Sawyer case. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox Now some residents are on edge and a school is boosting security after the state Supreme Court ruled that Sawyer should be granted bail. The court ruled Wednesday that Sawyer did not act on his plan and prosecutors did not have enough evidence to justify holding him without bail. He has pleaded not guilty to attempted aggravated murder and other charges and is being held without bail. No bail hearing has been scheduled. ""People are frustrated, they are nervous, they're scared,"" said Fair Haven cafe owner Mark Gutel said. ""Because that's a serious crime, it was a serious threat - a credible threat."" Following the court decision, School Superintendent Brooke Olsen-Farrell sent a note to parents saying additional safety measures are being implemented and will be completed by May 1. They include a swipe-card access system, increased police presence and perimeter checks, the Rutland Herald reported. Former federal prosecutor Jerry O'Neill told WCAX-TV that Vermont does not have a law differentiating an ""attempt"" versus a ""plan."" ""There definitely is a loophole, no question,"" he said. For that reason, Sawyer will likely be released on bail for lack of evidence in the attempted murder charge, he said. A court hearing is scheduled for April 27.

696,696,10610,http://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/390501-gun-violence-is-a-disease-has-dc-found-a-solution,Gun violence is a disease — has DC found a cure?,"In the wake of several high-profile police shootings, and as the momentum of the youth-led gun control movement continues to carry forward, the American public is taking a renewed interest in solutions to the wicked problems of public safety, gun violence, and police accountability. It’s become increasingly clear that we must work to address these problems in a way that acknowledges links between violence, racism, and public safety. As my colleague and Institute for Policy Studies Associate Fellow Ebony Slaughter-Johnson noted earlier this spring, American police killed more people last year than mass shooters. Where can we find holistic solutions? ADVERTISEMENT In the run-up to the March for Our Lives this March, the students of Stoneman Douglas High School proposed a gun control policy manifesto published in The Guardian. While it’s impressive in its scope, especially as the product of a group of young people, critics have made clear that some of the students’ suggested solutions would violate the privacy of the mentally ill and result in more aggressive policing. More aggressive policing tactics can’t be the answer, of course: We know that they disproportionately harm communities of color and ultimately lead to more violence. “The status quo of policing and mass incarceration have failed,” says Eugene Puryear of Stop Police Terror Project DC. “Study after study has shown us that mass incarceration and policing do not significantly reduce violence or other crime while carrying significant financial and social costs — that’s why a different approach is so important.” Treating gun violence as a public health crisis is the leading edge of this new approach, and one that is gaining traction across the country, including in the nation’s capital. It could ultimately reduce America’s incarceration rate through rethinking our approach to crime prevention. The Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results (NEAR) Act, a law passed by the D.C. Council in 2016 modeled on this approach, seeks to identify and address the root causes of crime while moving away from the failed status quo of policing and punishment that lead to increased arrests and incarceration — as well as the harassment and targeting of communities of color — while doing nothing to keep people safe. ADVERTISEMENT Yet despite passing the D.C. Council unanimously in 2016, the NEAR Act is still awaiting full implementation by Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration. There are three community-driven prongs to violence prevention in the NEAR Act: First, the law requires Community Crime Prevention Teams of behavioral health professionals to work in communities to identify people with signs of mental illness or substance abuse and connect them with existing services outside of the criminal legal system. Second, the law requires a newly-established Office of Violence Prevention and Health Equity to prevent the viral spread of violence by bringing therapy and social service coordination directly to victims of interpersonal violence while they’re still in hospitals. Third, a newly-established Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement is tasked with identifying and directly engaging with individuals at high risk of committing or falling victim to violence — and then providing individualized, wrap-around services to equip those individuals with the treatment, training, and support necessary to allow those at risk move towards a safer life. Alongside these components, the NEAR Act includes several elements to increase police accountability and recalibrate the strained relationship between neighborhood police and highly-policed communities. From expanding data collection and reporting requirements to prescribing training on bias and cultural competencies, it’s a clear mandate for police to work to repair their ways of relating with areas that have suffered from harassment and police violence for years. Here’s the best part: This broad, community-led approach has been a success across America already. In Richmond, Calif., where this approach was pioneered, gun violence was reduced by over 70 percent in just three years. New York City piloted a similar model in five neighborhoods, and the success led to its expansion into nearly 20 neighborhoods. After that expansion, the city saw its lowest level of gun violence in three decades. Other rigorous studies have proven that hospital-based violence intervention programs like the one in the NEAR Act succeed at reducing gun violence. This model is a replicable way to reduce gun violence. It deserves to be taken seriously. So what’s the hold up in the District? With this community-based approach already bearing such fruit nationwide, and holding such watershed potential for a different approach to public safety, why is the nation’s capital holding back at implementing the NEAR Act? “Since the NEAR Act became law, Mayor Bowser has consistently refused to fully or faithfully implement its life-saving approaches,” says April Goggans of Black Lives Matter DC. “We’d like to see these policies implemented in substance, to really transform what’s happening in our communities and get the results we know are possible. Unfortunately, despite being law for over two years, we’re still waiting for the NEAR Act to be implemented in substance.” The movement to combat gun violence in America is reaching a high watermark. With luck, wisdom, and momentum, one outcome could be a new approach to public safety that reduces violence without increasing America’s incarceration rate, addresses root causes, and empowers individuals and communities to thrive.

Butler High School’s announcement that classes would proceed just hours after the deadly shooting on campus drew backlash, however, from students, parents and activists online. Clayton Wilcox, superintendent of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools, defended the decision at a press conference Monday afternoon. “I want to clarify that our decision to keep students on campus and in class was motivated by one goal, and that’s to keep our students safe until transportation could be arranged with their families,” Wilcox told reporters. He continued: “I want to ask each of you who are here to consider for just one moment what would have happened had we just let kids run off into the neighborhood. For parents who were worried about their children, what would they have said to us if they would have come to school and we couldn’t locate their children? I think their fear would have been magnified. ... The plan that we had in place when an active shooter was on the campus was effectuated and it was effective.” Butler High, which is located roughly 12 miles southeast of Charlotte, went into lockdown around 7 a.m. Monday after a male student fired a gun at another male student during a disagreement in a crowded hallway, officials said. The victim, identified as 16-year-old sophomore Bobby McKeithen, was transported to a hospital, where he later died of his injuries, officials said. The suspected shooter, 16-year-old freshman Jatwan Cuffie, was taken into custody and questioned by police. He has been charged with first-degree murder. Wilcox described the confrontation between the two students as “a bullying incident gone out of control.” BREAKING: Victim is 16 year old Bobby McKeithen.

An armed school resource officer was on duty at the time of the incident, but it’s unclear whether he engaged the shooter, Russ told HuffPost. The school, which does not have metal detectors, plans to review its safety protocols in the wake of the shooting, he said. “This is a tragic event,” Russ said. “It is an event that will require support from the entire community of students and family and staff. ... There will be a great deal of healing taking place in the coming days and weeks.” Counseling is available to students and staff members in the wake of the shooting, the school district tweeted. Butler High classes have been canceled for Tuesday and Wednesday, Wilcox said at the press conference. “We are going to give the teachers an opportunity to process what they’ve been through and we will give students an opportunity to stay home with family and loved ones and come to grips with what took place today,” he said.” The school district’s earlier announcement that classes would proceed on Monday had drawn strong reactions on Twitter. “This is nightmarish,” tweeted Cameron Kasky, a survivor of the deadly mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14. @wcnc When the principal announced that classes would resume were to stay at school after shooting, I was one of the hundreds of parents to say “Hell No” and march past barriers to get to the front door at Butler High School to demand our kids. #ButlerHighSchoolShooting pic.twitter.com/DtDoHCA7YY — Wendy Foster (@CommonSenseMom_) October 29, 2018 Gun violence is now so normalized that students are expected to remain at school and continue classes after a shooting.

All 15 of its targets are on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s “Red to Blue” list, districts with strong Democratic candidates with potential to defeat the incumbent Republican or keep their seats in a contentious race. Everytown’s campaign, called Not One More, will run video ads and web page ads using imagery from shooting scenes to speak to “youth, communities of color and women voters,” people who might not have voted in past elections, Tuesday’s press release said. Everytown was founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has also put his full support behind Democrats in the 2018 midterms. The 15 targets include districts in California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington. Some of these districts have experienced mass shootings in the past, which may play a role in convincing voters to consider pro-gun control candidates more seriously. California’s 48th district, represented by Republican Dana Rohrabacher, was the site of the 2011 Seal Beach salon shooting, the deadliest mass shooting incident in Orange County history, with nine killed. Colorado’s 6th district, represented by Republican Mike Coffman, is home to the town of Aurora, where 12 people died and 70 were injured in the 2012 movie theater shooting. District 6 also experienced the 2010 Deer Creek middle school shooting, in which two people were injured, and the 2013 Arapahoe High School shooting, in which two people died, including the gunman. Everytown is also working to elect Democrat Lucy McBath in Georgia’s 6th congressional district, which is included in its target list. McBath is a gun-control activist whose son was shot and killed in Jacksonville, Florida. The nonprofit already invested more than $1.2 million to elect McBath in her primary and primary runoff. A week ago, Everytown pledged to spend up to $10 million in support of pro-gun-control gubernatorial candidates in Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and New Mexico.

It's the latest mass action since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that claimed seventeen lives and galvanized young people to act in the long-stalled debate over guns. Some activists are heartened by the attention being paid to the issue but they raise questions about how these students get viewed versus the treatment of their peers in the Black Lives Matter movement. I spoke to one of those activists, Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement. Cullors, a New York Times best selling author, also spoke about gender dynamics as it relates to violence and her connection with another activist, Richard Edmond Vargas, whose work in a California prison is the subject of a CNN documentary called The Feminist on Cellblock Y , now streaming on CNNgo. Our conversation, edited slightly for flow and length, is below: Emma Lacey-Bordeaux: What's missing from this current conversation we're having about the gun violence? Patrisse Cullors: It's been really incredible to witness. The interventions, the narrative interventions that have been made over the last couple of weeks. And the relationship to, which people get to become victims and which people get to become heroes. We've seen black folks be on the front line, fighting for better gun laws and yes, our issues have not been amplified, even though we have been disproportionately impacted by gun violence. While I'm so, so glad the Parkland students had the support that they deserve, we can't deny, uh, that the conversation on gun violence isn't incredibly racialized. Lacey-Bordeaux: How does that make you feel? Cullors: It's frustrating, and it's enraging, and it's clarifying, because it's important as organizers that we're able to articulate why racism permeates every single fight that we're in, especially when we're trying to fight for our lives. Lacey-Bordeaux: Then, given this renewed focus on gun violence, do you expect or hope that there could be a different level of interest or approach to hearing the voices of young people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement? Cullors: I think so. I've been pretty impressed with the Parkland students who've listened to young black students and brown students, mostly poor students who've been saying, you know, ""our issues matter, too."" And many of the Parkland students who've gone to Chicago and then met up with the black youth, to talk about gun violence. Um, one of the young men, was quoted saying, our issues, as in white people's issues, are being amplified over black people's issues, it's just a matter of race, and I thought that was so powerful, because they're listening to the young black and brown students who are saying, you know, we deserve to be a part of this larger media conversation, part of this larger public dialog and outcry to save the lives of young black and brown people too. So that has been so impressive. And I point that out because it's important for us to name our victories and I think that narrative shift has happened because black people have said, ""hey, wait a second, like, let's be a little bit more complicated about how we're talking about this gun violence issue,"" and the Parkland students have heard it and have been amplifying. Lacey-Bordeaux: We, Contessa Gayles and I, read your book with great interest and it was cool to read about Richard Edmond Vargas, the main character in our documentary, in your book -- in that chapter, specifically, you describe how the Black Lives Matter movement was founded, by the acquittal of George Zimmerman. So I wanted to ask you about that framing. Why frame both Richard's story and your part in co-founding the movement in relationship to each other? What's that connection? Cullors: Richie is very important because he becomes one of the first young people that I mentor when I'm a young person. I was 21 when I met him, he was 14 years old. And he quickly becomes like a little brother to me. And when he's convicted it was devastating for all of us. I made a commitment to stay in his life, and staying a part of his life. George Zimmerman killed somebody, literally, I mean, Richie didn't hurt anybody, maybe scared a few people but he didn't physically harm anybody, and I am visiting him, in a jail cell, in a locked-up facility, far away from his family and his loved ones. And, then George Zimmerman killed a young person, a young black boy, gets to go home free, and it just shows this juxtaposition of the banality of a quote ""criminal justice system,"" that has not been run to prioritize black people's health and wellness, and it's sort of amplified in that moment. Lacey-Bordeaux: How involved have you been with any of his anti-patriarchy efforts? Cullors: Oh, it's been amazing. I mean, he knows all about patriarchy, doesn't he? (laughs) You know, I remember talking to him when he first got into county jail and he used to get in a lot of fights at the county jail. Not, not because he wanted to and I remember talking to him on the phone, he called me, and he's like, ""alright I'm about to get in a fight right now,"" and I said, ""OK, listen to me, you get to choose what kind of person you wanna be inside, you could still be an organizer, they didn't take that away from you, you get to organize on the inside,"" and he said, ""OK."" He ended up going to Susanville, 11 hours away, the guards were exceptionally violent, and he was just trying to survive in there. And we were talking about like what does it look like (to) organize inside. Richard's not someone who is quick to be quiet, because he's just like already having conversations about patriarchy and, you know, and, by the time it got so bad is when I think his greatest ideas took root. And, he set up this platform to amplify these conversations about patriarchy and its toxicity and its impact on men and boys, and I was just, it was brilliant, and he's brilliant, and, so impactful, and everything he touches turns to gold, you know, everything he explores and every conversation he has, he feels a sincerity, nothing is inauthentic about Richard Edmond. Lacey-Bordeaux: Somewhat in line with that, how do you see patriarchy as playing a role in Richard ending up in prison? Cullors: I think Richard has a lot of different choices to make and I think the peer pressure of patriarchy won. When he told me why he robbed, he was trying to pay rent and he, you know, he wasn't getting the hours he needed at the preschool. I asked him, ""why didn't you just ask me for money, like, you've lived- you've lived with me before, you've asked me for money, like why didn't you ask me for rent money?"" And he said ""I was ashamed. You know, I was told that like I need to be providing, that, you know, taking money from women ...,"" and so this idea of like who he had to be and what he had to do to get what he needed is chock-full of patriarchy. And that really shaped his decisions and his, you know, decision that was then landing him in prison for all these years. And, you know, I don't know, I think it's interesting, like, I'd love to ask him, like if he would change it, and if he would change what he did, um, I don't know what he would - you know I don't know what his life would be like, I'm not a person who's like ""go to prison and change!"" I'm actually not that person at all, but one thing he's been able to do on the inside for everybody else and for himself is remarkable. Granted we'll see what happens, you know, what life on the outside's gonna be like for him, he's incredibly resilient. He'll be fine, but, the impact of incarceration is a lifelong impact. Lacey-Bordeaux: What's the connection between patriarchy and violence? Cullors: We're seeing it now, like with mass shootings, exclusively by white men (Note: The vast majority of shootings are by men, but the interview was conducted before a shooting by a woman at YouTube headquarters), we're seeing it with the Boston Bomber, we see it with law enforcement, and the police that use violence as a form of control and power. Lacey-Bordeaux: What's the solution? Cullors: Organizing. Organizing, prioritizing the conversations and the dialog that help us undo patriarchy and developing new practices, and, the fact that Richard has his entire group, that is their stage and a group that is talking about patriarchy and its negative impacts on the men who are in that group that they can feel powerful and it's so necessary.

Schools in District 308, like Oswego East, are determining new ways of screening people entering district buildings, after a former student was accused of entering Oswego High School with a plastic airsoft gun. (Chicago Tribune) Linda Girardi The Beacon-News Privacy Policy School District 308 is looking at new ways to screen people entering its buildings after a 17-year-old former student is accused of entering Oswego High School last week with a replica weapon. The teen has been charged with unauthorized possession of a weapon, a Class A misdemeanor, according to Oswego police. Police said the teen entered the school building Aug. 23 under false pretenses and had in his possession a plastic replica airsoft gun. School officials were informed that the replica weapon was not a threat to the safety of the students, according to a District 308 press release. They said the item was found in a student's backpack in a locker. 'The training and procedures in place should keep non-students from entering the building without an escort,' said District 308 Director of Communications Theresa Komitas. 'In this case the individual misrepresented themselves, and should not have entered the building alone. District protocols and procedures are being reviewed and retrained with staff. 'The school's response to the report of a possible weapon in the building was quick, and students and staff began responding as they've been trained to,' she said. She said a student is the one who reported seeing a possible weapon. 'We train everyone that if you see something, say something, and in this case the student did just that,' Komitas said. Due to the incident, the school was placed on a brief lockdown the morning of Aug. 23, not long after students arrived at school. Komitas said teachers and staff followed through with their security training as well. 'Once a possible threat was identified, the school went into lockdown,' she said. Komitas said the lockdown was lifted after seven minutes and students resumed with the regular daily schedule. 'We are in the process of researching additional ways to screen individuals entering the building during arrival,' she said. 'Once classes begin all entrances are locked and visitors and late arrivals much enter through the main entrance and are screened by a staff member.' Komitas said school administrators and building officials meet regularly with law enforcement to discuss security in the district’s schools. 'After this incident, we had a series of detailed debriefing meetings that included law enforcement officers to review exactly what happened and things that could be improved,' she said. 'The officers were complimentary of the response from the students and staff at the school, quickly initiating lockdown and responding as they have been trained to.' She said the district is 'taking the situation very seriously and working with local police, school and district administration to ensure the safety of our students and staff.' Oswego Police Chief Jeff Burgner said his department collaborates with the district on security matters. He said his staff met with district officials immediately after the recent incident.

Bezos, owns the The Washington Post) have acknowledged a petition and viral demands to take NRA videos offline. If they do, and the world’s largest tech corporations effectively declare the NRA a pariah, boycotters have proposed plans to advance on the gun rights group’s power centers: its political capital and massive funding, which for decades have made the NRA one of the most feared lobbies in the United States. AD AD Or the boycott could end here and, ultimately, fail to change U.S. gun laws or culture, as other anti-NRA campaigns have failed before. The Sandy Hook Prologue The campaign went viral after the Feb. 14 massacre of 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle in Parkland, Fla. But the campaign has a prequel: a similar movement launched six years ago, when 20 children and six adults were gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Conn. Gun-control advocates failed to hobble the NRA in 2012, which resisted calls for tighter gun laws then, as it does after all mass shootings. Nor was there anything like the string of corporate boycotts we see today. But as The Washington Post wrote at the time, the Newtown shooting accelerated Democratic politicians’ desertion of the NRA. The organization, which often says it is simply protecting the constitutional right of Americans to bear arms, used to enjoy bipartisan political support. “I worry the NRA has become a captive of the Republican Party.” Rep. Gene Green, a Texas Democrat who supported the NRA, told The Post in 2012. “In the long run, it will be weakened.” AD AD After the Sandy Hook campaign, as CNN noted, the NRA’s contributions to Democratic politicians dropped to almost nothing. By 2017, the NRA was producing apocalyptic videos that had almost nothing to do with guns and instead accused Democrats and reporters of tilting the United States into “organized anarchy.” The Marjory Stoneman Douglas Campaign While the #BoycottNRA hashtag has floated around social media for years, the movement exploded after a former student who owned at least 10 guns was accused of shooting up the Parkland high school this month. One of the first tweets to go semi-viral was posted by a self-described retired principal. A few days later, a combination of gun-control activists, teenage shooting survivors and liberal groups had turned the hashtag into a full-blown pressure campaign. Any corporation with even a tangential affiliation to the NRA was called out, with lists circulating across Twitter. AD AD First National Bank of Omaha, one of the largest private banks in the United States, may have been the first to bow to the calls for boycott. The bank announced Thursday, a week after the shooting, that it would discontinue its “NRA Visa Card,” which had given the orgnization’s members 5 percent back on gas and sporting-goods purchases. The rental car giant Enterprise followed suit a few hours later. “All three of our brands have ended the discount for NRA members,” effective March 26, the car rental company wrote Thursday afternoon on Twitter. Hertz, Avis Budget Group and TrueCar would soon join Enterprise, as would North American Van Lines and Allied Van Lines. The companies faced a backlash from gun rights supporters, but only a few corporations on the boycott list resisted. By the end of Friday, Symantec had announced that NRA members would have to pay the same price for its anti-virus software as everyone else. Chubb Limited insurance announced the end of a policy for NRA members who faced lawsuits for shooting people — Chubb called the program “NRA Carry Guard,” while critics had labeled it “murder insurance.” The global insurance company MetLife ended its NRA member discount. Best Western and Wyndham Hotels announced that they were no longer affiliated with the group. AD AD Delta Air Lines held out against the pressure — for a few hours. A spokesman at first defended Delta’s flight discounts to the NRA’s annual convention in Dallas in May as “routine” for large groups. The airline “has more than 2,000 such contracts in place,” a spokesman told the liberal outlet ThinkProgress on Friday night. Come Saturday morning, Delta abruptly discontinued the discounts and asked the NRA to remove the information about the perk from the convention website. United Airlines released a nearly identical statement two hours later. Some companies have held out. FedEx, for example, still gives NRA Business Alliance members up to a 26 percent discount on shipping expenses. AD Still, by the end of Saturday, more than a dozen of the country’s larger corporations — representing the travel, software, insurance, banking and hospitality industries — had all abandoned the NRA. AD Nothing like that had happened after the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012, or any other gun massacre in modern U.S. history. The next battles In a statement released Saturday afternoon, the NRA accused the corporations that dropped their discounts of “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice,” but also dismissed the significance of their snubs. “Let it be absolutely clear,” the NRA’s statement said. “The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.” AD But #BoycottNRA is not yet satisfied. By Saturday, the boycott push was focused on tech giants that stream NRA-produced videos — namely Amazon, Apple, Google and Roku. NRATV, a 24-hour streaming channel, is sometimes accused of being the group’s propaganda arm. After the Florida shooting, the New York Times wrote, “its hosts spoke chillingly of leftist plots to confiscate weapons, media conspiracies to brainwash Americans into supporting gun control and a ‘deep state’ campaign to undermine President Trump.” AD Subsequently, an online petition demanding that Amazon drop NRATV had amassed more than 100,000 signatures by early Sunday morning, with more added each second. AD Some have also called for boycotts of any affiliated companies, including The Post. Bezos, who owns The Post, also owns Amazon. Amazon, Apple and Google have not responded to questions from The Post about the calls to drop NRATV or publicly acknowledged the campaign by early Sunday. But the NRA, which dismissed other boycott actions as trivial, released a dire video message (on NRATV), equating calls to shut it down with an attack on free speech. NRA leaders also spoke defiantly at public appearances last week, blaming the fury against their organization on media manipulation. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch said Thursday at a conservative political conference. “Crying white mothers are ratings gold.” AD AD “They want to make us all less free,” NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre said when he took the microphone. The correct response to the Florida shooting, he said, was more armed security on school campuses — not fewer guns in the United States. Wars to come? Pressure campaigns have become a favorite tool of liberal groups during Trump’s presidency — from early efforts to boycott Trump-branded products to a Twitter campaign that identified and exposed people seen marching at a far-right rally in Charlottesville this past summer. Social media and Internet companies began to ban far-right personalities from their sites after that rally turned violent. For all the companies that have signed on to the latest NRA boycotts, they have managed only to wipe out a few peripheral perks for the group’s members. The group claims 5 million members and tens of millions in annual revenue. According to Business Insider, it is funded largely by the gun industry, and it has converted much of that money into alliances and power networks across the U.S. political system. AD How far the boycott movement will spread is unknown. But if it keeps up at the pace of the past three days, there are signs it could threaten the political and financial cornerstones of the gun lobby. After the Florida shooting, a prominent City Council member in Dallas said the city no longer wants the NRA to hold its convention there in May — even though Fox News reported that officials in Kansas and Nebraska have invited the gun group’s business. Florida Gov. Rick Scott and other Republicans have endorsed banning rifle sales to anyone younger than 21, which the NRA opposes. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) vowed at a town hall forum last week to keep accepting political contributions from the gun rights group — and was met with a loud round of boos. Even Trump has said that he expects the NRA to soon back new gun-control measures, according to Bloomberg News. NRA opponents would love to hobble the group’s revenue sources — not to mention the gun industry, which manufactures many of the hundreds of millions of guns in the country. Although a long shot, the feat may not be as impossible as it once seemed. The gun industry is supported in part by widely held public stocks. CNBC reported this week that some of Wall Street’s largest exchange-traded funds include gunmakers in their portfolios. But since the Florida shooting, the investment giant BlackRock has been exploring ways of letting its clients disinvest from gun companies, Bloomberg News reported. And teachers in Florida are pressuring their pension fund managers to do the same. Five days after the Stoneman Douglas shooting, financial writer Andrew Ross Sorkin made a proposal in the New York Times: Banks and credit companies could effectively stifle the sale of assault weapons — simply by prohibiting customers from using their cards and services to buy these weapons. Credit card companies already ban the purchase of cryptocurrency and other products, Sorkin wrote. If Visa and MasterCard banned assault-style weapons, like the AR-15 used in Florida, “assault weapons would be eliminated from virtually every firearms store in America because otherwise the sellers would be cut off from the credit card systems.” Some have also suggested that banks could throttle gun makers from the supply side, by cutting off credit. In the past, that proposal has been a nonstarter. In 2012, Snopes investigated a report that Bank of America was cutting off credit lines to gun manufacturers. A spokeswoman for the bank denied the report, saying it had no policies against doing business with the firearms industry and pointing to a $250 million deal with a gunmaker that month. Six years later, amid the growing outrage over the Stoneman Douglas massacre, the bank’s rhetoric sounds a bit different. Axios reported Saturday that Bank of America was “reexamining” its relationship with AR-15 rifle manufacturers that do business with it. “We are joining other companies in our industry to examine what we can do to help end the tragedy of mass shootings,” the bank said in a statement.

""We you, Pittsburgh. # PittsburghStrong,"" Moore tweeted, while Watson urged her followers to inform themselves on the issue of gun violence. 💗 From the very start, This Is Us has established its foothold in Pittsburgh culture, with the Pearson family enthusiastically rooting for the Pittsburgh Steelers and storylines revolving around the Steelers' Super Bowl appearances.

Last April, Moore and co-star Milo Ventimiglia traveled to Pittsburgh's Heinz Field to participate in the NFL draft, where they announced one of the Steelers' draft picks.

While federal law sets an age limit of 21 for all handgun purchases from federally licensed dealers, the federal age limit for purchases of long guns is 18. AD AD That age difference has become a flash point in gun policy debates following the Parkland shooting. Florida's law makes it one of just three states, including Illinois and Hawaii, that set an age limit of 21 for rifle purchases. The NRA maintains that Florida's age limit violates the constitutional rights of young adults, alleging that it prohibits ""an entire class of law-abiding, responsible citizens from fully exercising the right to keep and bear arms—namely, adults who have reached the age of 18 but are not yet 21."" The group further notes that ""at 18 years of age, law-abiding citizens in this country are considered adults for almost all purposes and certainly for the purposes of the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights. At 18, citizens are eligible to serve in the military—to fight and die by arms for the country."" AD AD The issues at stake are similar to those raised in a previous federal lawsuit the NRA brought alleging the federal prohibition on handgun purchases by individuals under the age of 21 is ""a categorical burden on the fundamental right [of young adults] to keep and bear arms."" But the federal courts did not see it that way. In 2013, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in that case that age restrictions on handgun purchases were ""consistent with a longstanding tradition of targeting select groups’ ability to access and to use arms for the sake of public safety."" When Congress set the age limit for handgun purchases as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, it did so because it reasoned that young adults between the ages of 18 and 20 ""tend to be relatively immature and that denying them easy access to handguns would deter violent crime,"" the court found. AD AD The NRA appealed that ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. But the court declined to review the case, letting the appeals court's ruling stand. It also declined to review a lower court's decision that let stand a Texas law prohibiting 18- to 20-year-olds from carrying guns in public. At the time those denials were issued, longtime Supreme Court observer Lyle Denniston noted that ""the Court is not, as yet, ready to stop lower courts from creating an entirely new group in society with less than full gun rights. In those cases, it was youths aged eighteen to twenty years old."" AD AD The Supreme Court ruled in 2008 that the Second Amendment ""guarantee[s] the individual right to possess and carry"" firearms. But since then, the Supreme Court has generally let lower courts determine what types of restrictions on gun ownership remain permissible under that interpretation.",Gun Gun control Rifle Firearm Handgun AR-15 style rifle Semi-automatic rifle Shooting Gun ownership Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence,"A rifle used by the Parkland, Fla., shooting site in Parkland, Fla., on Wednesday.","The Parkland shooter legally purchased the military-style rifle used in the attack from a federally licensed gun dealer when he was 18.

How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present Robert MacPherson/AFP/Getty Images A would-be assassin out to kill a U.S. president builds a gun out of composite materials and hides bullets in his metal, rabbit’s foot keychain as he glides through a metal detector. He then reassembles the pieces and reconstructs the gun while sitting at a table at a political fundraiser. He approaches the president and pulls the trigger. Only Clint Eastwood leaping in front of the bullet saves the fictitious president. The crowning moment in the 1993 hit film ""In the Line of Fire"" involved the John Malkovich’s villain putting together an untraceable gun, and now, lawmakers are trying to make that more difficult for others to do. The current concern stems from a legal battle over guns that can be made using 3-D printers. ""Building guns out of materials that are undetectable by security screening devices is not necessarily a new concept, but in the past it required someone with specific skills who knew how to do it,"" said John Cohen, a former police officer and Homeland Security official who is currently an ABC News contributor. ""By putting these instructions on the internet you are dramatically expanding the number of people who could build these types of guns."" The 3-D printed guns are in the spotlight now because the U.S. State Department settled a multi-year court battle with a Texas-based company that was pushing to put downloadable instructions to build guns from 3-D printed pieces online. A federal judge intervened with a restraining order. How the guns are made The weapons at the center of the legal firestorm are ones that are printed out in parts and then constructed by the user. Specialized printers are able to print out three-dimensional objects built out of plastic or resin. By following instructions that have the specifications for a gun, the user can then print the various pieces and put those together like a 3-D puzzle. But for a ""functional firearm,"" Cohen said. ""All it takes is for them to get the ammunition that you buy for any regular firearm and then start using it as a weapon,"" he said. Much like guns themselves, the costs of 3-D printers range dramatically from hundreds to thousands of dollars. Safety concerns The fact that these guns are printed at home and not by a licensed manufacturer who needs to keep records means that the weapons are untraceable in paper trails. Beyond that, they are also undetectable by metal detectors, including those used at airports and at federal buildings. The shifting aesthetic of 3-D guns, which are not necessarily black and could theoretically be any color, poses significant problems for law enforcement, Cohen said, noting that it might take longer for police to identify such a gun as a deadly weapon in a confrontational situation where every second counts. ""Depending on the appearance it could cause confusion when a police officer is trying to determine if someone is a deadly threat or not,"" he said. The background checks required in many situations where people buy guns on the open market would not apply to those buying 3-D printers, which can be used for making numerous objects besides guns. ""As a cop you're going to be concerned that people who would typically have a difficult time obtaining a gun might be able to manufacture a gun that they can use to commit crimes,"" Cohen said.",3D printed firearms Gun Firearm Ghost gun Defense Distributed 3D printing United States Weapon Gun safety Gun control,A 3-D printed gun made by a company that is trying to put the weapons out of parts on the Internet.,How 3-D printed guns are made and the growing security concerns they present The weapons have been subject to a lengthy legal case.

He added that he would allocate federal funding to training said educators. “I want my schools protected just like I want my banks protected,” the president said. Trump first floated the armed-teachers idea — which is backed by the National Rifle Association — on Wednesday during an emotional listening session with survivors and parents of the Florida shooting as well as other students, teacher and families affected by gun violence in schools. Trump has also voiced support for raising the minimum age for buying certain guns from 18 to 21, and enhanced background checks for people purchasing firearms — but said Thursday that he disapproved of schools holding active shooter drills to prepare students and staff for the worst. “Active shooter drills is a very negative thing,” Trump said after Pam Stewart, the Florida Department of Education commissioner, brought up the drills. “I don’t like it. I’d much rather have a hardened school.” Trump added that active shooter drills were “crazy,” and “very hard on children.” Trump also tweeted this morning that he wants to give “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience,” which he estimated is 20 percent of teachers. I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC.

A video of a tense encounter between four black students and a white man in Florida has prompted a police investigation after it went viral on . The video, posted by one of the students of Florida A&M University, Isiah Butterfield, shows the man holding a gun and using his body to prevent the students from entering the building of a student housing complex on Saturday. The video has been viewed more than 320,000 times on Twitter. ""...We are sick of the discrimination,"" said Butterfield in the tweet. ""Never thought I’d have a personal experience with racism like this..."" The incident is under investigation under Florida's statute of aggravated assault with deadly weapon without intent to kill, the Tallahassee Police Department said. Four black students in Florida were blocked from entering the elevator of a student housing complex by a white man holding a gun on Saturday, Sept. 8, 2018. WTXL ""Once we found out he had the gun, it turned into a whole different situation,"" Butterfield told ABC News. ""We really think he was trying to provoke us to the point where it got violent so he could retaliate with the gun. I knew that if this dude even feels threatened, he's going to find any excuse to pull the trigger."" ABC News reached out to the man in the video, Don Crandall, for comment and will update the story if he responds. Butterfield said the encounter with Crandall started when the four students were waiting outside the apartment complex for their friend to let them in to join a party. Crandall told them they weren't getting into the building, went inside and locked the door. ""We were just sitting there confused, like why did he even say anything to us?"" Butterfield said. Then Crandall came out, again, to reiterate the point and that's when Butterfield started recording the events on his phone. That was also when another white student, a resident of the building, tried to intervene on their behalf and let them in, urging Crandall to ""keep walking"" and ""just go about your day."" We really think he was trying to provoke us to the point where it got violent so he could retaliate with the gun In the video, Crandall, who appears to be considerably older than the young students and was confirmed to not be a resident of the building, trades insults with the white student as the black students stand watching quietly. Afterward, they all enter the building but Crandall refused to let them enter the elevator with him. ""Find another elevator, you can't get in this one,"" he said, blocking their way as the four students tried to enter it. ""Why not? Do you own the building?"" the students asked. ""Because you don't belong in this building,"" he replied, before adding, ""You ain't got a key for the building, you don't belong in the elevator."" The man took out a key to show them, which was when the students noticed he had a gun in his hand. ""Sir, you bring out your gun. What's your purpose for that?"" one of the students asked. ""Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. Forgive me,"" he said, trying to hide it behind him. The apartment complex, Stadium Centre, said the man did not live in the building and that firearms are not allowed inside. WTXL The white student sided with the black students throughout the ordeal. Butterfield acknowledged his support on Twitter for ""standing by us ... that’s a real dude right there."" The apartment complex, Stadium Centre, said the man did not live in the building.

More than a dozen companies have already severed their ties with the NRA, while multinational delivery services company FedEx announced that, despite having a different stance on gun policy, it would continue its partnership with the NRA. “FedEx opposes assault rifles being in the hands of civilians,” the statement reads. “The NRA is one of hundreds of organizations in our alliances/association Marketing program whose members receive discounted rates for FedEx shipping. FedEx has never set or changed rates for any of our millions of customers around the world in response to their politics, beliefs or positions on issues.” The company was forced to address the continuing controversy on Tuesday, however, with a follow-up statement that appeared to further distance the company from the gun rights group. “FedEx has never provided any donation or sponsorship to the NRA which is one of hundreds of alliance and association participants that serve more than one million customers.

Cameron Kasky, who along with classmates David Hogg and Emma Gonzalez became one of the faces of gun control in America, said he was ready to move on from the group, but that his mind had been opened to different political perspectives in the process. ""...I met that person in Texas who got that semiautomatic weapon because that's how they like to protect their family,"" Kasky said on Fox News Radio on Wednesday. ""I met the 50-some-odd percent of women who are pro-life, even though I thought it was preposterous that a woman could be pro-life and not pro-choice at the time. ""I learned that a lot of our issues politically come from a lack of understanding of other perspectives and also the fact that so often young conservatives and young liberals will go into debate...trying to beat one another as opposed to come to an agreement."" What's the big regret? One of Kasky's most visible moments as a member of March For Our Lives was the town hall event broadcast on CNN, which was advertised as a forum to open a dialogue about gun issues and predictably devolved into emotional outbursts, finger pointing and grandstanding. Kasky found himself face-to-face with Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, and he gave the audience a made-for-TV moment that was rebroadcast and retweeted for days to follow. ""Senator Rubio, it's hard to look at you and not look down the barrel of an AR-15 and not look at Nikolas Cruz, but the point is you're here and there are some people who are not,"" Kasky told Rubio during the town hall, before aggressively asking the senator if he would stop taking money from the National Rifle Association. Kasky admits emotion got the best of him in that moment. ""I look back on that and I say, you know what, there were people who had just been buried and when you're looking at somebody that you find might in some way have been complicit in this murderer obtaining the weapon it's hard not to say something like that,"" Kasky said. ""But, I went into that wanting less conversation and more to embarrass Rubio and that was my biggest flaw."" Kasky said his political views haven't changed, but he wants to use his platform now to help people have more civil and productive bipartisan discussions.

It’s become increasingly clear that we must work to address these problems in a way that acknowledges links between violence, racism, and public safety. As my colleague and Institute for Policy Studies Associate Fellow Ebony Slaughter-Johnson noted earlier this spring, American police killed more people last year than mass shooters. Where can we find holistic solutions? ADVERTISEMENT In the run-up to the March for Our Lives this March, the students of Stoneman Douglas High School proposed a gun control policy manifesto published in The Guardian. While it’s impressive in its scope, especially as the product of a group of young people, critics have made clear that some of the students’ suggested solutions would violate the privacy of the mentally ill and result in more aggressive policing. More aggressive policing tactics can’t be the answer, of course: We know that they disproportionately harm communities of color and ultimately lead to more violence. “The status quo of policing and mass incarceration have failed,” says Eugene Puryear of Stop Police Terror Project DC. “Study after study has shown us that mass incarceration and policing do not significantly reduce violence or other crime while carrying significant financial and social costs — that’s why a different approach is so important.” Treating gun violence as a public health crisis is the leading edge of this new approach, and one that is gaining traction across the country, including in the nation’s capital. It could ultimately reduce America’s incarceration rate through rethinking our approach to crime prevention. The Neighborhood Engagement Achieves Results (NEAR) Act, a law passed by the D.C. Council in 2016 modeled on this approach, seeks to identify and address the root causes of crime while moving away from the failed status quo of policing and punishment that lead to increased arrests and incarceration — as well as the harassment and targeting of communities of color — while doing nothing to keep people safe. ADVERTISEMENT Yet despite passing the D.C. Council unanimously in 2016, the NEAR Act is still awaiting full implementation by Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration. There are three community-driven prongs to violence prevention in the NEAR Act: First, the law requires Community Crime Prevention Teams of behavioral health professionals to work in communities to identify people with signs of mental illness or substance abuse and connect them with existing services outside of the criminal legal system. Second, the law requires a newly-established Office of Violence Prevention and Health Equity to prevent the viral spread of violence by bringing therapy and social service coordination directly to victims of interpersonal violence while they’re still in hospitals. Third, a newly-established Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement is tasked with identifying and directly engaging with individuals at high risk of committing or falling victim to violence — and then providing individualized, wrap-around services to equip those individuals with the treatment, training, and support necessary to allow those at risk move towards a safer life. Alongside these components, the NEAR Act includes several elements to increase police accountability and recalibrate the strained relationship between neighborhood police and highly-policed communities. From expanding data collection and reporting requirements to prescribing training on bias and cultural competencies, it’s a clear mandate for police to work to repair their ways of relating with areas that have suffered from harassment and police violence for years. Here’s the best part: This broad, community-led approach has been a success across America already. In Richmond, Calif., where this approach was pioneered, gun violence was reduced by over 70 percent in just three years. New York City piloted a similar model in five neighborhoods, and the success led to its expansion into nearly 20 neighborhoods. After that expansion, the city saw its lowest level of gun violence in three decades. Other rigorous studies have proven that hospital-based violence intervention programs like the one in the NEAR Act succeed at reducing gun violence. This model is a replicable way to reduce gun violence. It deserves to be taken seriously. So what’s the hold up in the District? With this community-based approach already bearing such fruit nationwide, and holding such watershed potential for a different approach to public safety, why is the nation’s capital holding back at implementing the NEAR Act? “Since the NEAR Act became law, Mayor Bowser has consistently refused to fully or faithfully implement its life-saving approaches,” says April Goggans of Black Lives Matter DC. “We’d like to see these policies implemented in substance, to really transform what’s happening in our communities and get the results we know are possible. Unfortunately, despite being law for over two years, we’re still waiting for the NEAR Act to be implemented in substance.” The movement to combat gun violence in America is reaching a high watermark. With luck, wisdom, and momentum, one outcome could be a new approach to public safety that reduces violence without increasing America’s incarceration rate, addresses root causes, and empowers individuals and communities to thrive.

According to Curtis, the use of firearms in the film align with her sensible views on gun control. “I am vocal about common-sense gun safety and gun laws,” Curtis said about her stance on the issue in an interview with USA Today. “For instance, I fully support an assault weapon ban, I fully support a bump stock ban.” Read More:‘Halloween’: Every Film in John Carpenter’s Iconic Franchise, Ranked Curtis was adamant that she is not entirely anti-gun. “I fully support the Bill of Rights. And fully support the Second Amendment,” she said. “And have absolutely no problem with people owning firearms if they have been trained, licensed, a background check has been conducted, a pause button has been pushed to give time for that process to take place. And they have to renew their license just like we do with automobiles – which are weapons also.” As executive producer of the new “Halloween,” Curtis had creative involvement in the film’s development, and one way she executed her control was to ensure the film handled the portrayal of guns in a sensible manner. “They knew that Laurie was going to be someone who used firearms,” Curtis said. “And I think there were myriad types of firearms that could have been used in the movie. I was very clear with the filmmakers that she used the weapons (that) were intended for self-defense for her and her family.” Curtis proved her point by pointing to a scene in which Laurie Strode arms her daughter and her granddaughter so they can protect themselves against Myers. The actress noted the guns in the film are locked behind a padlocked cabinet and not out in the open for anyone to use, and when Strode does give weapons to her family members she “specifically says what each weapon does and why you would choose that weapon in self-defense.” “Halloween” is now playing in theaters nationwide.

Across the street, a small group of parents and citizens stood in support of the students. """"They deserve a safe place, a better world,"""" said Teri Richard, of Hobart. The students said they're joining demonstrations on March 24 in Chicago and an April 20 commemoration of the 1999 Columbine High School mass shooting in Colorado. For schools, balancing security and speech Across Northwest Indiana schools, citing a need to balance protests while protecting students and keeping order, many school districts looked for a compromise. Several warned in parent letters that students could be subject to discipline if the school administrators felt they violated its code of conduct. Several, including Hammond, Lake Central, Valparaiso and Chesterton requested additional police to watch students allowed to stage walkouts to designated areas. Citing security fears, some districts including Crown Point, Highland and Valparaiso barred parents, citizens and media. Crown Point High School Principal Chip Pettit sent a letter home to parents stating the event would happen inside the school gym. Student Sokhna Kelly, 17, said she initially felt the school's involvement was censorship. Student organizers would livestream the event on Twitter and Instagram, she said. The original event was slated to have stations — including information on voter registration, sign making, and information on related legislation. On Wednesday, some Crown Point students ended up walking outside the building in protest, according to the video. With some wearing orange, students briefly shouted, """"We want change!"""" Organizers gave students the chance to speak briefly and told them to use a text code used to look up National Rifle Association donations to local politicians to ask them to send it back, she said. About 100 participated, Kelly said. She and other organizers later met with Pettit, she said. """"No one from the administration tried to block us from walking out, they simply supervised and listened,"""" she later said via email. At Valparaiso, students who left the building were given detention, according to school officials. """"They received a detention as indicated in our letter to parents that we would be following the student handbook,"""" acting Superintendent Julie Lauck said via email. """"The handbook indicates that when a student leaves the building without the permission of the administration it is a truancy."""" Instead of walkouts, Merrillville High School held schoolwide events including two videos and other student-led activities including discussing workshops that could bridge barriers between students. The school handed out a safety survey to students — continuing a schoolwide security panel it held for students on Tuesday. In a letter to parents, Highland High School Principal Patrick Weil acknowledged Wednesday's protests were significant, the school would not allow students to stage walkouts. """"To that end, students will have an opportunity to discuss these issues with their teachers on Wednesday morning. In addition, students will have the option to participate in three different activities in which our student body will collectively work together to send a symbol of hope and healing to the students and staff at Parkland High School in Florida and/or write their Congressman or State Representative to express their feelings about school safety,"""" he said. In Gary, students gathered outside Wednesday morning and held hands to mark the anniversary at the Steel City Academy, a charter school on 35th Avenue. More protests planned Kelly said she hoped Wednesday's walkout would have a lasting impact at Crown Point High School. Organizers including students Janiya Johnson, Sophia Espinoza, and Katya Halstead are raising money to pay for a bus taking students and adults to the March 24 March for Our Lives rally in Chicago, she said. They also hope to secure a small grant to start a social activism club, she said. On March 24, protests are planned in Highland in Main Square Park and Chicago on the same day as the national March for our Lives organized by Parkland students in Washington, D.C. Several students also plan to speak during a Youth Speak Rally scheduled at Unity Plaza in East Chicago on March 24. In Porter County, students from several schools including Chesterton, Portage, Crown Point and Valparaiso are in initial phases of planning an organized protest at the Porter County courthouse on April 20 — the anniversary of the 1999 Columbine High School shootings in Colorado. Valparaiso senior Ollie Gricich, 18, who has planned both her school's walkout and the April 20 protest, told the Post-Tribune last week it was important for students to be willing to risk punishment to protest. """"(We) very much decided we were going to be doing this whether administration was supportive or not,"""" she said. """"When you walk out, you give up something.

1194,1194,75,http://www.yahoo.com/news/day-mass-shooting-held-another-150257669.html,"The Day After Jacksonville's Mass Shooting, They Held Another Gaming Tournament","(Photo: Andy Campbell/HuffPost) JACKSONVILLE, Fla. ― On Monday night, a group of gamers met up at a local arcade and bar for a casual Super Smash Bros. tournament. It wasn’t anything fancy; a few guys and gals hooted and hollered over beers in the corner of the bar, duking it out in pairs of two, either in front of a tiny TV or a projector screen. Some were regulars, who’d been schlepping their controllers and consoles to this King Street venue since it was a laundromat and bar, well before last year, when it became a dedicated barcade called Keg & Coin. Others were just curious and asked to hop in for a quick round of Smash. It was like a lot of other Jacksonville gaming events: smaller affairs that happen almost nightly and usually take place at one of three mainstay arcades in town, or at a less formal locale like someone’s apartment, where this competitive gaming community got its roots. But of course, this night was different. Some of the folks watching the tournament wore shirts or pins bearing the name GLHF ― the arcade just over two miles away at Jacksonville Landing where, less than 24 hours prior, a mass shooting at a Madden tournament left three dead and another 11 wounded. Keg & Coin, then, was the obvious setting for them to gather and mourn together; to revel; to plot their next steps; to just get their mind off things. “We needed somewhere to get together and hang out ― now this is one of the only places to do that,” said Joshua “Tyger” Campbell, 35, who’s been hosting competitions in town for nearly two decades. “In Jacksonville, this scene used to be so underground. But in the past three to five years we’ve had so much community organizing and so many events that we’re stronger. We have so many places now where gamers feel safe to congregate.” They also wanted to point out the strength of this community. Campbell said he was excited that a national gaming tournament was being held at one of his local haunts. It signaled that the community he’d helped to start, with small Dance Dance Revolution tournaments held back in 2003, was thriving. Story continues But then came the shooting, one that would undoubtedly change the message about his community. This was, after all, a shooting at a video game tournament, and gaming has been a punching bag and a boogeyman for politicians since shooting at Columbine. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has continued that storied tradition, vowing earlier this year to look into the connection between video games and mass shootings. Surely, this real-world, violent event would breed more mischaracterizations about video game culture. “It’s just heartbreaking,” said Mark Ronan, 22, who organizes gaming events across the city. “GLHF is here so we can have a place to hold awesome events like the Madden tournament. One of Jacksonville’s opportunities to shine in the esports world was soiled, and made headlines for all the wrong reasons.” The people HuffPost spoke to Monday ― gaming advocates and activists, family and friends of those victims still hospitalized ― wanted to paint a different picture of local gaming. They’ve spent years fostering a culture of charity, entertainment and competition that extends well beyond the shooting at Jacksonville Landing. ’This Is His Dream’ Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo poses with Florida Gov. Rick Scott from his hospital bed in Jacksonville. (Photo: Courtesy of Sujeil Lopez) At the University of Florida Health medical center, Sujeil Lopez told reporters that she used to get upset when her son, 26-year-old Timothy “oLARRY” Anselimo, played video games for a dozen hours a day or more where he grew up in New York City. “I used to get mad,” she said. “My husband used to say, ‘He could be outside doing a lot worse, leave him alone!’ I used to be so furious. But he went to high school, went to college, and he’s a good man.” Anselimo now makes a living playing NBA 2K competitively and boasts a sponsorship from the Milwaukee Bucks. Lopez created a Twitter account just to follow and support his career. She’s fully on board. “This is his dream ― his life,” Lopez said, a life that was put on hold when her son was shot three times on Sunday, once in the chest, once in the hip and again in his right hand. Lopez spoke to reporters as he went through surgery on that hand, a procedure which would decide whether he could continue his career. “As a mother you want your child to be brave,” she said. “If he can’t play and he can’t work, his life would be changed forever. ... But look forward to seeing him again. This is not the last you’ll see of oLARRY, I promise you that!” In the same hospital where Lopez spoke, another group of friends and family was waiting on Chris “Dubby” McFarland to recover. The world-renowned Madden player was grazed in the head by a bullet on Sunday. His friend, John Washington, said outside the ER that McFarland’s gaming community, and sense of safety, had been “invaded.” “He’s very emotional, his whole family is emotional. He’s a soldier, but now it’s like, where in America can you go and feel safe anymore?” Washington said. “The gamers really appreciated this event coming to town. This was just so catastrophic for all of them and the Jacksonville community as a whole.” McFarland, he said, was expected to be released from the hospital sometime this week. But his side career in gaming may be put on hold. ‘Gaming’s Not Going Anywhere’ From left to right: Kyle Schmisek, Joshua Campbell and Mark Ronan, at Keg & Coin in Jacksonville. (Photo: Andy Campbell/HuffPost) There’s rehabilitation to be done, but luckily for the gamers in town, there’s already a network in place to do that. Before the shooting, they had Games Art And Music, a gaming culture company that melds local entertainment with events; the Jacksonville chapter of Extra Life, which raises money for local pediatric programs through gaming events; and locals like Campbell and Ronan, who are already preparing to host charity events for their people. “A lot of people have questions about how they can help, or how we can increase safety at our events ... it encourages me,” Ronan said. “We have to bring everyone back together to show that something like this isn’t going to stop us from having a good time and doing what we love.” Kyle Schmisek, 32, who hosts trivia at GLHF, said calls were rolling in from people wanting to donate to the arcade and various victims’ funds. Over the course of 24 hours, he went from a local organizer in gaming to a national one. “It needs to be done so I do it,” he said. “I’ve been sitting around waiting to do something other than just donate, so I’m here to help. But there’s still a lot to be done. We want to help these families, and we’re still working on that.” Schmisek, Campbell and Ronan sat around a table outside Keg & Coin as the Smash Bros. tournament wrapped up, talking shop and devising plans on what to do next. When asked whether the shooting changed anything for them in terms of their involvement in the scene, they each laughed. “This is my livelihood,” Ronan said. “I work at a game shop, I host events, I travel for them. I put a lot of my effort into Smash. I wouldn’t give it up for anything.” Campbell agreed. “Gaming’s not going anywhere for me,” he said. Love HuffPost?

625,625,10131,http://thehill.com/regulation/368425-planned-shift-on-gun-exports-kicks-up-storm,Planned shift on gun exports kicks up storm,"The Trump administration’s expected plan to transfer the licensing of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department has Democratic lawmakers and foreign policy advocates readying for a fight. The proposal under review by the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) has yet to be made public, but experts fear it will lead to less oversight of commercial sales of assault weapons like submachine guns and flame throwers to foreign buyers. ADVERTISEMENT Less oversight, they warn, could make it easier for deadly weapons to end up in the hands of terrorists and drug cartels. “It’s a major change,” said Colby Goodman, director of the Security Assistance Monitor program at the Center for International Policy. “It’s opening up a lot more risk and a lot more opportunity for illegal and illicit trafficking.” The State Department said it is shifting responsibility to Commerce for approving exports of nonmilitary firearms and ammunition that are already commercially available — those under Categories I, II and III on the U.S. Munitions List. The goal is to reduce regulatory burdens on manufacturers and exporters. Under the proposed rules, an administration official told The Hill, firearms and related articles that are uniquely military or that are not otherwise widely available for commercial sale would remain under State Department export licensing controls. In shifting oversight, exporters and manufacturers, including small gunsmiths, would no longer have to register with the State Department’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and pay the $2,250 annual registration fee. But experts say if exporters aren’t forced to register with the federal government, there will be no way to track and no one to prosecute when weapons end up in the wrong hands. “There are plenty of cases when in regular processes weapons have been lost,” said Jeff Abramson, a nonresident senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, adding that these are the weapons often used in human rights abuses. Democrats are particularly upset with one potential change in the proposal. Shifting oversight from the State Department to the Commerce Department, they say, would eliminate congressional review that’s now required under the Arms Export Control Act for any commercial sales of lethal weapons worth $1 million or more. “As you are aware, combat firearms and ammunition are uniquely lethal; they are easily spread and easily modified, and are the primary means of injury, death and destruction in civil and military conflicts throughout the world,” Sens.

In an interview with The Hill, Torres said the Commerce Department has a very different role than the State Department, which leads on foreign affairs. “[Commerce’s] interest is selling U.S.-made goods,” she said. “They aren’t looking at things from a public safety point of view.” Torres said the types of weapons being sold could cause a lot of problems in countries where democracy is fragile. “The State Department has more knowledge about what’s happening on the ground,” she said. The administration, however, disagrees. “The Commerce Department is uniquely qualified to handle these rule changes,” the administration official said in an email to The Hill. “In fact, the Department of Commerce has decades of experience in licensing firearms for export under the Export Administration Regulations. This involves the export, re-export, and transfer (in-country) of 12-gauge shotguns, optical sighting devices for firearms, and crime control equipment.” The official said each export license would go through a rigorous interagency review process that includes the Defense and State departments to ensure national security and human rights concerns are addressed. “The proposed changes will allow the Commerce Department to use its expertise and resources through its in-agency law enforcement unit, and its robust end use verification program,” the official said. “This transfer will not create opportunities to put weapons in the hands of bad actors.” Gun manufacturers and former Obama administration officials say the hysteria over the rule is overblown and premature. The rule, after all, has been in the works since 2012 and is expected to mimic an Obama-era proposal that was slated for release, but stalled after 20 children and six adults were killed in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Kevin Wolf, the former assistant secretary of Commerce for export administration, said gun rights and gun control groups should relax until they’ve seen the actual wording of the rule. “Everybody just chill,” he said. “Anyone who has any concerns should just relax until they see an actual rule to comment on.” Larry Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, said he’s been told the current rule isn’t significantly or materially different than the Obama-era proposal. “It is disingenuous for people like Sen. Cardin and other Democrats to now complain about the policy when the rules were over at [the Office of Management and Budget] and within hours of being published” under Obama, he said. A former administration official familiar with the rule discussions said export licenses still would have been required for assault weapons under the Obama-era rule. Licensing requirements would have been eased, however, for the less sensitive gun parts like screws and springs. “The assumption is the Commerce Department is less restrictive, but the difference is less sensitive items can be treated less sensitively, but more lethal items can be treated more aggressively,” the former official said. The push to change the rules is supported by the National Rifle Association, which says many people who never intend to export a firearm or firearm accessories, like gunsmiths and parts manufacturers, are now required to register with the State Department and pay high fees to operate their business. “The NRA supports the Trump administration’s efforts to complete the reforms and transfer law-abiding firearms and ammunition manufacturers from an export system designed for nuclear submarines and ballistic missiles into one designed around lawful commercial products,” said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker. The State Department’s proposed rule was sent to OIRA on Sept. 26 and is marked as pending review. The office has 90 days to review the rule, but that deadline can be extended indefinitely by the head of the rulemaking agency. The Office of Management and Budget, which oversees OIRA, said it has a longstanding policy of not commenting on rules under review.",Firearm Assault rifle Gun Gun violence Machine gun Rifle Airsoft Guns Trigger National Rifle Association DAX MONTHLY HEDGED TR JPY,A gun used by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.,"The Trump administration’s expected plan to transfer the licensing of gun exports from the State Department to the Commerce Department has Democratic lawmakers and foreign policy advocates readying for a fight.

The accused shooter was identified as 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz, a former student at the school, who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons. Cruz allegedly carried out the shooting with an AR-15, an assault-style rifle that, according to law enforcement, he had purchased legally from a dealer in nearby Coral Springs roughly a year ago. The attack reignited a national debate over gun control and access to assault-style weapons. Stoneman Douglas students have emerged as some of the most vocal advocates of tighter gun restrictions. The protest at the Capitol on Wednesday is one among several student demonstrations calling for new gun control laws. On Tuesday, students at a Florida high school staged a walkout and marched to Stoneman Douglas to call for action.

During the program's “Unplugged” segment, Noah addressed the recent shooting at a mall in Hoover, Ala. that left one dead and two wounded on Thanksgiving night. The person killed by police, 21-year-old black Army veteran Emantic Bradford Jr., who was legally carrying a gun, was mistaken for the shooter and the real shooter could still be at large. “The question I ask myself is how does this s**t keep happening? Cops are called into a situation, they see a black person, and then immediately they shoot,” Noah told his audience. “That’s what they did here. They ran in, they shot the guy, and then they were like ‘We got him.’” ""How many times have we seen a shooter who is white and a man get talked down?” he asked, citing the shooters in Aurora and Charleston. While noting other shooters have killed themselves, Noah said when it comes to black men, it’s “shoot immediately” and “ask questions later.” 'If you’re a black man, you have no business bearing arms at all' — Trevor Noah “There are so many things that bug me about this story. Because by the looks of it, it sounds like this was a good guy with a gun. That’s what they always say, a ‘good guy with a gun stops the crime,’” Noah continued. “But if the good guy with a gun happens to be a black good guy with a gun, they don’t get any of the benefits.” The late-night comedian slammed the Hoover Police Department for their statement declaring they got the shooter, a statement they later apologized for, and how multiple people had reportedly pulled out their guns but that the “only person who was shot by police was a black guy.” Trevor Noah: Trump's 'superhuman stupidity' led president to discount his own administration's climate report “At this point, you start to realize that really the Second Amendment is not intended for black people,” Noah said. “It’s an uncomfortable thing to say, but it’s the truth.

The “Daily Show” host also cited a recent incident involving a black security guard who was shot and killed after being mistaken for an armed assailant. “If you’re black and you’re a man in America, gun rights are not for you,” Noah reiterated. “If you’re a black person in America, gun rights are not for you. It’s as simple as that. In fact, the safest way to sell a black person a gun in America is to say that when you buy a gun you should buy a white person with it and they hold the gun for you.” “Some bulls**t, but it’s the truth,” he added. “Second Amendment was not made for black folks. “",The Daily Show Trevor Noah Television presenter Late-night talk show Late night television Comedian Television Television show Comedy Central,"Trevor Noah said that when the Second Amendment was not intended for black people, it’s not intended for black people.","The “Daily Show” host Trevor Noah got serious Tuesday night on the subjects of guns, police and race.

Mr Bowers, who wrote frequent racist online screeds denouncing Jewish people, is to appear in federal court on Monday, to face several dozen charges. He also faces 11 counts of murder, brought by state authorities. US Attorney Scott Brady said federal prosecutors are seeking approval to pursue the death penalty against Mr Bowers. The 46-year-old suspect was shot by officers and taken into custody after police responded to reports of an attack on the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighbourhood on Saturday morning. He is being treated at the Allegheny General Hospital. On Sunday evening, Jeff Cohen, a member of Tree of Life synagogue and president of Allegheny General Hospital, described how he heard the gunshots break out on Saturday morning. He also revealed he had spoken to the alleged gunman. “I went to see the shooter and the cops that were guarding him. You look at him, I wanted to try and understand why did he do this,” he told CNN. “And I have no answers. I asked him how are you feeling, and he was sort of groggy and said I’m feeling okay. And I introduced myself as Dr Cohen, the president of Allegheny General. And I left. The FBI agent in charge looked at me and says I don’t know how you did that because I’m not sure I could have.” Mr Cohen said he believed it was “time for leaders to lead”. Since the attack on Saturday morning there has been intense debate in the US about whether Donald Trump’s rhetoric has helped create an environment where such incidents are more likely. Mr Cohen said: “The gentleman didn’t appear to be a member of the Mensa society. He listens to the noise, he hears the noise. The noise was telling him his people were being slaughtered. He thought it was time to rise up and do something. He’s completely confused, and the words mean things. The words are leading to people doing things like this.” Story continues Video: Trump and First Lady Visit Pittsburgh in Wake of Shooting Following the shooting, Mr Trump condemned the act of violence as an “antisemitic act” and “pure evil”. “There must be no tolerance for antisemitism in America or for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice,” he added. Critics said the president’s language, frequently aggressive and mocking of people who disagreed with him, was helping create an environment in which such acts were more likely. “This president’s modus operandi is to divide us,” Democratic congressman Adam Schiff told CNN. “It’s not enough that a day on a tragedy he says the right words, if every other day of the year he’s saying things to bring us into conflict with one another.” Supporters of the president, who on Friday had denied his words or actions had inspired accused mail bomber Cesar Sayoc, were quick to dismiss any link between Mr Trump’s language and the gun attack in Pittsburgh, whose alleged perpetrator reportedly wrote disparaging comments about the president on social media and said he was a “globalist, not a nationalist”. The word globalist is often used a slur by antisemites. Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of Homeland Security, told Fox News the president “has made it extraordinarily clear that we will never allow political violence to take root in this country”.

It’s still unclear what set off the violence near the Galleria shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday, as shoppers were getting an early start on post-Thanksgiving sales. Police said a dispute on the upper concourse escalated into a fight, then a volley of gunfire that struck an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl, both of whom survived. AD Crowds immediately fled from the gunshots, stampeding through the food court, jumping over checkout counters and hiding inside stores. AD If Bradford did draw his weapon in the aftermath of the shooting, as police say, he was one of several people to do so, according to AL.com. It’s unclear whether the weapons came out as part of a group dispute, as police have suggested, or in self-defense. Bradford’s relatives have said he had a concealed-handgun license and may have been trying to help people. The Hoover Police Department did not immediately respond when asked whether Bradford aimed his weapon or simply took it out, or whether the gun was still in view when two uniformed officers working as security guards approached him, and one of them opened fire. AD He died on the tile between a GameStop and a Footaction, blood pooled around his head. In time, more officers gathered around the body, and several onlookers took pictures. ""That boy didn’t shoot at nobody,” a man in the corridor said as he filmed. AD “The shooter is down at this time,” an emergency dispatcher announced on the radio. After police backed away from their claim that Bradford shot anyone, his parents hired civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who has previously represented the families of black shooting victims such as Stephon Clark and Trayvon Martin. The attorney demanded police footage of the shooting be released at a news conference on Sunday. He said Bradford was shot in the face, then interrupted his speech as a woman behind him collapsed in grief. AD Bradford is one of more than 850 people shot and killed by police in the United States this year, according to a Washington Post database, and the latest of many black men whose deaths have led to accusations of systemic racism under U.S. law. He grew up near Birmingham and joined the Army last year, though he left before completing advanced training. At a protest outside the mall on Saturday, relatives said Bradford recently came home to help care for his father. AD The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency has taken over the investigation and search for the shooter, and it has been given body camera footage and other evidence from the mall, police said Monday. In a statement, the agency said it would eventually turn over its findings to the district attorney’s office. AD Police offered sympathy to Bradford’s family in their latest statement — and to others affected by “an event so unnecessary on what should have been a peaceful Thanksgiving evening.” “The loss of human life is a tragedy under any circumstances,” the statement said.",Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Shooting of Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Riverchase Galleria Shooting Shopping Centre Gun Police Firearm Police officer Death,"A memorial for the victims of the shooting at the Mall in Hoover, Ala., on Monday.","In a third statement Monday, police raised doubts about whether Bradford even had his gun out when officers encountered him. “We can say with certainty Mr. Bradford brandished a gun during the seconds following the gunshots,” the statement reads, “which instantly heightened the sense of threat to approaching officers responding to the chaotic scene.” AD AD","in a third statement monday, police raised doubts about whether bradford even had his gun out when officers encountered him. police said a dispute on the upper concourse escalated into a fight, then a volley of gunfire that struck an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl, both of whom survived. ad crowds immediately fled from the gunshots, stampeding through the food court, jumping over checkout counters and hiding inside stores. ad if bradford did draw his weapon in the aftermath of the shooting, as police have suggested, or in self-defense. bradford's relatives have said he had a concealed-handgun license and may have been trying to help people",1,1,6,99,8,1,1,99.0,0,99

It was a big outcome and I think in two years, we’ve got to do it even more. I think that’s important to send messages and get things done. I think that’s the only way we can make change right now. “It’s sad. Mental Illness is sad, but [lack of] gun control is sadder. This whole thing about, ‘I guess it wasn’t a terrorist attack,’ just infuriates me.

Action has to take place.” Butler gives Philly a ‘closer’ News of Minnesota’s proposed trade of Jimmy Butler to Philadelphia broke Saturday morning — “four or five days” after Rivers discussed it with Tom Thibodeau, his former assistant who is Minnesota’s coach and team president. “I would say this, it gives [Philadelphia] a closer,” Rivers said. “Jimmy Butler’s a closer and every good team has to have one of those. Before the season started that was the question, you know. At the end of the game if you can get it to [Joel] Embiid at the right spot he can close but bigs are tough so now they actually have a closer and that’s going to make them really good. “You think of the games they lost this year and last year, last three minutes, four minutes, because they couldn’t close games. Now they have Jimmy, that’s going to make a big difference.” Advertisement Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer, whose team joined Toronto as the class of the Eastern Conference through the season’s first three weeks, was less interested in considering how Butler’s addition might benefit Philadelphia. “It’s for the Sixers to figure out,” he said. “I’m sure it’ll make them better.” The trade, which wouldn’t become official until Monday, ends nearly two months of speculation that followed Butler’s trade demand. The Clippers were reportedly a destination the All-Star guard preferred, but the teams hadn’t held substantive trade talks in weeks, according to a source not authorized to speak publicly. Etc.

The move by Gov. Mary Fallin marked a rare defeat in such a conservative state by the National Rifle Association, which strongly backed the measure. The bill is similar to so-called “constitutional carry” legislation adopted in a dozen other states. It would have authorized people 21 and older and military personnel who are at least 18 to legally carry a handgun, either openly or concealed, without a state-issued license or permit. The state currently requires a license to carry a handgun openly or concealed. Fallin cited opposition from the business community and law enforcement authorities for her decision. In a statement announcing the veto, Fallin emphasized her support for the Second Amendment and the right to bear arms and noted she has previously signed concealed and open carry measures. “I believe the firearms laws we currently have in place are effective, appropriate and minimal,” she said. Fallin noted that the bill also would have eliminated the requirement for a training course and reduced the level of background checks to carry a firearm. The veto drew the immediate ire of the NRA. ""Make no mistake, this temporary setback will be rectified when Oklahoma residents elect a new and genuinely pro-Second Amendment governor,"" said Chris Cox, NRA executive director for legislative affairs. He said the governor, who is not permitted under state law to run for a third term, was ignoring her promise during her 2014 re-election campaign to back a ""constitutional carry"" gun law. The measure had passed the Senate by a vote of 33-9 and the House by 59-28. The Legislature already has adjourned its session so lawmakers will not be able to revisit the issue until next year after the election of a new governor. The bill had drawn opposition from the business community and law enforcement authorities, including top officials with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation who have said it could erode public safety. The bureau said it would lose nearly $5 million annually in licensing fees under the new law and have to eliminate about 60 full-time positions. The Tulsa Regional Chamber opposed the bill because it “impairs the right of businesses and property owners to implement safeguards to prohibit untrained individuals with no background checks from carrying guns into their establishment,” according to the Tulsa World. The Oklahoma Second Amendment Association, which wrote and strongly supported the measure, had pushed for a similar bill since 2010. Don Spencer, its president, said he was “disappointed that Oklahoma rights were not respected” by Fallin's veto. “She had a great opportunity to defend our liberty and leave a wonderful legacy and she chose not to,” Spencer said, according the World. Fallin has vetoed gun bills before. In 2014, she rejected a bill requiring state authorities to sign off on applications for federally regulated items such as silencers, short-barreled rifles and automatic weapons within 15 days. But the Legislature overrode her veto and the bill became law anyway. In 2015, she vetoed legislation that restricted businesses from banning guns at parks, fairgrounds and recreational areas, a veto that remained in place.

A sweeping tax bill with the fuel exemption stripped out by the Republicans passed the GOP-controlled House and Senate by wide margins, just days after Delta reacted to the school massacre in Florida by announcing it would no longer offer discount fares to NRA members. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal criticized the Delta controversy as an ""unbecoming squabble"" but said he would sign the broader tax measure in whatever form it passed. Delta, which is based in Atlanta and has 33,000 employees in Georgia, would have been the prime beneficiary of the tax break, estimated to be worth at least $38 million a year to airlines. The political battle at the Georgia Capitol was the latest in the debate over gun control and school safety that flared after the Feb. 14 shooting rampage in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 students and educators dead. Delta did not immediately return messages seeking comment. NRA spokeswoman Catherine Mortensen had no immediate comment. The state Senate's presiding officer, Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, set up the showdown between gun-rights supporters and one of Georgia's biggest private employers when he vowed Monday to stop any tax break that would benefit Delta. ""Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back,"" he tweeted. The dispute stirred fears of damage to Georgia's business-friendly reputation, and politicians in several other states seized on the furor in recent days, urging Delta to move its headquarters. ""Hey @delta — Virginia is for lovers and airline hubs. You're welcome here any time,"" Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, tweeted. The Delta provision barely came up Thursday in either legislative chamber during debate on the underlying tax bill, designed in part to give back to Georgia taxpayers $5.2 billion in extra state revenue expected over the next five years because of the recent federal tax overhaul. Story continues Cagle took a softer tone in celebrating victory Thursday. ""Obviously the political environment does sometimes get a little testy, but in the end, it's all about the product,"" said Cagle, who is running this year to succeed the term-limited governor. ""And the product we have today is something that all of us can be very proud of."" The Senate passed the tax measure 44-10, with Democrats accounting for all of the no votes. The House — which had passed an earlier version with the jet fuel exemption intact before the Delta-NRA controversy erupted — followed with a 135-24 vote. ""It's been strenuous,"" said GOP Sen. Michael Williams, another candidate for governor. ""We've been attacked by the media, we've been attacked by the left. Big corporate has gone after us. And we've stayed strong. We've even stayed strong against our own governor."" House Speaker David Ralston, a Republican, bemoaned the combative tone some had taken toward Delta. But he put some of the blame on the airline, noting the jet fuel exemption wasn't controversial before Delta crossed the NRA. ""I hope they are better at flying airplanes than timing P.R. announcements,"" Ralston said. Among Democrats voting against the tax bill was Sen. Nikema Williams of Atlanta, who applauded companies that have taken swift action on guns after the Florida tragedy. She said Delta's decision to end its NRA discounts led her to support the jet fuel tax break. ""The small steps that Delta and Dick's Sporting Goods are taking, to take a stand and say enough is enough, is what we all need to be doing as adults,"" Williams said. ""We're the leaders of this state and we need to be coming together for solutions, not bullying corporations who are trying to do the right thing."" Dick's Sporting Goods has said it will no longer sell assault-style weapons like the one used in the Florida attack. Critics of the GOP effort to retaliate against Delta have warned it could backfire by harming Georgia's ability to lure businesses — including Amazon, which recently named Atlanta a finalist in its search for a second headquarters. ""It definitely could have an effect when an outside company looks at something that happens this quickly around election time to one of the largest employers in the state,"" said William Hatcher, a professor at Augusta University who studies economic development. ""But will it be the dominant factor? I don't think so."" Delta has helped make Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport the busiest airport in the world.

The exodus of corporate names, ranging from a major insurer to car rental brands and a household moving company, occurred after the NRA launched a counter-offensive against a student-led campaign for tighter U.S. gun ownership laws. At the same time, gun control activists are stepping up pressure on Amazon.com Inc and other online streaming platforms to drop the online video channel NRATV, featuring gun-friendly programming produced by the NRA. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, founded after 20 first-graders were shot and killed at a Connecticut school in 2012, sent letters to Apple Inc, AT&T Inc, Amazon, Alphabet Inc's Google and Roku Inc on Friday, asking them to drop NRATV from their platforms. ""We have been just disgusted by NRATV since its beginning,"" Shannon Watts, founder of the Moms Demand Action group, told Reuters. ""It tries to pit Americans against one another, all in an attempt to further their agenda of selling guns."" AT&T said it does not carry NRATV. None of the other companies immediately responded to requests for comment. The issue of gun control, and the NRA's role in opposing it, became the focus of renewed national debate on Feb. 14, when a former student killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, with an AR-15 assault rifle he had purchased legally. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right of Americans to bear arms. The NRA, which has long used campaign donations and effective lobbying to command political influence, argues that stricter gun control would erode individual rights. The group has not commented on companies cutting ties. Angry student survivors of the shooting have confronted politicians from state lawmakers to U.S. President Donald Trump himself, demanding stricter gun control laws. In response, the NRA and Trump have suggested arming teachers who have received training to deter attackers, a proposal that has been met with skepticism by teachers unions and gun violence experts. TRENDING ON TWITTER Before the corporate defections, nearly two dozen companies nationwide had offered incentives to NRA members, according to ThinkProgress.com, a news site owned by the Center for American Progress Action Fund. The attrition started late Thursday when three rental car brands owned by Enterprise Holdings Inc said they were ending discount programs, and First National Bank of Omaha said it would not renew the NRA's contract to issue a co-branded Visa card. By Friday, the list of defectors expanded to include Symantec Corp, which ended an discount program for its LifeLock identity theft product. Home security company SimpliSafe and Hertz Corp also terminated discount programs. Chubb Ltd said it would stop underwriting a NRA-branded insurance policy for gun owners that covers legal costs in self-defense shootings. Another insurer, MetLife Inc, also said it had ended an auto and home incentive program for NRA members. And North American Van Lines said it was scrapping its an affiliate relationship with the NRA. David Hogg, one of the student survivors of last week's attack who launched the #NeverAgain anti-gun violence movement, said the students would target any company with ties to the NRA, in addition to lawmakers who accept donations. About a dozen other companies with marketing ties to the NRA, including FedEx Corp and Hertz, which offer discount programs, did not respond to requests for comment. SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGNS Activists have also called on public pension funds to divest from gun maker stocks, which were broadly lower on Friday. Meanwhile, an online campaign using the Twitter hashtag #StopNRAmazon picked up steam, putting pressure on Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos to drop the channel. Many of those tweeting are in the entertainment industry. ""Ironic how the @NRA likes to point a finger at what kids watch on TV ... while they spew vile rhetoric on NRAtv, streamed on @Amazon and aimed solely at boosting gun sales,"" wrote screenwriter Randi Mayem Singer.

It just happened in the last day and a half.” But Trump, Rubio and McConnell are dead wrong: Not forcing these conversations is, quite literally, a fatal mistake. ADVERTISEMENT Discussing gun violence has become so poisonous and polarizing that it exerts a strong impact on our everyday lives and personal relationships. Some Americans who have firearms safely stored in their home, won’t bring this topic up lest others think they are Second Amendment zealots with a basement bunker stocked for a coming ammo-pocalypse. Others don’t mention the “G-word” lest they be accused of being a “libtard.” This isn’t healthy — not confronting the reality that kids get shot when they play with unsecured firearms makes such accidents sure to happen. In more public contexts, our historical reluctance to force these conversations has made it more difficult to start them in the first place. It’s hard to have educated and informed exchanges thanks to the Dickey Amendment, a provision inserted into a 1996 federal spending bill mandating that no funds allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be used to “advocate or promote gun control” — enacting a de facto ban on gun violence research — resources the lack of which we literally “die for.” Our unwillingness to talk about guns and gun violence has even made it easy for states to make such discourse downright unlawful. Indiana state law, for example, bars public and private employers from asking employees about whether they own, use, or transport a gun, with no public safety exception. If they do, they can be slapped with a civil suit for economic damages, court costs, and even punitive damages. While this law might make gun owners more comfortable, it puts others at risk by preventing employers from adequately protecting other employees from at-risk colleagues. If Bob in marketing is suicidal, or threatens Mary down in sales, then Bob’s boss is in a really tough position, and might hesitate to ask Bob whether he has a firearm readily at hand in his car trunk in the parking lot. And that hesitation might be fatal. Such restrictions are particularly mystifying when the law affirmatively protects the right to discuss gun ownership, access, and safety — even though such conversations can be discomfiting. In Wollschlauger v. Governor of Florida, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit declared unconstitutional a Florida law that ostensibly protected “patient privacy” by prohibiting physicians from asking patients about their ownership and use of firearms. That law, the court held, violated physicians’ First Amendment rights, interfering with professional standards that require them to ask and educate about firearm ownership. Patients who were uncomfortable with such questions could refuse to answer — and such topics were certainly not the only difficult discussions to emerge in doctor-patient conversations. Our growing reluctance to talk about firearms and firearm violence doesn’t respect the Second Amendment; it turns it into a club used to bully others into silence and submission. This is the opposite of what the Second Amendment is intended to be — the constitutional provision that, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia put it in District of Columbia v. Heller, has “protected the rights of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” Using the Second Amendment as a silencer bastardizes it, undermining the civil discourse essential to democracy, creating and reinforcing a flawed narrative that fundamentally changes what people think gun ownership is about and warps popular understandings of the Second Amendment. That’s how we come to believe that “shall not infringe” means literally that no firearms regulations are permissible, equate gun safety education to gun-grabbing schemes, and misconstrue even pro-Second Amendment Supreme Court cases as unconstitutional judicial activism — all dangerous misconceptions that perpetuate and strengthen the politicization of Second Amendment issues and mass shootings. The first step in preventing gun violence — from domestic assaults with firearms to school shootings like Newtown and Parkland with high body counts — is to talk about them in meaningful ways that go beyond thoughts and prayers and Facebook posts to engagement and research. Without these resources, Second Amendment advocates and opponents won’t find common ground, and the majority of us who are caught in the middle can’t learn from these exchanges. These conversations might get messy, uncomfortable, emotional and downright infuriating, but have them we must. As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in Wollschlaeger, “[m]any are those who must endure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of freedom.” Jody L.

David Katz, a 24-year-old from Baltimore, opened fire at the tournament, killing two people before he turned the gun on himself. The shooting was captured on camera, with several gunshots heard before the feed was disconnected. ""There were nine victims transported by JFRD (local fire and rescue) to area hospitals. Some of those have gunshot wounds. There were two additional gunshot victims that self-transported themselves to local hospitals”, said Sheriff Mike Williams. Three events have been cancelled by EA so the firm can conduct a ""comprehensive review of safety protocols” amid criticism over the lack of security at the event. EA chief executive Andrew Wilson said in a statement that “this is the first time we’ve had to confront something like this as an organization, and I believe the first time our gaming community has dealt with a tragedy of this nature.” He said he was “filled with shock and grief” over the Florida shooting. Taylor Robertson, 28, and Elijah Clayton, 22, who lost their lives this weekend were ""respected, positive and skilled competitors”, he added. Concerns about security at such events have been ongoing. In 2015, two men drove with weapons from Iowa to the Pokémon World Championship in Boston and posted messages about plans to carry out “another Boston massacre”. In December, the Call of Duty World League tournament held in Dallas was evacuated - twice - due to bomb threats. Competitor Derek Jones of Santa Fe, New Mexico, was sitting outside the venue on Sunday when he heard the gunshots. He said he didn’t notice any security at the venue - something that he has complained about in the past. “I’ve been telling them this for a while that you need to make the players feel safe,” Jones said. Story continues Industry insiders claim security hasn't caught up with the popularity of eSports. The market was valued at $1.5 billion in 2017 and global eSports revenue is expected to grow 26pc by 2020 “Unfortunately, this was a matter of when not if. Esport event security, in general, has been extremely poor over the years, we should’ve stepped it up long ago,' wrote Cristian Tamas, the director of esports programs for Twitch, the platform that broadcasts gamers’ live streams. “I’ve been saying events NEED better security,” Seth Abner, a popular “Call of Duty” player, tweeted. “Such a damn shame that now event coordinators will respond after a tragedy happens.

The Jacksonville, Florida event was held at a venue named Chicago Pizza, which was live-streaming the tournament on Amazon-owned game streaming platform Twitch when at least nine shots were heard. Investigators are examining video clips posted online that appeared to capture the scene right before the shooting began, Sheriff Williams said.

Unfortunately, this is a reality that has become all too familiar across the U.S. From Pittsburgh, Aurora, Parkland, Orlando, Las Vegas, Newtown and South Carolina, it is clear that firearms violence has become a public health epidemic in America. As president of the American College of Physicians (ACP) our professional organization represents members who have seen first-hand the devastating impact firearms violence has had on our patients and the communities we serve. The failure to implement meaningful and long-lasting gun control legislation undermines our country’s and our health care system’s foundational values. ADVERTISEMENT On Tuesday, Oct. 30, ACP updated a comprehensive set of recommendations to support the public’s health in our policy paper, Reducing Firearm-Related Injuries and Deaths in the U.S. Originally published in 2014, the paper reaffirms our position that firearms violence is a critical threat to the health of our country. The new recommendations support laws to prohibit persons with a history of domestic violence — including persons subject to restraining orders —from buying and possessing firearms; support extreme risk prevention laws to allow family members to seek an immediate court order to remove guns from a family member who is at risk of using firearms to inflict harm on themselves or others; and support laws to require adults to store guns and ammunition safely and securely. The paper also reaffirms ACP’s call for a ban on the sale of “assault” weapons and a ban on bump stocks and large-capacity ammunition magazines, with additional guidance to legislators on how to define which weapons should be subject to such a ban. ACP has been advocating for a shift in the narrative on gun violence for two decades and has recently developed policy recognizing hate crimes as a public health issue. In today’s landscape and in light of the recent tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, which was fueled by anti-Semitism, ACP recommends that physicians address the increase in firearms-related injuries and deaths with legislators and with patients. A pledge in the annals of internal medicine urges physicians to counsel patients on safe firearm behaviors and to make it a priority to take further action when a patient is at risk. These might be difficult conversations to have with patients, but they are critically important to our public health. While we have broadened the national dialogue on mental health and how it relates to gun violence, more must be done to truly move the needle forward. ACP has long called for increased access to mental health services — particularly for patients who may pose a risk of harming themselves or others. We recommend that all physicians be trained to work with patients who are living with a mental illness and that mental health services be consistently available to patients in need throughout their lives — surely that’s something both sides of the aisle can rally behind.

Nikolas Cruz, 19, was detained without resistance shortly after the February 14 attack in Parkland, north of Miami, and was questioned in the Broward County Sheriff's Office. According to the transcript of the interrogation, detective John Curcio offered him a glass of water. ""I do not deserve it,"" Cruz remarked. When the officer briefly left the room to look for water anyway, Cruz said to himself: ""Kill me, just kill me."" Then he told the detective that demons in his head -- which had started tormenting him years earlier -- told him to ""buy weapons, kill animals and destroy everything."" ""What are the demons?"" the detective asked. ""The voices,"" Cruz said. ""The evil side"". ""What does your voice say to you?"" Curcio asked. ""Burn. Kill. Destroy,"" he replied. Cruz said he had attempted suicide two months before the attack -- after his mother's death in November 2017 -- with an overdose of the painkiller Ibuprofen. Two years before that episode, he tried and failed to commit suicide by alcohol poisoning. Cruz said that he was depressed by his lack of friends and his loneliness. When the detective asked him why he had decided to buy a semiautomatic rifle -- an AR-15 -- the one he allegedly used in the massacre, he replied: ""Because it looks 'cool.'"" Cruz bought the rifle legally.

The news outlet reported that, within a day of the shooting, ATF leadership was flooded with internal and external messages asking whether the bureau had approved the supplementary devices used by Las Vegas gunman Stephen Paddock, and whether it planned to ban them. “Are these ‘ATF approved’ as advertised?” ATF Director Tom Brandon asked technology branch chief Earl Griffith the day after the shooting, according to emails obtained by USA Today. ADVERTISEMENT Emails showed that public affairs staff encouraged bureau employees to avoid referring to bump stocks as ATF ""approved,"" but rather to explain that the ATF has the power to ""classify"" or ""evaluate"" the devices, which allow weapons to fire at a faster rate, mimicking machine guns. Other emails showed officials discussing an uptick in demand for bump stocks, as well as criticism from outside observers over the ATF's perceived inaction on the devices. ATF spokesman Brad Engelbert told USA Today that the emails reflect individual personal opinions, and are not the official position of the ATF. A call to ban bump stocks found broad support after the Las Vegas shooting, which left 58 people dead and hundreds more wounded.

Blame rained down on the ATF after gunfire showered concertgoers from a 32nd-floor room at the Mandalay Bay hotel Oct. 1, leaving 58 dead and more than 800 injured. Critics popped up everywhere – cable news anchors and politicians on both sides of the aisle, the National Rifle Association and Gabrielle Giffords’ anti-gun-violence group, and even from the ATF’s own ranks of current and former agents. The focus was Slide Fire, a plastic add-on known as a “bump stock” that allowed Stephen Paddock to run through more than 1,100 rounds of ammunition in 10 minutes. Bump stocks were affixed to half of Paddock’s guns. Since 2010, up to 520,000 of the devices have been purchased in the USA, the Department of Justice reported. The emails offer an unvarnished look inside the agency as it reacted to the tragedy. They help explain why, despite almost immediate bipartisan support for a ban and an endorsement several months later by President Donald Trump, bump stocks continue to be available in most of the country. As ATF agents in Nevada helped police investigate the massacre, the political storm began building in Washington. Were bump stocks legal? Even the ATF director wasn’t sure. “Are these ‘ATF approved’ as advertised?” Tom Brandon asked technology branch chief Earl Griffith the day after the shooting in one of the 5,300 pages of emails released this month after Freedom of Information Act requests by USA TODAY and Democracy Forward, a left-leaning watchdog of the executive branch. Hours later, Brandon had his answer. “They are approved as advertised. ... We have also approved other bump-fire type devices in the past,” Griffith wrote. The technology branch determines whether new devices are legal. Brandon traveled to the agency’s facility in West Virginia four days after the shooting to fire a gun with a bump stock himself, the emails show. Later, he testified to Congress that in the interest of public safety, a law should ban them. Behind the scenes, the agency seemed blindsided by the criticism. “We are getting killed right now,” a public affairs staff member wrote to a colleague Oct. 5. “We, ATF, are getting hammered with the narrative we approved the bump stock. … It’s extremely political now with the NRA and some GOP congressmen jumping on us. We are in crisis mode,” another wrote two days later. The ATF withheld the names of the staff members. Soon, public affairs staff urged media via email to avoid saying the devices were ATF “approved,” as manufacturers claimed. Instead, they said, more accurate language would clarify that the federal agency has the power only to “classify” and “evaluate” machine-gun-like devices. Asked about the internal emails, ATF spokesman Brad Engelbert said employees “hold a wide range of personal views and opinions on the topic of the day.” “These individual personal opinions are not the official position of ATF,” Engelbert said. Eleven states – California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington – have banned bump stocks. Across the nation, more than a dozen other cities and states are considering bans. But a year after the Vegas massacre, online retailers still market the plastic bolt-on stocks for less than $200, and the ATF has evaluated more than 180,000 comments on the ban proposed by the Department of Justice. A final decision could come in the next month. Bump stocks effectively hobble the ATF’s authority to regulate the sale and ownership of machine guns by making regular semiautomatic weapons function like a machine gun. The device has been allowed to remain on the market through three presidential administrations, beginning in 2003, the emails show. The ATF has had the authority to make owners register machine guns dating back to a 1930s law and Al Capone’s Tommy guns – among the few weapons tracked by the government, a time-consuming and expensive licensing process. Bump stocks short-circuit that process by combining two legal devices, a plastic stock and a firearm, that together function like a machine gun. The bump stock harnesses the recoil of the rifle to accelerate trigger pulls, technically “bumping” the trigger for each shot after it bounces off the shooter’s shoulder. Former agent Michael Bouchard, president of the ATF Association of agency retirees, wrote to lawmakers the week of the shooting to defend the agency from criticism that it had approved the devices. Bouchard faulted Congress. “We would like to clarify this confusing issue to protect honorable ATF employees from false allegations that they chose to make this item legal, when it was the law that prohibited them from regulating the item,” Bouchard wrote. In an interview with USA TODAY, he said the ATF is squeezed not only by regulations but also by gun manufacturers, who argue for consistency in rulings and will sue over any deviation based on political pressure or public safety, which they say shouldn’t be part of the legal determination. Pleas for the ATF to take an aggressive stance and ban bump stocks came within a day of the shooting. Retired ATF agent David Chipman was among the first to jump into the fray. “Only group quieter than NRA this week is ATF. An agency with vast experience preventing gun violence silenced when they should preach,” Chipman wrote on Twitter. The internal ATF emails indicate that criticism reverberated around the agency. It was clipped and shared up the ranks to the director’s desk. “Agents were collectively stunned about what happened, and then there’s universal agreement that this needs to be changed urgently and legislatively because it’s a workaround to circumvent the regulations on machine guns,” Chipman told USA TODAY. As public support swelled that week for a ban, the NRA made a rare call for increased ATF regulation of the device, a move the group preferred to legislation that could prompt a broader anti-gun vote in Congress. Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action, took credit for stopping the imminent passage of the bipartisan legislation that would have banned the device in an online interview Oct. 26 with YouTube personality James Yeager. “We needed to slow the process down,” he said. “We are strategically working to make sure really bad policy doesn’t become law.” Two days later, Brandon and his assistant director for public affairs noted a surge in interest in bump stocks. In an email exchange, they discussed a Boston Globe article that showed the “once obscure devices flying off the shelves” and selling at five times their sales price on the secondary market. “Supply and demand = $,” Brandon emailed Chris Shaefer on Oct. 28. “Absolutely amazing … right?” Shaefer responded. The ATF emails trace the path of misinformation about approvals of the bump stock and similar devices. The week after the shooting, Brandon and others briefed Trump about the approval of the Slide Fire device in 2010. In ensuing TV appearances, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway pinned blame on the Obama administration’s ATF, adding that as a result, the device couldn’t be regulated under law. Trump picked up Conway’s language months later in announcing a regulatory ban – one that has yet to start. “Obama Administration legalized bump stocks. BAD IDEA,” the president tweeted in March. “As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period. We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns.” The internal emails lay out a longer regulatory timeline for the devices. A total of 25 “accelerator devices,” including bump stocks, were analyzed beginning in 2003, under President George W. Bush’s ATF. One bump stock was approved in April 2017 – well into the Trump administration. Brandon has been part of senior leadership at the ATF since 2011 and began working at the agency in 1989. He took over after the previous director, B. Todd Jones, resigned amid gun rights backlash over a regulatory ban of ammunition that could pierce bulletproof vests. Last December, the ATF issued its first notice of rule-making to ban bump stocks under the National Firearms and Gun Control acts. In February, Trump signed a memo directing Attorney General Jeff Sessions to ban the devices, accelerating the process. Both actions came as bipartisan legislation stalled on Capitol Hill. That started the formal rule-making at ATF that continues as the agency evaluated the flood of comments and at the end of last week sent the rule on to the Office of Management and Budget for a review of up to 90 days. Bouchard, the retired agent organization leader, said he was not surprised Congress shied away from a clear legislative fix and instead pushed the agency to change a rule about the devices. “It’s the perfect way to kick the can down the road, knowing that nothing would be done for months or years – and then there’s likely to be a civil case,” Bouchard said, referring to the anticipated raft of lawsuits by bump stock owners and manufacturers to overturn any ban. The ATF’s comment period on the rules banning bump stocks closed in June. The ban clarifies that bump-stock-type devices would be considered machine guns because they allow “a continuous firing cycle with a single pull of the trigger” and owners would need to surrender or destroy them. The agency spent months wading through comments from individuals and form letters – led by pro-gun groups such as Gun Owners of America and gun control groups such as Giffords’, according to an analysis by The Trace, an online news site focused on gun policy. If the rule is approved by the ATF and published in the Federal Register, the devices could become illegal immediately, and possession would carry a federal fine and prison time. The NRA lobbied the ATF in its formal comment on the rule for an amnesty period allowing bump stock owners time to destroy or turn over the devices. Representatives from Democracy Forward, the group that sued to accelerate the release of the internal emails, said the ban is likely to be published soon. Democracy Forward is not the only group that took an interest in the ATF’s internal debate over ways to reverse course on bump stocks. Mississippi Second Amendment attorney Stephen Stamboulieh received copies of the emails and fed some to pro-gun online news sites such as Ammoland. Stamboulieh said he is poised with a Washington plaintiff to fight for an injunction against the anticipated ban. He said the ATF would break the law and create 500,000 unwitting felons overnight. “I’m going to sue them day one,” Stamboulieh said.",Stephen Paddock Mandalay Bay 2017 Las Vegas Strip shooting McCarran International Airport  Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department News Shooting Police October 1,"The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Las Vegas after the mass shooting in October.","Within hours of the worst mass shooting in U.S. history a year ago in Las Vegas, the federal agency in charge of regulating guns found itself under pressure to ban a rapid-fire device and penned in by legal boundaries that officials said prevented them from acting quickly, according to newly disclosed emails from inside the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Jeffrey Ziegler, 53, was found guilty on charges of assault with attempt to murder and possession of a firearm in commission of a felony for shooting at 14-year-old Brennan Walker in April. Ziegler could face up to life in prison. His bond has been revoked and he is in custody awaiting sentencing. What happened? On April 12, Walker missed the morning school bus. Left without options, he attempted to walk to school. Problem is, he didn't quite know the way. So, as Walker wandered through an unfamiliar neighborhood, he decided he needed to try to get some directions. He ended up knocking on the door of a house belonging to Ziegler and his wife. Ziegler's wife answered the door, and apparently thought Walker was attempting to break into the house. She called 911, and Ziegler came to the door and chased Walker away from the house with a loaded shotgun. Walker fled, and security footage shows Ziegler running out of the house with the gun pointed. After Walker is off camera, Ziegler fires one shot in Walker's direction, which fortunately missed. Walker was surprised by the couple's reaction to him knocking on their door. ""I knocked on her door a few times and she came down yelling at me before I could say anything and she thought I was trying to break into her house,"" Walker told WXYZ-TV at the time. ""I was trying to explain to her that I wanted to get directions to go to my school. I told her, 'No, I go to Rochester High; I'm just looking for directions to Rochester High.'"" Security footage tells the story Ziegler claimed in court that there was ""a lot more to the story than what's being told,"" but the home security footage clearly shows Walker's knock being met with Ziegler's armed threat and eventually a shotgun blast.

An estimated 200,000 people marched in favor of tighter gun restrictions in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, as part of a national and international movement prompted by the massacre at MSD. The movement was organized by victims who survived the mass killing. On Sunday, Kashuv told CBS’ ""Face The Nation"" that he wants to see sensible solutions to prevent school violence. But he also firmly believes the Second Amendment must be protected. ""There's a silent minority at Stoneman Douglas who agrees with me completely,"" he said. Does he believe his voice is being heard? Kashuv said student voices like his are being shut out of the conversation. “And what I saw at the march yesterday which really frustrated me is that I have a different point of view, but what really concerned me was that how come I wasn't invited to speak at the march because as Americans we all have different point of views. And it's important to represent them all equally,"" he said. A ban on ""assault weapons"" and high capacity magazines will not solve the issue, Kashuv said. Instead, he blames the mass killing on law enforcement's failures to enforce already existing laws and practices. “And I find it ironic that after all this and we've seen so many different government failures, we want to trust the government even more,” Kashuv said. Are more guards the answer? A possible solution is more armed guards in schools, he said. The Marshal Program in Florida, for example, allows properly trained officers, veterans and unemployed veterans get training in protecting schools, Kashuv said. Asked if he’d like to see more armed guards at his school, Kashuv said: Absolutely. I mean we saw it Maryland. He stopped the shooter. He did his job and had the cowards of Broward done their job, I think that the count in Parkland would have been much lower. We saw that in Maryland that a good guy with a gun stopped the bad guy with the gun. The only way to stop an active shooter on campus is to have another person to eliminate him. Kashuv said he he is concerned that lawmakers could enact laws that will hurt the American public at large. “We have to make sure that the laws that we're enacting don't hurt America on a national scale,"" he said. “And that's why I think that we have to sit down with all members of this issue. Okay, sit down with me and David Hogg or Cameron Kasky and debate this and find a common middle ground because that's the only way that we're going to protect the American people.""",Spokesperson Businessperson Public Relations Journalist White-collar worker Television Television presenter Newscaster Suit Broadcaster,"Kyle Kashuv, a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, spoke at a rally on Sunday.","Kyle Kashuv is a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, but his views are different from most of his peers who participated in the March for Our Lives rallies.

915,915,100330,https://us.cnn.com/2018/10/29/health/physicians-gun-safety-recommendations-study/index.html,Doctors release new recommendations to reduce gun violence,"(CNN) A wave of hate-filled gun violence has swept the United States in the past few days, and now a physicians' group is releasing new recommendations to reduce firearm injuries and deaths nationwide. On Saturday morning, a man sprayed bullets into a Pittsburgh synagogue, killing 11 people who were attending services , law enforcement said. Federal prosecutors have filed hate crime charges against a suspect. Another man is accused of shooting and killing two African-Americans on Wednesday at a grocery store in Kentucky in what is being investigated as a hate crime . The incident came moments after he tried to enter a predominantly black church nearby, police said. On Monday, the American College of Physicians released new recommendations on how doctors can play a role in reducing gun violence across the country. The recommendations, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, had been planned for release before the recent wave of violence. Those recommendations urge doctors to more regularly ask whether patients have guns in their home and to counsel patients on gun safety. The recent shootings emphasize ""how important and poignant it is for there to be policies that can be really effective in keeping guns away from both those who are either a risk to themselves or to others,"" said Dr. Ana María López, president of the American College of Physicians ""Firearm-related injuries and deaths really continue to be a part of what is harmful to patients and families,"" she said. ""Gun violence remains an issue in our country, unfortunately, and if this paper can help move hearts and minds to action to prevent these tragedies from happening, that would be a great achievement."" Where physicians stand on gun policies The American College of Physicians , a community of internal medicine specialists and subspecialists, says it's the largest medical specialty organization in the United States and has members in more than 145 countries worldwide. The group has pressed Congress and state lawmakers for the adoption of policies to reduce firearm-related deaths and injuries for more than 20 years, according to the new paper. The paper builds on and expands policies that the American College of Physicians approved in 2014 , calling for a public health approach to preventing firearm injuries and deaths. Now, some new or revised policy positions include the college supporting ""appropriate regulation of the purchase of legal firearms to reduce firearms-related injuries and deaths"" and child access prevention laws that hold firearm owners accountable for the safe storage of firearms. The paper also noted how the group supports the enactment of extreme risk protection order laws, which allow families and law enforcement to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from individuals who may be a risk to themselves or others. Indiana, California, Such laws -- variously known as ERPOs, gun violence restraining orders and "" red-flag laws "" -- are in effect in Connecticut Washington and, most recently, Oregon Also, the college favors the enactment of legislation to ban the manufacture, sale, transfer and ownership of rapid-killing semiautomatic firearms for civilian use that are designed to have increased rapid-killing capacity and large-capacity magazines, along with retaining the current ban on automatic weapons for civilian use. JUST WATCHED Weapons you can purchase legally in the US Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Weapons you can purchase legally in the US 01:55 ""Although there is more to learn about the causes of firearm violence and the best methods to prevent it, the available data support the need for a multifaceted and comprehensive approach to reducing firearm violence that is consistent with the Second Amendment,"" the authors wrote. The National Rifle Association has not responded to a request for comment on the paper. Last year, after the deadly mass shooting at a concert in Las Vegas , the NRA issued a statement noting in part that it ""believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations. In an increasingly dangerous world, the NRA remains focused on our mission: strengthening Americans' Second Amendment freedom to defend themselves, their families and their communities."" The new American College of Physicians position paper reinforced the importance of doctors speaking to their patients about gun safety, especially as it relates to mental health, domestic violence and children. A separate research letter published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics on Monday said that charges associated with emergency department visits for gun-related injuries among children younger than 18 amount to an average of $270 million per year in the United States. ""We speak with our patients about, 'do you use a seat belt?' If they ride a bike or ride a motorbike, 'do you use a helmet?' So these are public health issues, and it's similar to ask patients if there's a gun in the home,"" López said. Even doctors might misjudge gun death frequency Another study published in Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday finds that many adults in the US -- including health care professionals -- misperceive the frequency of gun-related deaths. That study involved surveying 3,811 respondents about the frequency of deaths in their state that were by firearm homicide, firearm suicide or other methods. The researchers compared survey responses with data on violent deaths from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's web-based injury statistics query and reporting system. The data showed that, between 2014 and 2015, more suicides than homicides occurred in every state, and suicide by firearm was the most frequent cause of violent death in 29 states. Yet the researchers found that only 13.5% of the adults surveyed correctly identified the most frequent cause of violent death in their state. Additionally, only 20% of health care professionals answered correctly. For violent deaths involving firearms specifically, 25.9% of respondents correctly identified the most frequent intent, the researchers found. ""Our findings suggest that correcting misperceptions about the relative frequency of firearm-related violent deaths may make persons more cognizant of the actuarial risks to themselves and their family, thus creating new opportunities for prevention,"" the researchers wrote. 'An enormous public health problem' When talking to patients about guns, ""the chief difficulties doctors face are the ones they bring themselves: They are not necessarily sufficiently informed about the topic or how to proceed with discussions of firearms,"" said Dr. Garen Wintemute, an emergency medicine physician and director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Davis , who was not involved in the study or the new position paper. ""Our group and others are developing resources to help,"" said Wintemute, who with his colleagues has developed educational handouts with firearm safety strategies for patients and health care providers. ""Patients are generally quite willing to have conversations with physicians about firearms, when the patients see the conversations as relevant and understand the position is well-informed. In this way, discussing firearms is no different from discussing other sensitive topics,"" he said. ""I talk with patients about firearms almost every shift I work as an emergency physician."" As for the American College of Physicians' new paper, Wintemute said that it was ""carefully thought through"" and that the recommendations are in line with scientific evidence. ""It shows a continuing willingness on the part of the American College of Physicians to exercise leadership in an area where physicians have traditionally been less involved than they should be,"" he said. The paper represented one of the ways to address America's gun violence problem by ""focusing on the agent of injury, which is a firearm,"" said David Hemenway, professor of health policy and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health , who was not involved in the position paper. ""The evidence is overwhelming that firearm violence in the United States -- firearms killing people, scaring people, injuring people -- is an enormous public health problem,"" he said. Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team. A 2015 data visualization by Martin Grandjean, a researcher at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, indicates that more Americans have died by guns in the United States since 1968, including suicide deaths, than by combat in all of the wars in American history. ""More Americans have been killed from guns in the United States since I graduated from college than have been killed on all the battlefields in all the wars in US history, including all the Americans in the Civil War and World War II and so forth,"" Hemenway said.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. The Tallahassee Police are investigating allegations by four black students at Florida A&M University that a white man brandished a gun and harassed them at an off-campus apartment complex. The weekend altercation, which was captured in a social media video, shows a man in a baseball cap denying the students entry to the building and elevator in the Stadium Centre residence before pulling out a gun. According to the police report, the incident occurred at 12:30 a.m. Saturday and is being investigated as an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, without intent to kill. Isaiah Butterfield, a junior at Florida A&M who filmed the incident, told NBC News that he and his friends were waiting to be let into the building by another friend, a resident of the complex, when the man approached them. “He walked past us and opened the door and he told us we weren’t getting into the building unless we had a key,” Butterfield said. “We were thinking, 'Why would he even say anything to us?' We were confused.” After the man approached the students a second time, Butterfield decided to start recording. “In Tallahassee, there’s a lot of people with their own racial opinions,” said Butterfield. “It doesn’t sound like a place where people of color are invited or welcomed.” Let our news meet your inbox.

The two have an altercation, with Chad asking the man: “What’s your problem? You’re not just man enough to go about your day?” “We literally met Chad that night. We didn’t really know Chad like that,” Butterfield said. “He was there and heard what was going on, and he stepped up. I commend him for that.” Inside the building, the man tells the students to find another elevator, declaring to them, “this is my elevator.” As the altercation escalates, the man pulls out his gun and keeps it by his side. “He made sure that we saw the gun,” said Butterfield. “He was holding his arm in a way to emphasize.” A man pulled out a gun during an altercation with students at an off-campus residence in Tallahassee at Florida A&M University. _IsaiahNoThomas / Twitter One of the students, Fitzroy Rhoden, is heard in the video asking the man: “Sir, you bring out your gun. What’s your purpose for that?” The man then apologizes and puts the gun in his back pocket. Despite the weapon being out, Butterfield wasn’t concerned that the man would shoot at them, saying he thought it was more of a “if you make me use it, I’m going to use it” kind of threat. The students began to ask the older man if he is a resident of the building, considering the apartments were predominately rented by college students. “My friend asked him, ‘Do you even live here, where’s your key?’” said Butterfield. The video then shows the man respond, pulling out keys and a gun. In an email shared by Butterfield, Stadium Centre management addressed the situation, stating: ""We are cooperating with the police during their investigation and it has been determined that the person in the elevator is not a resident. Firearms are prohibited on our property and we take this matter very seriously."" Tallahassee police spokesman, Damon Miller Jr., told NBC News the department is still conducting interviews as part of the investigation. Many on social media are identifying the man in the video as the general manager of Baymont Inn & Suites Tallahassee Central. On Tuesday, Baymont Tallahassee released a statement on their Instagram account confirming they were aware of the situation and that the general manager has since been fired. The man identified in reports did not respond to request for comment from NBC News on Wednesday. After the incident, Butterfield says he felt embarrassed and singled out by the man, but recognizes the altercation as being bigger than a local issue. “There are people out here targeting young black males to retaliate in a violent way just so they can retaliate also and use deadly force and be protected by the law due to Stand Your Ground,” said Butterfield. “And that’s a setup.”",Florida A&M University Student Black people Song Dude Afro-punk College  Man Music,A video posted on Twitter by a Florida A&M student that was captured on social media after a white man was attacked by a white man.,"Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Scott Beierle spewed misogynistic and racist hate online in a series of YouTube videos. Some believe the 40-year-old may have carried out the attack as an act of revenge on women for rejecting his romantic advances. In one of his YouTube videos he sympathized with Elliot Rodger, a self-described ""Incel” which stands for ""involuntarily celibate."" The 22-year-old murdered multiple people near the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2014 before turning the gun on himself. The shooting in Tallahassee is the third deadly attack this year in which Rodger has been praised by an assailant. In April, the man accused of mowing down 25 people in Toronto, killing 10, idolized Rodger and also called himself an “Incel.” Another admirer of Rodger was Nikolas Cruz, the social misfit charged with carrying out the Parkland school massacre on Valentine’s Day. There's an estimated 40,000 other “Incels” out there and the number is growing, according to those knowledgeable about the subject. Judith Taylor is an expert on the ""Incel"" phenomenon. “This is a very scary movement,” she told Inside Edition. “It's leaderless and it really takes its power from the internet. It really collects people who feel socially dislocated and it gives them scripts to follow.""

Nikolas Cruz, 19, was detained without resistance shortly after the February 14 attack in Parkland, north of Miami, and was questioned in the Broward County Sheriff's Office. According to the transcript of the interrogation, detective John Curcio offered him a glass of water. ""I do not deserve it,"" Cruz remarked. When the officer briefly left the room to look for water anyway, Cruz said to himself: ""Kill me, just kill me."" Then he told the detective that demons in his head -- which had started tormenting him years earlier -- told him to ""buy weapons, kill animals and destroy everything."" ""What are the demons?"" the detective asked. ""The voices,"" Cruz said. ""The evil side"". ""What does your voice say to you?"" Curcio asked. ""Burn. Kill. Destroy,"" he replied. Cruz said he had attempted suicide two months before the attack -- after his mother's death in November 2017 -- with an overdose of the painkiller Ibuprofen. Two years before that episode, he tried and failed to commit suicide by alcohol poisoning. Cruz said that he was depressed by his lack of friends and his loneliness. When the detective asked him why he had decided to buy a semiautomatic rifle -- an AR-15 -- the one he allegedly used in the massacre, he replied: ""Because it looks 'cool.'"" Cruz bought the rifle legally. The transcript was released on Monday after the judge in charge of the case, Elizabeth Scherer, approved a motion presented by the Miami Herald and Sun Sentinel, among other media, arguing the public had a right to know its contents.

But laws are not only about enforcement and punishment. They are also about setting the ordinary norms of what people find acceptable and unacceptable in everyday life. Even laws that look unworkable can sometimes work. AD AD One example of how this can work is anti-smoking laws. Over the past 15 years, countries such as Ireland have introduced general legal bans on smoking in the workplace. This means, for example, smoking was prohibited in pubs in Ireland, where drinking and smoking seemed to go together. On the face of it, this ban seemed unenforceable, as it was unlikely that the police would arrest smokers, and the fine was, in any event, relatively small. Irish people are also not noted for their willingness to obey legal rules that seem nonsensical and inconvenient (jaywalking, for example, is nearly universal). However, the ban worked. The reason for its effectiveness was not that smokers irrationally feared they would be caught and punished. It was that the law shifted everyone’s default expectations. Previously, the norm had been that people who wanted to smoke in public places could smoke, and those who did not like it would have to accept it. Now, that norm shifted, so that smoking was no longer the default. Nonsmokers who did not like the smell and the increased cancer risk felt empowered to complain. Smokers felt less able to resist. The result was that the ban effectively became self-enforcing. Pro-gun organizations understand this dynamic. AD AD This plausibly helps explain much of the lobbying activity of the NRA and the laws passed by pro-gun politicians. The last three decades have seen a strong push for states to pass ‘open carry’ laws that allow people to visibly carry firearms. They have also seen a concerted effort to widen the number of places in which people are allowed to have firearms. This can be understood as a massive effort in norm engineering. If many people carry guns around with them as part of their everyday activity, and if there are ever fewer places where people cannot carry guns, then guns will seem to be an ordinary and normal part of everyday life. This will obviously make it harder to restrict firearms and perhaps partly counter the fact that the percentage of families owning guns is declining in the United States. It is unclear whether President Trump’s suggestion that teachers should be armed was guided by any long-term strategy or was a temporarily attractive proposal. It, too, may be seen as normalizing guns in a context where they had not previously been widely accepted. This has implications for anti-gun organizations, too. AD AD Anti-gun groups, too, are aware of the dynamics of norms. Much of their activity over the past several weeks has been aimed at delegitimizing organizations such as the NRA, e.g. by putting pressure on businesses to withdraw from NRA affinity deals. Over the medium term, they are likely to increase their efforts to roll back the normalization of guns. In the long run, the norm-setting role of laws may give them hope that clear laws can have significant consequences. It would be hard, for example, for a new semiautomatic weapons ban to stop people from using the many semiautomatic weapons that are already in private hands. However, even when laws are hard to enforce universally, they can shape people’s broad expectations about what is acceptable and what is unacceptable in everyday life. A country where it is considered aberrant to possess near-military grade weapons and where guns were again banned in many public places would likely have very different politics around guns than the country in which pro-gun and anti-gun advocates live today.",Donald Trump Robert Mueller Gun control Washington  Crowd Almightywind   The Washington Post,A rally in support of gun control in San Francisco in October.,"While this is a valid question, there are reasons to think strong gun control laws might have consequences even where they seem ineffective.

A ... threat? Yes. A threat. According to WTVF-TV, at least four Nashville-area gay bars received the flyers, and some people are calling the content of the flyers ""targeted hate mail."" Melvin Brown, the owner of Nashville's Stirrup, said that his establishment was one that received the offending postcard-style mailer. The postcard, as you can see above, follows a red, white, and blue theme and features the letters ""LGBT,"" which, in this case, appear to stand for ""Liberty,"" ""Guns,"" ""Beer,"" and ""Trump."" Brown said that the photo of the gun was especially chilling. ""When you put a picture of an assault rifle on there — which was used in the Pulse shooting — and you mail it to every LGBT bar in Nashville, that is coming from a hateful place,"" Brown said. ""To say that it's disturbing is an understatement."" Brown was referring to the 2016 mass killing of at least 49 victims at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, Florida. The postcard's front has a ""MAGA"" stamp on it and a return address that locates to an empty Nashville lot. Brown said that he feels the flyers are tied to the upcoming midterm elections, although the mailer does not appear to affiliate itself with a particular political party or a candidate. ""The midterms are right around the corner and I think somebody is trying to incite a reaction,"" Brown explained. Anything else? Brown also spoke to NBC News, where he expounded on his feelings that the ""disturbing"" mailer was sent for a reason. “We live in a post-Pulse world in the LGBTQ community, especially in the bar scene,” Brown explained. “To see somebody send a postcard that had a picture of the weapon used in one of the deadliest assaults in this nation’s history, and one that happened at an LGBTQ bar, and to send that image to LGBTQ bars, to me is not a coincidence.” Chris Sanders, who is executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, said the mailers were sent to intimidate, and suggested that the mailers could be politically motivated, since some gay bars in the area host voter registration drives. “This has a very aggressive tone about it,” Sanders warned. “It doesn’t use many words, but it uses a lot of images I think are meant to threaten us. The community's message back is, ‘Yes this is frightening, but we’re going to turn out and vote regardless.’” A spokesperson for the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department said that while the department is aware of the incident, there is no open investigation at the time of this writing. The spokesperson noted that extra officers were dispatched to patrol the areas in which gay bars are located.

The campaign appears to be part of a national campaign calling for companies to cut ties with the group in the aftermath of several high profile shootings, most notably with the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla. The gun lobbying group claims in its lawsuit, which targets Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the New York State Department of Financial Services and Maria Vullo, which heads the department, that the state has caused ""irrecoverable loss and irreparable harm"" to the organization. But, of course, the organization is making these claims in a lawsuit, which it hopes to win. The Rolling Stone first obtained the lawsuit and published the 45-page complaint online Friday. Over several months, the NRA has taken aim at the state of New York and its financial regulators after the state ruled the NRA's insurance, ""Carry Guard,"" was illegal because it gave liability protection to gun owners for acts where there was ""intentional wrongdoing.""

""Defendants seek to silence one of America’s oldest constitutional rights advocates. If their abuses are not enjoined, they will soon, substantially, succeed."" For years, the NRA has boasted about its large membership, which it claims to be about 5 million, though actual figures have never been released. The organization in its yearly tax filings shows it rakes in an average total of about $128 million. The Washington Post notes that number has varied over the years from a $72 million in 2006 to $228 million the following year. The newspaper notes the number of members appear to spike after a mass shooting. If true, one would think the back-to-back shootings in Florida, Texas, Nevada and Tennessee would have helped bolster the organization's finances.

For months, the public didn’t. Now, law enforcement officers are suing over a pistol that can fire when you drop it. When gun manufacturer Sig Sauer was about to land a massive deal in 2016 to supply the US Army with a new pistol, the military made a disturbing discovery during testing. If dropped at a certain angle, the gun would go off by itself. The company won the deal last year anyway, then fixed the guns before shipping them. The Army’s apparent endorsement helped make a nearly identical Sig Sauer pistol, the P320, a popular choice for police departments and the general public. But for several months, the company sold its commercial version of the gun without the fix it had made for the military, a CNN investigation has found. Over the past two years, three law enforcement officers say they have suffered gunshot injuries when their P320s fired after being dropped or jostled, according to lawsuits and police department documents obtained by CNN Investigates. One sheriff’s deputy in Virginia had her femur shattered when the gun went off as she removed the holstered pistol, according to a lawsuit she filed against Sig Sauer in April, and she has been told she may never walk normally again. At least six other P320 users have had their guns go off accidentally as well. As the gun community started to circulate word of the problem, Sig Sauer announced a “voluntary upgrade” program in August 2017, allowing P320 owners to ship their guns to the company for a free fix to guard against the “rare occurrence” of accidental discharge in a drop. But its website insists that the unrepaired gun “meets and exceeds all US safety standards,” and the company has not issued a recall. Sig Sauer is facing lawsuits over its P320 gun, after several people were allegedly shot when it fired without a trigger pull. CNN’s Martin Savidge reports. Play video “They had knowledge of defects with this weapon before my client was shot. The trigger was too heavy. It was fixed on the military version. They got the half-billion-dollar contract. But the commercial version was left alone,” said Jeff Bagnell, the lawyer for the Virginia deputy. Despite CNN’s repeated requests over several weeks, Sig Sauer would not respond to questions. Company spokesman Joel Harris initially said CEO Ron Cohen was traveling and unavailable. Executives later ignored emails, phone calls, and LinkedIn messages. A lawyer representing Sig Sauer in court refused to comment last week, citing pending litigation. The upgraded P320 is now what Sig Sauer ships to stores. But more than 500,000 pistols were sold before Sig Sauer acknowledged the problem publicly, according to company statements to several gun trade publications. Today, numerous unrepaired P320s remain on the streets and are available for purchase, both new and secondhand. CNN called large and small gun shops in 20 states in early May. The older version of the P320 pistol was still on store shelves in 11 of the 40 gun shops we reached. And a CNN review of private seller postings in early May on Armslist.com, an online marketplace for guns, found that at least 162 of the 400 models being sold there since March were the problematic older version — easily identified by its thick trigger. Of the sellers online, only four warned potential buyers about the problem. Three sellers displayed unrepaired guns, yet claimed they had been upgraded. Another seller photographed the gun with the ammunition magazine laid over the trigger area, leaving the prospective buyer guessing whether the gun was upgraded or not. Source: Sig Sauer Inc. Graphic: Tal Yellin/CNN The gun they’re selling is one that its manufacturer maintains is safe. But the company’s coveted deal to supply the Army with an almost identical model — a contract worth up to $580 million — depends on guns that got the fix. That contract is a badge of honor that the company’s sales representatives used to convince police chiefs and city councils all over the country of the gun’s safety and reliability. “That’s used as a selling point: If it’s good enough for the US Army, it’s good enough for the police department,” said Matthew Griffin, a former captain with the Army Rangers who spent years as a contractor providing gear to military special operations teams. “But they were knowingly putting our officers in danger. There has to be some degree of culpability.” Unintended discharges The problem affecting the original P320 is what the gun industry calls an “unintended discharge,” or as one lawsuit against Sig Sauer explains: “The weapon fires without a trigger pull.” Firearms experts say these types of malfunctions — even when guns are dropped — are exceedingly rare. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data from 27 states in 2015, it found that 193 people were killed “due to unintentional firearm-related injuries”; a “dropped gun” was to blame for 12 of those deaths. CNN is not aware of any deaths due to malfunctioning P320s, but at least three people have allegedly been injured. On January 5, 2017, Stamford Police Department SWAT team member Vincent A. Sheperis was loading tactical gear into his hatchback car’s trunk when he dropped his holstered P320 pistol, he claims. The gun went off on its own, and the bullet tore through his left knee behind the patella, according to a lawsuit he filed against Sig Sauer. “The bullet could easily have taken his life,” says the lawsuit, filed in Connecticut federal court seven months later. “At no time before, during or after the incident did Officer Sheperis place his finger on the P320’s trigger or touch the holstered firearm in any manner.” This 9 mm bullet allegedly tore through the left knee of Vincent Sheperis, a SWAT officer in Stamford, Connecticut. His P320 fired when he dropped it, he claims. Credit: Courtesy of Jeff Bagnell Five days after that incident, Stamford police officers traveled to Sig Sauer’s service center in New Hampshire to have them inspect the weapon. CNN viewed video footage of the visit, during which two company employees took the gun apart and inspected it as the Stamford department’s then in-house firearms expert, Sgt. Tom Wolff, described what had happened. Sig Sauer has since fought back against Sheperis’ lawsuit in federal court. In court documents, the company acknowledged that it was notified, calling it “the first alleged drop fire incident involving a P320 that SIG Sauer was made aware of.” But among other claims, the company argues Sheperis can’t claim a “breach of contract” because he didn’t buy the pistol — the police department did. Sig Sauer also says it has done enough to warn consumers with its voluntary upgrade program. “Sig denies any allegations that suggest that the P320 model pistol was subject to a recall or is otherwise defective,” the company responded in a court filing. Another incident happened on the windy night of October 1, 2017, in the small city of Riverdale, Georgia, when another cop narrowly missed injuring himself. Sgt. Derrick Broughton and two other officers were responding to a “suspicious person” call at a suburban home when he slipped on a cement block and fell — setting off his holstered P320. No one was hurt. Back at the precinct, Broughton found a spent round inside the chamber of his gun, according to Riverdale Police Department emails obtained by CNN. “In light of this incident, I believe that it may be in the best interest of the City of Riverdale Police Department to have the Sig Sauer P320 removed from service ASAP,” reads a letter from a city employee to a police captain. The city decided to keep them. It was the only incident of its kind since the department purchased the pistols two years earlier, Riverdale Police Chief Todd Spivey told CNN. Instead, five months after the officer’s experience, the department took up Sig Sauer’s offer to “upgrade” the weapons. Marcie D. Vadnais is a sheriff’s deputy in Loudoun County, Virginia.

Vadnais was merely removing her holstered pistol when the gun went off on its own, sending a 9 mm bullet into her upper right thigh and shattering her femur bone in half, she claims. The Loudoun County, Virginia, law enforcement officer is now taking daily painkillers and recovering from an injury that may prevent her from ever walking normally again, according to a lawsuit she filed in federal court. The Loudoun Sheriff’s Department would not make Vadnais available to CNN for comment. In an email, a department spokesman wrote that Sig Sauer had contacted them in August 2017 and offered replacements — but he specified that the company was addressing reports “that dropping the firearm may cause an unintentional discharge.” No other risks were cited by the company, and the sheriff’s office now points to a Sig Sauer press release at the time that assured that “the P320 meets U.S. standards for safety.” The department is now replacing its Sig pistols with the upgraded models. Sig Sauer has not yet responded in court papers to the deputy’s lawsuit, which was refiled in Virginia last month. The bullet that entered Deputy Vadnais’ right thigh shattered her femur in half, according to a lawsuit. She has not yet recovered.

The agency acknowledged the incident to CNN but would not provide details, citing an ongoing internal investigation. His attorney, Jason Recksiedler, told CNN the 50-year-old SWAT officer was at home when a call came in about a possible hostage situation. He ran outside and accidentally dropped his holstered pistol onto his concrete driveway. The gun went off on its own, according to Recksiedler, sending a 9 mm bullet into the officer’s left leg and shattering his tibia bone near the knee. The next day, as a safety precaution, Orlando Police Chief John W. Mina ordered all officers to submit their Sig P320s for inspection to make sure they had been upgraded. ‘Safety without compromise’ What drives the Sig Sauer P320’s popularity with police departments is, ironically, its safety features. Glocks, long the preferred pistols for American law enforcement, have one awkward quality. To clean the firearm, the user has to pull the trigger. This violates a sacred safety rule: Keep your finger off the trigger until ready to shoot. No experienced shooter would clean a loaded gun, but pulling the trigger on an empty pistol can still be a hair-raising experience. When Sig Sauer unveiled the Sig P320 model in 2014, a key selling point was that it did away with this necessity. From the trigger, to the striker and even the magazine, the P320 won't fire unless you want it to. Sig Sauer | Promotional material “Safety without compromise,” Sig Sauer promotional materials boast. “We’ve designed safety elements into every necessary feature on this pistol. From the trigger, to the striker and even the magazine, the P320 won’t fire unless you want it to.” Another attractive feature of the pistol is that it’s “modular”; users can swap out the pistol frame for different hand sizes or for concealment. Back in 2016, the police chief of a Salt Lake City suburb in Utah cited safety as the primary reason to swap out their Glocks for Sig P320s. “It is recommended that the Council approve the Police Department’s conversion to a single primary duty weapon, the Sig Sauer P320 Pistol, in order to improve officer safety while being able to maintain flexibility to fit the varying hand sizes of the officers,” then Police Chief Lee W. Russo wrote to the West Valley City council. Sig Sauer also specifically claimed that, even without a common safety feature now regularly found on pistols from Smith & Wesson and Springfield, their gun would be safe if dropped. “You won’t need a tabbed trigger safety for your gun to be drop safe,” the P320 promotional materials say. But the drop fire malfunction was exactly the problem Sig Sauer would encounter — and it was one that became known to the company months before it told the American public. Damage control When the Army put out a bid for its next-generation pistol in 2015, the weapons industry’s top manufacturers fought for a chance at a mega contract. During testing on April 20, 2016, the military says it discovered that the Sig Sauer pistol would fire on its own when dropped. The examination used a test version of ammunition, similar to a blank. A recent Department of Defense report describes what happened. “During drop testing in which an empty primed cartridge was inserted, the striker struck the primer causing a discharge,” the report says. “Sig Sauer implemented an Engineering Change Proposal (ECP) to correct this deficiency by implementing lightweight components in the trigger group mechanism.” It’s unclear when Sig Sauer made that improvement, but it was in place in time for Army testing trials in April 2017, the report says. “The [modular handgun system] with this … modification was submitted as the production-representative pistol for [product verification testing] … (T)he Army entered into PVT in April 2017.” The Army assured CNN that since that fix, “there is no drop test deficiency” with its new Sig Sauer pistol, which includes two models of different sizes that the military has dubbed the XM17 and XM18. But that timing means Sig Sauer provided a repair for the military at least four months before launching the same fix for the civilian market. CNN was unable to reach Sig Sauer to ask how many of the pre-upgrade P320s were sold to the general public. But the company told industry journalists that it sold more than 500,000 before it announced the upgrade, and before the Army put the pistol into the field. Brigadier General Tony Potts, who has overseen the US Army’s transition to its new XM17 pistol, toured Sig Sauer’s facility in Newington, New Hampshire, in February. Credit: US Army Sig Sauer received several notifications about incidents nationwide that occurred from April to August of last year, according to company disclosures made in court. Those included accidental discharges in Oregon and Texas. CNN has not been able to independently confirm these incidents. The company was also notified about an incident that occurred in Howell Township, a small suburb near the New Jersey coast. The police department there confirmed the details to CNN. On the night of June 19, 2017, a police officer inside the police station dropped his holstered pistol and it went off on its own, according to the department’s in-house armorer, Lt. Bernie Fowler. He told CNN this was “an isolated incident,” no one was injured, and “Sig did the right thing” by eventually replacing all 125 of the police force’s pistols. The Dallas Police Department in Texas, which had allowed some officers to carry Sig P320s, decided on July 28, 2017 to have “duty use… temporarily suspended due to safety precautions,” according to a spokesman. The Dallas department declined to comment further. News of the decision leaked to firearm blogs. Sig Sauer remained publicly silent through the summer, even as rumors spread through the American gun community. But, after the Dallas decision, the company moved to defend its product. On August 4, 2017, the company’s CEO, Ron Cohen, issued a statement to gun trade publications in which he said: “There have been zero (0) reported drop-related P320 incidents in the U.S. commercial market, with hundreds of thousands of guns delivered to date.” It’s not clear whether Sig Sauer considers law enforcement sales part of that market. Three days after that statement, Omaha Outdoors, an online gun store that publishes popular product reviews, published a written and video report exploring the issue. Andrew Tuohy, an Iraq War veteran and firearms expert, tested four P320s on video for the accidental “drop fire” problem. Three of them, when dropped at a certain angle, went off more than half the time, Tuohy told CNN. The fourth had a lighter trigger and never went off when dropped. But even when the pistols with the heavier trigger didn’t accidentally fire, there was still evidence they nearly did, Tuohy told CNN. In every case, Tuohy said, he found marks on the back of the ammunition that showed the gun had tapped the primer, the part of a cartridge that goes bang and initiates the explosion needed to send the bullet flying out of the gun. Testers at Omaha Outdoors concluded the pistol’s factory-installed trigger was so heavy that when the pistol was dropped on its back with the barrel facing up, the inertia of the fall caused the trigger to pull. “We found this result was consistent across calibers, frame sizes, and even different types of ammunition,” Tuohy says in the YouTube video he published on August 7. “All of these, when dropped at the right angle, would result in uncommanded firing of the pistol.” In a video posted on Aug. 7, 2017, gun store Omaha Outdoors found that P320s with the heavier trigger could fire when dropped at a certain angle. Source: Omaha Outdoors That video prompted the Houston Police Department to conduct testing of its own. Sgt. Robert Sandoval, the department’s firearms instructor, told CNN he dropped a P320 pistol 30 times in three different ways. It went off four times, he said. The chief was alerted. Officers were warned immediately. On August 8, Sig Sauer publicly launched its “P320 voluntary upgrade program.” It let gun owners send in their pistol for a fix – free of charge. The offer never calls it a repair, merely an optional “upgrade” or “update” to make the gun “enhanced.” So far, the gun maker has refused to issue a recall of the P320 pistol, which would acknowledge the dangers of the pistol and warn users to stop using it until it receives repairs. (It has, by way of comparison, issued a recall for rifles with faulty triggers.) And there is no US government agency that can force its hand. Guns are the only product that, if defective, cannot be recalled by the government, because of a special carve-out in the law that established the Consumer Product Safety Commission in 1972. Firearms enthusiasts and the National Rifle Association have pushed back against a change in the law, citing concerns that government-mandated gun recalls could be used as a means to confiscate guns and violate the spirit of the Second Amendment. But the pro-gun crowd does look for safety in their weapons, and expects a sense of corporate responsibility. In 2016, a decade-long effort by individual gun owners resulted in a historic class-action settlement with another company, Remington, for selling a popular hunting rifle with a defective trigger. Under intense public pressure and after several documented deaths, Remington launched a “voluntary recall” and offered to replace the triggers. The company still denies wrongdoing. Police business Sig Sauer earned the business of several police departments across the country while selling the pre-upgrade version of the pistol. Last year, before acknowledging a fix was available, the company announced deals with the Santa Barbara County Sheriff’s Office in California and the North Dakota Highway Patrol. CNN contacted more than a dozen law enforcement agencies that have ordered the P320. All of them have sent in their pistols for an upgrade or are currently in the process of doing so. Nearly all of them said they were satisfied with the weapon’s performance and the company’s conduct. Sig Sauer covers the cost of all repairs and shipping. High Point Police Department in North Carolina, one of the first to adopt the weapon back in December 2014, has replaced all 265 pistols with the upgraded version. Pasco County Sheriff’s Office in Florida is in the midst of sending hundreds of P320s for repair. The Alhambra Police Department in California is currently switching to the P320 and expects to receive the fixed version. The Cambridge Police Department in Massachusetts chose to wait for Sig Sauer to release its fixed version, and it will be transitioning to the P320 this fall. None of the departments have experienced any accidental discharges, and all of them assert this purchase was the right decision. The Hawaii Department of Public Safety, similarly, claims it has “not experienced any malfunction issues” since it adopted the pistol in 2016. “The Sig P320 is a superb firearm that [we] will continue to utilize as our cross operational primary duty weapon for many years to come.” Still, that department told CNN it made sure to replace all P320s with the newer version. If they knew about this problem ahead of time, before they shipped these pistols, that's egregious. James Callaway | Police chief in Morrow, Georgia One police chief in Morrow, Georgia, told CNN he initially appreciated how Sig Sauer handled the issue. Police Chief James Callaway saw the Army’s contract as a blessing of the gun’s safety. He went out and bought 37 of them soon after, in March 2017. “It’s been tested and tested with them. You’d think that, with the US Army signing a contract, the federal government thinks it’s a good enough weapon,” Callaway told CNN he reasoned. Besides, this was the latest pistol from a gun maker with prestigious European origins and a long history of reliability and quality. “I saw this as something I could offer as a benefit to my officers. We don’t get paid much. A Glock is a Ford. A Sig is kind of like a Mercedes, something we can’t afford. I was really happy to give a higher-end labeled weapon to my officers to protect themselves.” Then, on August 10 last year, he saw the Omaha Outdoors video documenting the Sig P320’s tendency to fire when dropped. Concerned about the safety of his officers, Callaway pulled out his checkbook and wrote a $13,906 check to a nearby gun shop, buying a Glock to replace every officer’s Sig pistol. He felt the drop fire hazard was too real to wait around. An accidental drop “happens more often than you might think. We’re just people. Sometimes you’re getting dressed, and you’re fumbling around. I wouldn’t want one of my officers getting shot,” he told CNN. He had Sig Sauer service the original pistols, which they did for free, and six months later, the department was back to using its P320s. Morrow Police Chief James Callaway immediately replaced his officers’ P320s when he heard about the flaw. Credit: John Mcafee/CNN Callaway initially told CNN he was satisfied with Sig Sauer’s responsiveness. “They conducted themselves well. I notified them of my demand they fix these weapons, and they complied within six months, which is pretty reasonable,” he said. But when Callaway was told that Sig pistols had shown the drop fire malfunction in mid-2016 during testing for the Army, and had fixed those guns by April 2017, he was aghast. On the phone, Callaway could barely contain his anger. “So why wouldn’t they send us the right ones ahead of time?” he asked. “If they knew about this problem ahead of time, before they shipped these pistols, that’s egregious.”",SIG Sauer P320 SIG SAUER CNN Pistol Light Trigger 9×19mm Parabellum Gun SIG Sauer P365 Firearm,A Sig Sauer P320.,"Trigger warning The Army got upgraded guns.

The video confirmed Bush's presence, Rogers said. The church is headed by a black pastor and has a large African-American membership. Bush ""appeared to try to gain access to the church,"" Rogers said. Get Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox The information came as news media outlets reported that Bush made a racial comment after the deadly shooting at a Kroger in Jeffersontown, a city of about 26,600 people on the outskirts of Louisville. Rogers said it was too soon, however, to say whether the shooting was racially motivated. ""I can't speculate on motive at this time,"" the chief said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are pursuing all avenues of the investigation no matter where that takes us or what it involves."" The FBI announced it ""is evaluating the evidence to determine if there were any violations of federal law."" Hate crimes are prosecuted under federal law. More than 100 people gathered outside Kroger store Thursday night to pay tribute to the victims, reports CBS Louisville affiliate WLKY-TV. Scene from vigil on October 25, 2018 for two victims of fatal shooting at Korger grocery store in Jeffersontown, Kentucky the day before WLKY-TV Friends and family members of the victims told the station they found comfort in the gathering. ""This helped to renew my faith in human kindness -- this movement, this beautiful thing,"" said Kevin Gunn, the nephew of one of them. Chief Rogers said Bush apparently does have a history of mental illness, as news outlets have reported. An arrest report says Bush walked into the Kroger, pulled a gun from his waist and shot a man in the back of the head, then kept shooting him multiple times ""as he was down on the floor."" The report says Bush then reholstered his gun, walked outside and killed a woman in the parking lot. Each victim died of multiple gunshot wounds, Rogers said. A man carrying a concealed weapon who happened to be in the parking lot challenged Bush, and police say the suspect then ""began firing wildly"" at him, putting other shoppers in the parking lot in danger. Neither man was hurt in that confrontation, Rogers said. Bystander video shows a white man in a distinctive neon-yellow shirt trying to drive away while an officer chases after him on foot. Many more officers converged on the scene and made the arrest just a few hundred yards from the store Wednesday afternoon. Bush was jailed on $5 million bond Thursday on two counts of murder and 10 counts of felony wanton endangerment. Ed Harrell was quoted by the Courier Journal of Louisville as saying he was waiting for his wife in the parking lot when he heard gunshots and grabbed his revolver. As he crouched down, he said he saw the gunman walk ""nonchalantly"" by with a gun by his side. Harrell said he called out to ask what was going on, and the gunman replied: ""Don't shoot me. I won't shoot you. Whites don't shoot whites."" Rogers said police ""are aware of that statement and are evaluating any factors that may come into play with"" it. He said he had ""no direct knowledge"" of whether there was more than one armed bystander at the scene. The local coroner's office identified the victims as Maurice Stallard, 69, and Vicki Lee Jones, 67. Police said there didn't appear to be any connection between Bush and the victims, or any link between Bush and the Kroger store. Stallard's 12-year-old grandson was shopping with him in the store when he was gunned down, Jeffersontown Mayor Bill Dieruf said Thursday. The boy was physically unharmed, but most certainly traumatized, the mayor said, adding, ""He was there and cannot unsee what he has seen."" Stallard was the father of Kellie Watson, the chief racial equity officer for Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer. The mayor shared his outrage Thursday over what he called an ""epidemic of gun violence"" that ""hit close to home."" ""People getting shot at a grocery store, a school, outside a church. Can't we all agree that that is unacceptable?"" said Fischer, a Democrat running for re-election. Authorities removed computers and cellphones from the house where Bush lived with his parents. Bush's criminal record shows he threatened his ex-wife and punched a deputy sheriff during a family court hearing years ago. He also was charged with assaulting his elderly parents in January 2009. An arrest citation said Bush's parents were punched and choked, and they told police they were ""terrified of (his) unpredictable behavior.""",Maurice Stallard Jeffersontown Kroger shooting Jeffersontown  Suspect Kroger  Hate crime Louisville Shooting,"A police photo of the suspect, Gregory Bush, in a photo released by the Jeffersontown Police Department.","JEFFERSONTOWN, Ky. -- A white man with a history of violence and mental illness was recorded on surveillance video apparently trying to get inside a predominantly black church in Kentucky before he went to a grocery store and fatally shot two African-Americans, police said After releasing a photo of the suspect, authorities received a tip from an employee of the city of Jeffersontown who said he thought he saw Gregory Bush outside the First Baptist church prior to Wednesday's shooting, city police chief Sam Rogers said.

The meeting between US President Donald Trump and the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) trade group comes less than a month after a teenaged gunman bearing a semi-automatic weapon shot dead 17 people at his former Florida high school. In the aftermath of the attack Trump pointed to video games as a possible contributing factor to the firearms violence plaguing the nation. ""We have to look at the internet because a lot of bad things are happening to young kids and young minds and their minds are being formed,"" the Republican leader said. ""And also video games. I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts."" But the ESA says gaming is ""plainly"" not at fault, wielding data showing no established link between games and violence in the flesh. ""Like all Americans, we are deeply concerned about the level of gun violence in the United States,"" the ESA said in response to an AFP inquiry about the upcoming White House meeting. ""Video games are plainly not the issue: entertainment is distributed and consumed globally, but the US has an exponentially higher level of gun violence than any other nation."" Video games are calculated to be a $100 billion a year global business by market intelligence firm NewZoo. - White House rematch - Thursday's meeting comes five years after Joe Biden, then vice president, met with the ESA, heads of major video game companies, and researchers as the nation grappled with Connecticut's Sandy Hook massacre that saw 20 primary school-age children gunned down. Following that shooting the National Rifle Association singled out video games as the true danger to society. ""There exists in this country a callous, corrupt and corrupting shadow industry that sells, and sows violence against its own people,"" said the NRA's Wayne LaPierre, blaming ""vicious violent video games"" as well as ""bloodsoaked films."" But gaming industry veteran Mark DeLoura -- who attended the Biden meeting and later spent two years as a White House senior adviser for digital media -- said that ""if anything, it seems like it has gotten clearer there is no correlation."" ""All of our research related to games is there, Trump would just have to ask for it,"" he said. ""That makes me mad; one administration should learn from another."" Both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) have taken a stance in recent years against children and teens playing violent video games. But a rising number of academics question the evidence of a link between gaming and aggression, and more than 200 scholars joined to speak out against an APA report affirming such a connection. - 'Gut-feelings' vs 'facts' - It is not the first time video games have come under scrutiny: a high-profile 1993 congressional hearing spearheaded by Democratic senators targeted games including ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Night Trap"" for violent play, with some lawmakers saying the games encouraged or desensitized minors to brutality and bloodshed. A later effort by California officials to ban sales of violent video games to children was struck down by the US Supreme Court in 2011 on the grounds that, like books and films, games are protected by constitutional rights to free speech. DeLoura said blaming video games that feature brutal play might stem from the ""gut-feelings"" of adults watching children engage in virtual battles, rather than hard data. ""What's causing shootings is guns are so accessible that when you have an impulse, you can act on it,"" he said. ""Does it have to be more complicated than that?"" With a gun culture that runs deep, America is deadlocked over how to stem the scourge of mass shootings. But video games, the industry holds, are innocent. ""Blaming video games for violence in the real world is no more productive than blaming the news media for bringing violent crimes into our homes night after night,"" the ESA says on its website. Video game play is booming as spectator sport, with fans flocking to arenas for tournaments as well as watching matches online. The association notably cites data trends showing that violent crime, particularly by young people, has declined in the US since the early 1990s -- even as video games have flourished. ""The rise of this conversation again isn't about facts, it isn't about research,"" said DeLoura in a recent blog post.

1,1,10073,https://www.yahoo.com/news/florida-shooter-troubled-loner-white-supremacist-ties-213321497.html,Florida shooter a troubled loner with white supremacist ties,"Parkland (Etats-Unis) (AFP) - Nikolas Cruz was expelled from school, threatened fellow students and posted ""very disturbing"" messages on social media, along with pictures of his favorite guns. But despite broad signs suggesting he was a deeply troubled young man, Cruz was able to return to his Parkland, Florida high school Wednesday with an assault rifle and open fire, killing 17 students and adults. A mugshot of Cruz, released after his arrest, depicts a young man seemingly little different from any other 19-year-old -- cleanly-cut chestnut hair, hazel eyes, his face speckled with freckles. But the information emerging since his attack suggests there were red flags that should have set off danger alerts. Fellow students knew he posted violent messages on line. And someone using the same name had published a comment on YouTube last year saying: ""I'm going to be a professional school shooter."" That was reported to the FBI, but they never traced it back to Cruz. Cruz had also joined the white supremacist group Republic of Florida, participating in their paramilitary training exercises, a member of the group told US media. And Broward County Mayor Beam Furr said he had been treated for a time at a mental health clinic, though he had not been back for over a year. - 'A lot of problems' - Cruz arrived Wednesday afternoon at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in a sprawling Florida suburb north of Miami just before school let out, opening fire with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle originally designed for combat. Before he was expelled last year, he had a reputation among the 3,000-strong student body as ""weird"" and ""threatening,"" according to students and teachers. ""I met him last year, he was in my class at the beginning of the year and when I first met him I knew that something was off about him and he was kind of weird,"" Manolo Alvarez, 17, told AFP. ""People would bully him once in a while and spread rumors about him, like he was planning a school shooting, and nobody believed it. We thought it was just rumors until sadly it actually happened,"" Alvarez said. Story continues Dakota Mutchler, 17, told the Washington Post he began selling knives in school out of his lunchbox, and posted on Instagram about his guns and about killing animals. His interest in guns wouldn't have been extraordinary. He had been a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps, a government high school program that provides preparatory training for the military, including marksmanship. But his behavior eventually gave rise to strong concerns from the school administration. According to another pupil, Nicholas Coke, Cruz had ""a lot of problems,"" recalling an incident during middle school when Cruz kicked out a window. - 'They didn't see this coming ' - Jim Gard, a math teacher who had taught Cruz for a semester in 2016, told the Miami Herald that teachers were notified he had been expelled, and could not be permitted back on school grounds with a backpack. ""There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus."" He clearly had a difficult childhood. Cruz was given up for adoption at birth in September 1998, along with a brother. The adoptive parents were a couple in their 50s, according to the Sun Sentinel, the local newspaper. His father died when he was still young, while his mother passed away last November, leaving the boys in the care of a family friend, according to the Sentinel. Neighbors said he got in trouble repeatedly for minor incidents as he grew up, and that police were called a number of times, the Sentinel reported. One said he was seen shooting another neighbor's chickens. When he moved in with another family after his mother died, they kept his legally owned AR-15 locked in a cabinet, though Cruz had a key, according to Jim Lewis, the family's attorney.

708,708,10862,http://us.cnn.com/2018/03/27/politics/repealing-the-second-amendment/index.html,There's not a 'snowflake's chance in hell' of repealing the Second Amendment,"(CNN) How could those high school kids have marched en masse and not achieved any meaningful reform? That seems to be the state of affairs: The gun laws seem intractably set, despite growing public support to change them, at least on the periphery of the laws. Measures passed in Florida after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting seem to have no prospects at the national level. But former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is not talking about frittering around the edges of anything. He issued a modest proposal in The New York Times to get rid of the Second Amendment altogether. Repeal it, he says Stevens argued that a right to bear arms, which the Supreme Court has said the Second Amendment guarantees, should mean something different in the era of today's weapons and today's civil society, and, in the spirit of many gun-control advocates, pointed out the Second Amendment is talking about militias when it brings up ""arms."" The entire text of the Second Amendment, remember, is this: ""A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."" Stevens has railed in the past about how far we've gotten from the idea of militias in the interpretation of the Second Amendment -- and he channels that view in the op-ed. ""Concern that a national standing army might pose a threat to the security of the separate states led to the adoption of that amendment, which provides that 'a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed,'"" he writes in the Times. ""Today that concern is a relic of the 18th century."" He then launches into a Supreme Court history lesson on how gun laws evolved from 1789 to a unanimous decision against sawed-off shotguns in 1939 because they weren't appropriate for use in a ""well-regulated militia"" -- through the landmark 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller that threw the whole idea of a well-regulated militia out the window. That case changed the interpretation of the Second Amendment's clause concerning guns to be an individual right for self-defense. Antonin Scalia's majority opinion in the case, by the way, is a marvel of grammatical gymntastics , that decides the amendment is not about the well-regulated militia discussed in the text, but rather that ""it surely elevates above all other interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home."" Stevens was appointed by Republican President Gerald Ford, but he often sided with the more liberal wing of the court during his tenure and he resigned during the Obama administration, resulting in Elena Kagan being confirmed to take his spot on the bench. So he's bringing a more liberal mindset to this issue. It's also unlikely to happen. Probably ever. Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and Second Amendment expert who supports gun control, was tweeting Tuesday about Stevens' piece, and said, ""there's not a snowflake's chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment any time soon."" Of course all this overlooks the obvious problem: There's not a snowflakes chance in hell we are going to repeal the Second Amendment anytime soon. — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 ""We can't even get Congress to pass a law banning bump stocks,"" Winkler wrote. ""We can't get Congress to mandate universal background checks. And Stevens thinks 2/3s of Congress will vote to repeal the 2A? And 3/4 of the states will ratify such an amendment? Nonsense."" But it's still worth examining whether repealing the Second Amendment is actually that what people want. There is, indeed, great support for tighter gun laws -- seven in 10 Americans said in a CNN poll after the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting that they'd support new gun restrictions. That's the highest such support in 25 years. But on more specific proposals that could be seen as limiting gun rights, there were very partisan divides. A ban on semi-automatic weapons, for instance, had the support of 80% of Democrats and 53% of independents, but just 34% of Republicans, for instance. The idea of limiting the number of guns an individual can own garners 69% support among Democrats vs. just 23% among Republicans, according to that CNN poll. It's hard to find any recent reliable polling on the larger idea of repealing the amendment completely, but if there are sharp divides on specific efforts to curb gun rights, it's a good bet that an entire repeal would be even more controversial. A minority of American households have guns -- 30%, according to a Pew survey in 2017, with 16% of Democrats and 41% of Republicans owning guns. It's important here to say that Stevens did not say in his op-ed that guns should be taken away from anyone who has them, just that the Second Amendment should be repealed. What would be left to regulate the many millions of guns already in the country? That would have to be figured out. But you can hear the slogan opponents would use against an effort like Stevens' proposal: They're trying to take your guns away! In fact, that's a slogan President Donald Trump used effectively against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton in 2016 (and since then), accusing her of wanting to ""take your guns away"" even though Clinton said she was a supporter of Second Amendment rights. JUST WATCHED Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: 'Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away' 01:13 Winkler also argued that Stevens' proposal is counterproductive because it backs up the claim by Trump and the NRA that supporters of gun control want to take away guns. ""Stevens's call to repeal the 2A is not only ineffective but worse: it makes it even harder to pass good gun laws today. It plays right into the hands of the @nra which can now point to this op-ed and say, 'See, we told you they want to take away your rights and your guns.'"" Current Democratic leaders, even as they have pushed for new gun control, have made clear they support the Second Amendment. If national elections are going to be won and lost in the Rust Belt, Democrats will need support from gun rights supporters if they're going to win congressional or presidential elections. ""I believe in the Second Amendment, there's a right to bear arms,"" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in February. ""Every law-abiding citizen has the right to have a gun unless you're a felon, or you're adjudicated mentally ill, everyone agrees to that."" Even if Democrats turned wholesale against the Second Amendment (and gave up any claim they had on moderates and gun lovers in their party), there's the not-so-small difficulty of actually changing the Constitution. The Constitution has been amended 27 times in US history, including the original 10 amendments in the Bill of Rights, which includes the Second Amendment. The last amendment ratified was the 27th in 1992, which made it so Congress can't raise its own wages until the following Congress. That took decades to pass. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin and CNN contributor, said it's not impossible to repeal the Second Amendment, but perhaps Stevens was trying to reframe the arguments. ""I wonder if Justice Stevens was trying to take a step back from the politics of the moment to situate the debate in a broader context,"" he said, although he pointed out that changes to the Constitution have been few and far between. ""There have only been 17 amendments in 231 years, and most of those have been about the structure of government/elections/voting, not substantive rights. It's really quite difficult to get an amendment through, especially on a divisive question of social policy,"" Vladeck said. None of the original 10 amendments has ever been repealed or changed, so you're well into uncharted territory with Stevens' idea. The only amendment which really took something away from citizens was the 18th Amendment, which was enacted in 1920 and made alcohol illegal on the national level. And maybe the precedent for what Stevens proposes is the 21st Amendment, by which the 18th Amendment was repealed 13 years later. It takes an amendment to repeal an amendment. Article V of the Constitution lays out that process, which requires supermajorities in Congress and of state legislatures and/or constitutional conventions. So politically and procedurally, Stevens' idea is a conversation-starter (and maybe a much-needed conversation-starter), but not much else. Repealing the Second Amendment isn't likely to happen any time soon. To say the least. But Stevens doesn't seem to be worried about those details. He's making a broader point about the court and guns. Later in his piece, Stevens suggests the entire aim of getting rid of the Second Amendment would be to overturn that decision in Heller, which made gun ownership an individual right. ""Overturning that decision via a constitutional amendment to get rid of the Second Amendment would be simple and would do more to weaken the NRA's ability to stymie legislative debate and block constructive gun control legislation than any other available option,"" he writes. I agree! We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the 2A, gun control proponents need to mobilize politically. That seems to be happening now. https://t.co/IS1cYJuWwT — Adam Winkler (@adamwinkler) March 27, 2018 Winkler said marchers and other activists should stay the course they are on. ""We are seeing a real transformation of the gun control advocacy movement. It's finally starting to look like a movement. Instead of repealing the (Second Amendment), gun control proponents need to mobilize politically,"" he wrote. Vladeck argued there is plenty of gun control legislation that can be achieved under the current structure and he pointed to a Maryland assault weapons case as proof. ""So we may not need either a different Supreme Court or a constitutional amendment to achieve most of what reformers are seeking; we just need folks to realize that the principal objections to many of these proposals are political, not constitutional,"" Vladeck said.","Gun Remington Arms Remington Outdoor Company Inc.

Why man says he's fighting to be allowed to post blueprints for 3-D printed guns Why man says he's fighting to be allowed to post blueprints for 3-D printed guns ABC News Cody Wilson has been called “one of the most dangerous people on the Internet.” For years, Wilson has fought to make sure anyone should be able to download the files to make a gun at home with the click of a button using a 3-D printer or a computer automated milling machine. “I’ve demonstrated ... especially these last few weeks [that] the idea of gun control in the internet age is inoperable,” Wilson told ABC News’ “Nightline.” Last week, a federal judge temporarily stopped him from putting gun blueprints online -- the latest chapter in an ongoing battle with the federal government, 19 states, the District of Columbia and gun control advocates. “If Cody Wilson is not stopped, then what we will find is a universe where the internet has plans to 3-D print any kind of weapon anybody wants, with printers that make that incredibly easy for someone to do in only a few hours in their garage or in their living room,” Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign, told “Nightline.” Cody Wilson, owner of Defense Distributed company, holds a 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" in his factory in Austin, Texas, Aug.1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Wilson invited “Nightline” to Austin, Texas, which is the home of his company Defense Distributed. The 30-year-old said he originally wanted to be a lawyer. “I had a better idea,” Wilson said. His idea was, “Could you make WikiLeaks for guns?” In 2012, he and his friends were some of the first people to 3-D print a plastic gun, which they called “The Liberator.” They shared the blueprint file on the internet, where Wilson says it was downloaded more than 100,000 times in just the first week. That’s when the federal government jumped. The State Department argued that by posting the blueprints, Wilson was basically doing the same thing as exporting weapons abroad. Wilson took down the blueprints, and in 2015 filed a lawsuit against the State Department arguing that the digital gun blueprints are a form of free speech. Wilson says it’s both a First Amendment issue and a Second Amendment issue. “It’s both, but the way that this had to be fought for years in court was on a First Amendment claim,” Wilson said. A 3D printed gun, called the ""Liberator,"" is seen in a factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images Andy Greenberg, a senior writer at WIRED, has covered Wilson and the digital DIY gun debate since 2012. “If a gun is a piece of data then are you allowed to share it and call it free speech? That is the argument that Defense Distributed has been making for the last three years,” Greenberg told “Nightline.” “All the headlines are always about 3-D printed guns. But for Defense Distributed 3-D printing is almost just like a stand-in for this idea of any kind of digital tool that allows you to with just a download and a click create a gun component at home,” said Greenberg. In a surprise turn this summer, the Trump administration reached a settlement with Wilson and Defense Distributed that would have allowed him to publish his gun blueprints online. He started publishing some of the files on July 27 but was forced again to remove them when a judge issued a temporary restraining order last week. Wilson says that his aim is less about making weapons but instead giving people the tools to make a gun. “Posting guns to the internet my goodness in these terms knowing the attorneys general will sue, nothing beats it,"" Wilson said. At his company’s Texas headquarters, Wilson showed how his company has moved beyond the 3D printing of plastic guns into making metal guns using a computer-automated milling machine. Wilson has developed a computer-automated milling machine, which is small enough to sit on a desk, and it costs just $2,000. It carves metal parts into the main component of different firearms like the AR-15 and glock. “This will take you a couple of hours, and it doesn’t require your constant intercession,” Wilson explained, while the machine milled part of an AR-15. It’s perfectly legal. Instead of publishing the computer data needed to operate the milling machine, Wilson ships it to his customers Unlike the plastic versions that sometimes malfunctioned, experts say the metal versions can be similar to what you buy at a gun store. Greenberg said the milling machine is “the most practical technology right now for homemade guns that circumvent all gun control laws and present a much more practical threat than 3-D printing.” Weapons like these have been called “ghost guns,” as they have no serial number, can be assembled at home and are virtually untraceable. “The term ghost gun refers to guns that really appear out of nowhere,"" Gardiner said. ""We don’t have any register of who bought them, how they were sold."" J.C. Cotter installs an electronic package for a Ghost Gunner milling machine at the Defense Distributed factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 1, 2018. Kelly West/AFP/Getty Images But homemade guns are not new, and in many cases perfectly legal. But critics say Wilson’s machine could make it easier for these firearms to get into the hands of people who aren’t legally allowed to own guns, like felons or the mentally ill. “We have seen ghost guns used in shootings around America in the last several years,” said Gardiner. Leticia Franco still remembers the day five years ago when a gunman opened fire in Santa Monica, killing four five people, including Franco’s father and sister. “You feel so sad, like a part of you is taken away,” Franco told “Nightline.” The shooter had used a ghost gun. An investigation revealed that he had a history of mental health issues, and previously had tried to buy a gun, but was denied. The shooter instead ordered parts online, and assembled them into a gun himself. This incident was not at all connected to Wilson, but Franco says she’s afraid of what Wilson’s doing. “Providing this information is wrong. He’s also ethically responsible for what other people do with this information,” Franco said. “You provided these people with information that could potentially cause another tragedy.” Wilson says he is aware of the potential dangers of making access to ghost guns easier. “This isn’t just like playing games on your keyboard, right, on the internet? I’ve had customers arrested, right, in other states for owning guns when they shouldn’t have,” Wilson said. “But, again, [I’m advocating] that these are the necessary consequences of ensuring the people’s right to keep and bear arms.” Wilson continued, “I reserve the right to change my mind about it, right? Maybe somehow it would deeply affect me, and I would choose to discontinue the operation ... I don’t know. I’m a full human being.” For now, Wilson is stuck waiting to find out if the courts will allow him to upload those gun blueprints, despite the fact that other websites already have posted the exact files that Defense Distributed was hosting on its own site, according to Greenberg. “The government has, essentially, failed, even though they tried this legal approach, they have failed to censor this information. It’s getting out there,” Greenberg explained. In the meantime, Wilson is continuing business, shipping out those milling machines, of which he said he’s sold a thousand so far this year. Despite all the legal battles ahead, Wilson says he refuses to back down. “A gun is power and this is the essence of this project… I'm actually giving people the means to create a power for themselves and I'm zealous to do that. That's real for me” he said. “People can misuse it, but it's power all the same.

It's the latest mass action since the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that claimed seventeen lives and galvanized young people to act in the long-stalled debate over guns. Some activists are heartened by the attention being paid to the issue but they raise questions about how these students get viewed versus the treatment of their peers in the Black Lives Matter movement. I spoke to one of those activists, Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement. Cullors, a New York Times best selling author, also spoke about gender dynamics as it relates to violence and her connection with another activist, Richard Edmond Vargas, whose work in a California prison is the subject of a CNN documentary called The Feminist on Cellblock Y , now streaming on CNNgo. Our conversation, edited slightly for flow and length, is below: Emma Lacey-Bordeaux: What's missing from this current conversation we're having about the gun violence? Patrisse Cullors: It's been really incredible to witness. The interventions, the narrative interventions that have been made over the last couple of weeks. And the relationship to, which people get to become victims and which people get to become heroes. We've seen black folks be on the front line, fighting for better gun laws and yes, our issues have not been amplified, even though we have been disproportionately impacted by gun violence. While I'm so, so glad the Parkland students had the support that they deserve, we can't deny, uh, that the conversation on gun violence isn't incredibly racialized. Lacey-Bordeaux: How does that make you feel? Cullors: It's frustrating, and it's enraging, and it's clarifying, because it's important as organizers that we're able to articulate why racism permeates every single fight that we're in, especially when we're trying to fight for our lives. Lacey-Bordeaux: Then, given this renewed focus on gun violence, do you expect or hope that there could be a different level of interest or approach to hearing the voices of young people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement? Cullors: I think so. I've been pretty impressed with the Parkland students who've listened to young black students and brown students, mostly poor students who've been saying, you know, ""our issues matter, too."" And many of the Parkland students who've gone to Chicago and then met up with the black youth, to talk about gun violence. Um, one of the young men, was quoted saying, our issues, as in white people's issues, are being amplified over black people's issues, it's just a matter of race, and I thought that was so powerful, because they're listening to the young black and brown students who are saying, you know, we deserve to be a part of this larger media conversation, part of this larger public dialog and outcry to save the lives of young black and brown people too. So that has been so impressive. And I point that out because it's important for us to name our victories and I think that narrative shift has happened because black people have said, ""hey, wait a second, like, let's be a little bit more complicated about how we're talking about this gun violence issue,"" and the Parkland students have heard it and have been amplifying. Lacey-Bordeaux: We, Contessa Gayles and I, read your book with great interest and it was cool to read about Richard Edmond Vargas, the main character in our documentary, in your book -- in that chapter, specifically, you describe how the Black Lives Matter movement was founded, by the acquittal of George Zimmerman. So I wanted to ask you about that framing. Why frame both Richard's story and your part in co-founding the movement in relationship to each other? What's that connection? Cullors: Richie is very important because he becomes one of the first young people that I mentor when I'm a young person. I was 21 when I met him, he was 14 years old. And he quickly becomes like a little brother to me. And when he's convicted it was devastating for all of us. I made a commitment to stay in his life, and staying a part of his life. George Zimmerman killed somebody, literally, I mean, Richie didn't hurt anybody, maybe scared a few people but he didn't physically harm anybody, and I am visiting him, in a jail cell, in a locked-up facility, far away from his family and his loved ones. And, then George Zimmerman killed a young person, a young black boy, gets to go home free, and it just shows this juxtaposition of the banality of a quote ""criminal justice system,"" that has not been run to prioritize black people's health and wellness, and it's sort of amplified in that moment. Lacey-Bordeaux: How involved have you been with any of his anti-patriarchy efforts? Cullors: Oh, it's been amazing. I mean, he knows all about patriarchy, doesn't he? (laughs) You know, I remember talking to him when he first got into county jail and he used to get in a lot of fights at the county jail. Not, not because he wanted to and I remember talking to him on the phone, he called me, and he's like, ""alright I'm about to get in a fight right now,"" and I said, ""OK, listen to me, you get to choose what kind of person you wanna be inside, you could still be an organizer, they didn't take that away from you, you get to organize on the inside,"" and he said, ""OK."" He ended up going to Susanville, 11 hours away, the guards were exceptionally violent, and he was just trying to survive in there. And we were talking about like what does it look like (to) organize inside. Richard's not someone who is quick to be quiet, because he's just like already having conversations about patriarchy and, you know, and, by the time it got so bad is when I think his greatest ideas took root. And, he set up this platform to amplify these conversations about patriarchy and its toxicity and its impact on men and boys, and I was just, it was brilliant, and he's brilliant, and, so impactful, and everything he touches turns to gold, you know, everything he explores and every conversation he has, he feels a sincerity, nothing is inauthentic about Richard Edmond. Lacey-Bordeaux: Somewhat in line with that, how do you see patriarchy as playing a role in Richard ending up in prison? Cullors: I think Richard has a lot of different choices to make and I think the peer pressure of patriarchy won. When he told me why he robbed, he was trying to pay rent and he, you know, he wasn't getting the hours he needed at the preschool. I asked him, ""why didn't you just ask me for money, like, you've lived- you've lived with me before, you've asked me for money, like why didn't you ask me for rent money?"" And he said ""I was ashamed. You know, I was told that like I need to be providing, that, you know, taking money from women ...,"" and so this idea of like who he had to be and what he had to do to get what he needed is chock-full of patriarchy. And that really shaped his decisions and his, you know, decision that was then landing him in prison for all these years. And, you know, I don't know, I think it's interesting, like, I'd love to ask him, like if he would change it, and if he would change what he did, um, I don't know what he would - you know I don't know what his life would be like, I'm not a person who's like ""go to prison and change!"" I'm actually not that person at all, but one thing he's been able to do on the inside for everybody else and for himself is remarkable. Granted we'll see what happens, you know, what life on the outside's gonna be like for him, he's incredibly resilient. He'll be fine, but, the impact of incarceration is a lifelong impact. Lacey-Bordeaux: What's the connection between patriarchy and violence? Cullors: We're seeing it now, like with mass shootings, exclusively by white men (Note: The vast majority of shootings are by men, but the interview was conducted before a shooting by a woman at YouTube headquarters), we're seeing it with the Boston Bomber, we see it with law enforcement, and the police that use violence as a form of control and power. Lacey-Bordeaux: What's the solution? Cullors: Organizing.

(AP) — Authorities arrested a suspect in a Thanksgiving shooting that spread panic at Alabama's largest shopping mall Thursday, but protesters said they would continue demonstrations over the police killing of another black man who was initially believed to be the shooter. Erron Martez Dequan Brown, 20, of Bessemer was captured in Georgia at a relative's home south of Atlanta, authorities said. He was jailed awaiting a hearing to be sent back to Alabama. The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Brown was charged in the shooting of Brian Xavier Wilson, 18, of Birmingham, who was wounded at the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover on Thanksgiving night. Authorities didn't announce charges in the shooting of another person who was wounded, 12-year-old girl, and a spokeswoman for the agency did not respond to an email seeking details. Protesters said Brown's arrest didn't resolve what they referred to as the ""murder"" of Emantic ""EJ"" Bradford Jr., 21, by police, and they vowed continuing demonstrations over his shooting death. ""We're asking members of the public to not spend another dime in Hoover until they take black lives seriously,"" Carlos Chaverst Jr., who has helped organize protests, said at a news conference. In a statement issued by their lawyer, Bradford's relatives said they were gratified by Brown's arrest and said it further underscored Bradford's ""unjust"" death. Police have said a Hoover police officer who was working security at the mall during the start of Black Friday shopping heard shots and responded within seconds. The officer, who has yet to be publicly identified, saw Bradford with a gun and shot him, police said. Authorities at first identified Bradford as the shooter who wounded two people. They later retracted that allegation and searched for the real gunman. Bradford's relatives have said he had a permit to carry a gun legally, and their attorney Ben Crump has quoted witnesses as saying Bradford was trying to help when he was gunned down. Story continues ""He was a good guy with a gun,"" Crump said. Court records show Brown previously was arrested in June 2017 in Huntsville on a charge of using a gun to rob a man, but the case was dismissed three months later after prosecutors filed notice that they didn't want to pursue the case. As Brown was being arrested near Atlanta, city leaders in Hoover were publicly asking the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, which is investigating the shootings, for permission to release more information about the shooting of Bradford. With its lone black City Council member, Derrick Murphy, acting as a spokesman, the city said it would look at releasing information on its own if no response came by noon Monday. Demonstrators and relatives of Bradford have pushed authorities to release video and other evidence about the shooting. Murphy, who joined other leaders in meeting with Bradford's relatives earlier this week, said the city wanted to help answer questions raised by the family. ""They have our love; they have our prayers,"" he said. Hoover is a city of 85,000 people that gained much of its population as white residents left Birmingham after the end of legalized racial segregation in neighboring Birmingham. Chaverst, one of the protest leaders, said the city was ""built on racism."" A statement from the state agency about Brown's arrest said it was ""highly likely"" that releasing evidence would hamper the continuing investigation, but it didn't directly address the city's request. The statement also did not say whether there was any relationship between Bradford and Brown, and a spokeswoman declined comment. The Bradford family lawyer, Crump, did not return a message about whether the two men knew each other. A minister who described himself as the Bradford family's pastor, Mike McClure Jr., said releasing video of the shooting would help calm growing tensions that have included days of protests and racist social media posts. ""When there is no information it only leads to imagination,"" said McClure, one of two pastors who closed the councilman's statement with prayer. McClure said Bradford attended his church, and McClure will officiate at funeral services on Saturday which will include a eulogy by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. ____ Brumback contributed from Atlanta.",April Pipkins Shooting of Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Benjamin Crump  Alabama Shopping Centre Shooting Police Police officer,"A man was shot in the head on the floor of the Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, Ala., on Thursday.","HOOVER, Ala.

Rick Scott signed a sweeping $400-million school safety bill on Friday, enacting significant gun control measures in the state for the first time since the GOP took control of the Legislature more than two decades ago. But the staunch Republican and longtime National Rifle Assn. member did not use his line-item veto authority to remove funding for what many consider the most contentious part of the legislation — a program that allows school employees to bring firearms on campus. Though Scott has repeatedly opposed the idea of arming teachers since 17 students and instructors were killed last month in a shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., he announced Friday after meeting with the victims’ families that he would approve the bill in its entirety. Standing in front of grieving families who had traveled to Tallahassee from Parkland, Scott thanked two of the parents, Ryan Petty and Andrew Pollack, for walking the Capitol halls and “fighting to get this bill across the finish line.” Advertisement Scott, who is considering a bid for U.S. Senate, commended Florida legislators for rushing the bill to his desk three weeks after the Feb. 14 shooting. “I want to point out that this is a far different way of operating from the typical inefficiency we see from the federal government in Washington,” he said. “Today should serve as an example to the entire country that government can and must move fast.” He also acknowledged Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School students. “You made your voices heard,” he said. “You didn’t let up and you fought until there was change. You helped change our state. You made a difference. You should be proud.” Advertisement Protesters rally against gun violence in Tallahassee, Fla., last month. (Mark Wallheiser / Associated Press ) The Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act raises the minimum age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21, imposes a three-day waiting period for most gun purchases and bans the sale or possession of “bump stocks,” which allow semiautomatic rifles to mimic machine guns. The NRA almost immediately filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of banning people under the age of 21 from buying firearms. Under Florida law, Scott could have used his line-item veto authority to reject the funding for a $67 million “guardian” program that would allow some teachers to volunteer to carry guns after undergoing 132 hours of firearms and 12 hours of diversity training. Advertisement Earlier this week, Florida senators tweaked the bill in an attempt to make it more appealing to Scott, altering the guardian program to exclude those who “exclusively perform classroom duties as classroom teachers.” The limitation does not apply to those who teach JROTC, current service members, or current or former law enforcement officers. Librarians, janitors and cafeteria workers would be eligible to carry guns, along with teachers who perform extracurricular roles, like coaching football or supervising the chess club. Scott admitted that he still opposed the guardian provision. “I still think law enforcement officers should be the ones who protect our schools,” he said before signing the bill. “I am glad, however, that the plan in this bill is not mandatory…. If counties do not want to do this, they simply can say no.” Advertisement Scott added that he had talked to legislators about re-diverting funds that were not used for the guardian program to employ more law enforcement officers. If he vetoed the program’s funding, he said, that would not be possible. Though the bill has faced stiff opposition from the NRA, it also fell short of the gun control measures many students, parents and teachers had advocated. On Wednesday, a majority of House Democrats voted against the GOP-sponsored bill on the basis that would allow some teachers and staffers to carry guns on campus and did not go far enough in restricting access to assault rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines. The Florida Education Assn. urged Scott on Thursday to jettison funding for arming teachers. Advertisement In a letter to Scott, the teachers union president said that the guardian program would enable more than 200,000 school employees to carry firearms on campus. “We urge you to honor your instincts and act to keep additional firearms from our schools unless they are in the hands of trained law enforcement personnel,” Joanne McCall, president of the teachers union, wrote to the governor. “Our teachers and other school employees are ready to fiercely defend our students but none of them should ever have to choose between shepherding students to safety or confronting an armed assailant where they are sure to draw fire towards the very students they are trying to protect,” she added. As the bill moved through the Legislature, the NRA, sent out a flurry of “emergency alerts” to its supporters. Accusing Republican leaders who supported the bill of “bullying and coercion,” it urged supporters to call elected officials to demand they block the legislation. Advertisement “YOU and every other law-abiding gun owner is being blamed for an atrocious act of premeditated murder,” Marion Hammer, an NRA and Unified Sportsmen of Florida lobbyist, wrote in an alert Tuesday. “Neither the 3-day waiting period on all rifles and shotguns, raising the age from 18 to 21 to buy any firearm, or the bump stock ban will have any effect on crime. Despite that fact, Senate leaders rammed through gun control as part of the bill.” The NRA’s lawsuit seeks an injunction to stop Florida from enforcing its new gun restrictions. “This blanket ban violates the fundamental rights of thousands of responsible, law-abiding Florida citizens and is thus invalid under the Second and Fourteenth Amendments,” the suit says. For all the disagreement, some portions of the bill were uncontroversial. Advertisement Legislators on both sides of the aisle seemed in broad agreement on additional funding for mental health services, giving law enforcement officials more power to temporarily seize weapons and ammunition from people with mental health issues, and allocating $25 million to destroy and rebuild Marjory Stoneman Douglas’ three-story freshman building. “The bottom line is Floridians were not going to take no action at all,” said Susan MacManus, professor of political science at the University of South Florida. “Something had to be done…. Everywhere, people just said, ‘They better do something or I’m not going to vote Republican.’” With narrow votes in the last two presidential and gubernatorial elections, MacManus said Republicans felt they needed to bow to public opinion on gun control. Last week, a Quinnipiac University poll showed that 62% of Florida voters supported a nationwide ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that fire more than 10 rounds. About 56% oppose allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns on school grounds. Advertisement “Yes, it was a calculation in a way,” MacManus said of Scott’s decision to sign the bill. “But the bottom line is when he has the support of the 17 families, who pleaded, ‘Just do something,’ there really wasn’t a choice.” Jarvie is a special correspondent UPDATES: 4:45 p.m.: The article was updated with news of the NRA lawsuit.

""We want to continue in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,"" Anne Finucane, vice chairman of Bank of America (BAC), said in an interview. ""It is our intention not to finance these military-style firearms for civilian use."" Finucane said the bank does ""have a few manufacturers of military-style firearms."" ""We're in discussion with them. We have let them know that it's not our intent to underwrite or finance military-style firearms on a go-forward basis,"" she said. Finucane was referring to the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles produced by gun companies like Remington Outdoor Company. Remington made the Bushmaster used in a 2012 mass shooting that killed 26 children and educators at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. Bank of America is listed as a creditor in Remington's Chapter 11 filing. A spokesman for Bank of America would not confirm or deny reports to CNNMoney that the bank also lends to Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Vista Outdoor (VSTO), which also make AR-15-style rifles. Remington, Ruger and Vista did not return messages from CNNMoney. Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group, applauded the move. ""When the second-largest bank in the US takes concrete steps to prevent gun violence, it sends a clear message to the entire industry: It's time for every financial institution to do their part,"" said Everytown president John Feinblatt, in a statement. But the gun industry group, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, objected to Bank of America's characterization of the guns as ""military"" since they're products for civilians. ""We as an industry would welcome the opportunity to sit down with Bank of America executives to explain our industry's perspective and to discuss what really would work to keep firearms out of the hands of those who should not have them,"" said NSSF spokesman Michael Bazinet, in a statement. Related: Why the AR-15 is the mass shooter's go-to weapon In February, Bank of America said it plans to ""engage the limited number of clients we have that manufacture assault weapons for non-military use to understand what they can contribute to this shared responsibility."" This is a rising trend on Wall Street, which is losing its taste for gun manufacturers ever since a mass shooting in February, when a AR-15-style Smith & Wesson rifle made by American Outdoor Brands was used to kill 17 students and educators at a high school in Parkland, Florida. Last month, Citigroup (C)said it will bar companies that it does business with from selling guns to people under the age of 21 and require customers to undergo background checks for all firearm purchases. Money manger BlackRock, (BLK) the largest shareholder in both Sturm Ruger and American Outdoor Brands, said last month that it will start offering clients the option to invest in funds that exclude firearms and retailers that sell them. State Street (STT), a top shareholder in Sturm Ruger, American Outdoor Brands and Vista Outdoor, has said that it's contacted the companies to see how they ""will support the safe and responsible use of their products."" Blackstone, another investment firm, reached out to a dozen hedge fund managers asking for information about their stakes in gun manufacturers and distributors. Related: Remington, one of the oldest gun makers in America, files Chapter 11 Bank of America's Finucane stopped short of saying the bank was going to stop lending to gun retailers any time soon, saying that ""gets into civil liberties and Second Amendment."" Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) Chief Executive Officer Edward Stack said in February, days after the Parkland shooting, that his stores would stop selling ""assault-type rifles"" and high capacity magazines, and won't sell any gun to anyone under 21. Walmart (WMT), which stopped selling military-style semiautomatic rifles in 2015, also recently raised its gun buying age to 21, along with L.L.

A federal court judge blocked Texan Cody Wilson's website on Tuesday by issuing a temporary injunction. Eight states had sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone -- from a teen to a ""lone wolf"" gunman -- to make untraceable, undetectable plastic weapons. Wilson complied with the judge's order and shut down his Defcad website, which he wanted to turn into the ""WikiLeaks of guns."" But by then, the blueprints he had posted -- after President Donald Trump's administration granted him permission to publish in a settlement to end a five-year legal battle -- had been downloaded thousands of times. ""No matter how badly I win or lose, you can download a gun from the internet,"" Wilson told AFP at the headquarters of Defense Distributed, the company he runs out of a modest factory in Texas capital Austin. ""This attempt by these authorities to go into court and stifle this information drove more people to the website to download it and spread it deeper into the internet."" Sporting a pair of gray jeans and a dark blue t-shirt, the 30-year-old with a close-cropped beard wouldn't appear out of place as a tech executive in Silicon Valley. The ideology he says he is driven by is a defense of the US constitution's first and second amendments -- the rights to free speech and to bear arms. Wilson believes the intense media attention he generated cemented one of his principal goals: to use technology and the spread of gun-making information as a permanent bulwark against any future attempts at gun control in the US. ""We believe that the firearm itself, this implement of violence, is an essential component of force, of sovereignty,"" he says. He concedes that what he has done, and still wants to do, ""offends the conscience"" of some people, but he says ""it's never been illegal in this country to make a firearm -- and the way that you make it shouldn't affect that law."" Story continues - Anarchist philosophy - Wilson subscribes to an anarchist philosophy that the free exchange of ideas on the internet -- in its absolute form -- is a check on government. ""It's a politics that predicted WikiLeaks, predicted Bitcoin, predicted anonymous mail and anonymous communications online,"" he says. The law school dropout has dedicated the last five years of his life to the cause of unfettered online access to gun-making information. ""I'm a publisher. At the end of the day, I do many things, but the main thing that I strive to do is to take my information and put it on the internet,"" he says. Defense Distributed, the company Wilson co-founded in 2013 and currently heads, is more than a publishing firm -- it sells actual firearms products. It has created a machine called the ""Ghost Gunner,"" priced at $2,000. Computer code operates the machine, which carves essential components of various firearms to create weapons without serial numbers. - 'Ghost guns' - Such weapons -- called ""ghost guns"" -- are already being made by those who can properly carve metal components. The ""Ghost Gunner"" takes away the need for advanced skill and creates untraceable weapons. The issue is far from academic. The Los Angeles Police Department last month showcased a trove of ""ghost"" weapons it recovered from gang members. Law enforcement cannot trace these weapons if they are used to commit crimes. That is why lawmakers, law enforcement personnel, gun control groups and even Trump himself expressed everything from panic to skepticism this week when Wilson started distributing blueprints online. Those blueprints included his company's own creation, the ""Liberator"" plastic gun -- a sidearm that resembles something seen on science fiction TV shows. The potential impact of Wilson's publication was worldwide. Any country with uncensored access to the internet could see its gun control measures circumvented with a click of a mouse. ""It is immediately obvious to anyone who looks at this issue that 3D-printed guns are nothing short of a menace to society,"" said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. ""We will continue to do everything in our power to make sure that this temporary halt in publication becomes a permanent one,"" Gardiner said after the injunction. Wilson also plans to fight, just as he unsuccessfully fought in the courts for five years. The judge that ordered his website shut plans to hold a hearing on the states' lawsuit next week. Wilson put out a call for donations to fund the legal challenge, but is aware that he may be facing a losing battle. ""I believe that duty demands that I continue to fight it,"" he said, while admitting that ""I think I'll waste a lot of money.""",Cody Wilson Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms Austin Liberator 3D printing Firearm Gun Printing Sexual assault,"Cody Wilson, the founder of Defense Distortion, at the company’s headquarters in Austin, Tex.","Austin (AFP) - The US ""crypto-anarchist"" who caused panic this week by publishing online blueprints for 3D-printed firearms said Wednesday that whatever the outcome of a legal battle, he has already succeeded in his political goal of spreading the designs far and wide.

Nikolas Cruz, 19, was detained without resistance shortly after the February 14 attack in Parkland, north of Miami, and was questioned in the Broward County Sheriff's Office. According to the transcript of the interrogation, detective John Curcio offered him a glass of water. ""I do not deserve it,"" Cruz remarked. When the officer briefly left the room to look for water anyway, Cruz said to himself: ""Kill me, just kill me."" Then he told the detective that demons in his head -- which had started tormenting him years earlier -- told him to ""buy weapons, kill animals and destroy everything."" ""What are the demons?"" the detective asked. ""The voices,"" Cruz said. ""The evil side"". ""What does your voice say to you?"" Curcio asked. ""Burn. Kill. Destroy,"" he replied. Cruz said he had attempted suicide two months before the attack -- after his mother's death in November 2017 -- with an overdose of the painkiller Ibuprofen. Two years before that episode, he tried and failed to commit suicide by alcohol poisoning. Cruz said that he was depressed by his lack of friends and his loneliness. When the detective asked him why he had decided to buy a semiautomatic rifle -- an AR-15 -- the one he allegedly used in the massacre, he replied: ""Because it looks 'cool.'"" Cruz bought the rifle legally.

The principal also said that he felt the video was necessary training in the event of an active shooter incident at the school. “However, the goal was to hopefully get everyone in the mindset that situations like Columbine and other school shootings are prevalent and relevant in our society today and that the safety of all should be the number one goal for all of us,” said Jones. REUTERS The Columbine shooting took place at a Colorado high school in 1999. Two shooters there killed 13 people in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history and one of the most high-profile in recent history. There have since been several other large school shootings. In 2007, a shooting at Virginia Tech left 32 people dead, and a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, killed 26 people, many of them small children. The training in Maryland comes in the wake of a shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, last month, where 17 students and faculty were killed. Schools across the country are grappling with what to do in the event of an attack and how to prevent it. On Sunday, the White House announced a school safety plan that included arming teachers. No major national gun legislation has been passed since the massacre at Sandy Hook, but there have been dozen efforts to curb gun violence at the state level.​""",Columbine High School Columbine High School massacre Stoneman Douglas High School shooting School shooting Eric Harris e Dylan Klebold Mass shooting Massacre Shooting Mass murder Murder,"A photograph of the mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in 1999.","""The lockdown presentation happened Friday at Laurel High School, about 20 miles outside of Washington, D.C. “Some people were upset.

American gun manufacturers produce millions of firearms annually — nearly 9.4 million in 2015, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Nearly 3.7 million of those were rifles, including AR-15-style semiautomatic rifles like those used in several mass shootings. Only a few of the thousands of licensed firearms manufacturers in the country are publicly owned and must disclose sales figures to investors. Those include American Outdoor Brands Corporation, formerly known as Smith & Wesson Holding Corporation, which has reported declines in firearms sales for the past four quarters but generally does not report specific volumes. On Thursday, the company said that revenue from its firearms segment for the third quarter slumped 40.6 percent from last year to $117.6 million, compared with a 13.4 percent upswing in its outdoor products division. Sturm Ruger, another public company, cut its production levels by 24 percent last year and also laid off 28 percent of its employees, according to Wedbush analysts. Other investor-owned businesses include Vista Outdoor and Olin, which both make ammunition. A slew of smaller, single-product manufacturers emerged during the Obama administration, experts said. Most make semiautomatic firearms like the AR-15 known by some as assault weapons and by others as modern sport rifles. Few, if any, are eager to share performance metrics with the public. Data diminishes at each step. And few gun dealers publicly disclose how many guns they sell. The N.R.A. did not respond to requests for information about sales. Analysts estimate that fewer than a quarter of firearms sales to consumers come from big-box retailers like Walmart and the outdoor and hunting outfitter Cabela’s. At Dick’s Sporting Goods, revenue from hunting products, including rifles, constitute 10 percent or less of annual sales, according to another Wedbush report. Although Dick’s stores can be found nationwide, it sold assault-style rifles only at its 35 Field & Stream stores and on its websites. Walmart, which had already instituted similar restrictions in 2015, sells firearms at about half of its nearly 4,000 supercenter locations nationwide.",Gun Firearm Weapon  United States Gun shows in the United States Shooting Gun control Bazaar Gun shop,A gun show in Las Vegas in 2015.

298,298,10540,https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/28/politics/trump-senators-afraid-nra/index.html,Trump tells senators 'You're afraid of the NRA',"(CNN) President Donald Trump asked Sen. Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican who's worked on a bill to strengthen background checks for gun purchases, whether he left a proposal to raise the gun purchasing age to 21 out of his measure because senators are ""afraid of the NRA."" In an exchange during a meeting of a bipartisan group of senators at the White House, Trump asked Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Toomey if their background check bill they authored in the aftermath of a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012 included a provision that would have raised the age at which individuals could purchase rifles from 18 to 21. Toomey said it did not. ""You know why? Because you're afraid of the NRA,"" Trump said. The Manchin-Toomey bill is different from the more limited ""Fix NICS"" bill , from Sens. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and the second ranking GOP member in the chamber, and Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, which offers financial incentives for state and local governments to report information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Trump reiterated multiple times Wednesday that he wanted to see a ""comprehensive"" approach on guns. The comments undercut Republican congressional leaders who have argued that the key on any legislation was starting with a bill that had broader bipartisan support like the narrow Fix NICs bill. Throughout the meeting, Trump encouraged members to present their ideas. Sometimes after an idea was presented Trump would look at colleagues and ask if it could be added to the base bill. He called for ""one, great piece of legislation."" Toomey said after the meeting that he didn't think Trump's comments were aimed at him personally. ""I think he was referring to members of Congress generally,"" Toomey said. Toomey said that he hasn't received any money from the NRA since 2010. ""If there's a Republican who has demonstrated he's not afraid of the NRA, that would be me,"" he said. Trump's comments on the NRA are notable because Toomey's expanded background check bill from 2013 was opposed by the National Rifle Association. In a statement in April 2013, the NRA said the Manchin-Toomey bill, which would have expanded background checks at gun shows and over internet sale s, would ""not prevent the next shooting"" and would ""not solve violent crime."" ""While the overwhelming rejection of President Obama and Mayor Bloomberg's ""universal"" background check agenda is a positive development, we have a broken mental health system that is not going to be fixed with more background checks at gun shows. The sad truth is that no background check would have prevented the tragedies in Newtown, Aurora or Tucson,"" the NRA's statement said. ""We need a serious and meaningful solution that addresses crime in cities like Chicago, addresses mental health deficiencies, while at the same time protecting the rights of those of us who are not a danger to anyone."" A spokesman for Toomey said that the senator has demonstrated that he's not afraid of the gun lobby. ""Despite the aggressive opposition of the NRA, Senator Toomey never wavered in his commitment to this legislation,"" Toomey press secretary Steve Kelly said in a statement. ""The NRA downgraded Senator Toomey's rating and refused to back him for re-election."" At Wednesday's meeting, Trump argued that it should be ""so easy"" to get 60 Senate votes on common-sense reforms -- though it's unclear exactly which ones. Murphy sought to give him a reality check: ""I think you underestimate the power of the gun lobby."" Trump retorted that while ""they have great power over you people, they have less power over me."" Trump argued that the NRA is ""well-meaning"" and said he believes ""they're there"" as far as supporting more reforms -- a view that has not been backed up by any of the NRA's public statements in the wake of the Parkland shooting. ""Some of you people are petrified of the NRA. You can't be petrified. You can't be petrified,"" Trump said. ""While today's meeting made for great TV, the gun-control proposals discussed would make for bad policy that would not keep our children safe,"" NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said in a statement. ""Instead of punishing law-abiding gun owners for the acts of a deranged lunatic, our leaders should pass meaningful reforms that would actually prevent future tragedies."" Lawmakers should focus on ""fixing the broken mental health system, strengthening background checks to ensure the records of people who are prohibited from possessing firearms are in the (National Instant Criminal Background Check) system, securing our schools and preventing the dangerously mentally ill from accessing firearms,"" Baker added.",Pat Toomey Republican Party CNN United States Senate News Pennsylvania Image  Photograph Photography,Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania,"(CNN) President Donald Trump asked Sen.

Researchers called it the first nationally representative study on ER visits for gun injuries among U.S. kids. They found that more than one-third of the wounded children were hospitalized and 6 percent died. Injuries declined during most of the 2006-14 study, but there was an upswing in the final year. The researchers found that 11 of every 100,000 children and teens treated in U.S. emergency rooms have gun-related injuries. That amounts to about 8,300 kids each year. The scope of the problem is broader though; the study doesn't include kids killed or injured by gunshots who never made it to the hospital, nor does it count costs for gunshot patients after they're sent home. """"I don't know what more we need to see in the world to be able to come together and tackle this problem,"""" said Dr. Faiz Gani, the lead author and a researcher at Johns Hopkins University medical school. The study is an analysis of estimates on emergency department visits in a national database created by the U.S. government's Agency on Healthcare Research and Quality. The researchers focused on victims under age 18; the average age was about 15. Almost half the gun injuries were from assaults, nearly 40 percent were unintentional and 2 percent were suicides. There were five times more ER visits for boys than for girls. Pediatric ER visits for gun injuries fell from a rate of 15 per 100,000 in 2006 to about 7 per 100,000 in 2013, then jumped to 10 per 100,000 in 2014, the most recent data. University funding paid for the analysis, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics. The findings highlight that gun violence involving kids extends beyond mass shootings that gain the most attention, said Dr. Robert Sege, co-author of an American Academy of Pediatrics gun injuries policy. """"It's extraordinarily sad because these children grow up in fear and it affects their ability to feel safe and comfortable at home or in school. It has an enormous ripple effect on child development,"""" said Sege, a Tufts University professor of medicine who was not involved in the research. Pressure from the gun lobby has limited U.S. government funding for research on gun injuries and death, and that has led to big gaps in understanding the scope of the problem, said Dr. Denise Dowd, an ER physician at Children's Mercy hospital in Kansas City. """"It's really important that we have an idea of the magnitude of life lost and injured and how much money we are spending... so we can prioritize it as a national health concern.""""

It just happened in the last day and a half.” But Trump, Rubio and McConnell are dead wrong: Not forcing these conversations is, quite literally, a fatal mistake. ADVERTISEMENT Discussing gun violence has become so poisonous and polarizing that it exerts a strong impact on our everyday lives and personal relationships. Some Americans who have firearms safely stored in their home, won’t bring this topic up lest others think they are Second Amendment zealots with a basement bunker stocked for a coming ammo-pocalypse. Others don’t mention the “G-word” lest they be accused of being a “libtard.” This isn’t healthy — not confronting the reality that kids get shot when they play with unsecured firearms makes such accidents sure to happen. In more public contexts, our historical reluctance to force these conversations has made it more difficult to start them in the first place. It’s hard to have educated and informed exchanges thanks to the Dickey Amendment, a provision inserted into a 1996 federal spending bill mandating that no funds allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) can be used to “advocate or promote gun control” — enacting a de facto ban on gun violence research — resources the lack of which we literally “die for.” Our unwillingness to talk about guns and gun violence has even made it easy for states to make such discourse downright unlawful. Indiana state law, for example, bars public and private employers from asking employees about whether they own, use, or transport a gun, with no public safety exception. If they do, they can be slapped with a civil suit for economic damages, court costs, and even punitive damages. While this law might make gun owners more comfortable, it puts others at risk by preventing employers from adequately protecting other employees from at-risk colleagues. If Bob in marketing is suicidal, or threatens Mary down in sales, then Bob’s boss is in a really tough position, and might hesitate to ask Bob whether he has a firearm readily at hand in his car trunk in the parking lot. And that hesitation might be fatal. Such restrictions are particularly mystifying when the law affirmatively protects the right to discuss gun ownership, access, and safety — even though such conversations can be discomfiting. In Wollschlauger v. Governor of Florida, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit declared unconstitutional a Florida law that ostensibly protected “patient privacy” by prohibiting physicians from asking patients about their ownership and use of firearms. That law, the court held, violated physicians’ First Amendment rights, interfering with professional standards that require them to ask and educate about firearm ownership. Patients who were uncomfortable with such questions could refuse to answer — and such topics were certainly not the only difficult discussions to emerge in doctor-patient conversations. Our growing reluctance to talk about firearms and firearm violence doesn’t respect the Second Amendment; it turns it into a club used to bully others into silence and submission. This is the opposite of what the Second Amendment is intended to be — the constitutional provision that, as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia put it in District of Columbia v. Heller, has “protected the rights of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.” Using the Second Amendment as a silencer bastardizes it, undermining the civil discourse essential to democracy, creating and reinforcing a flawed narrative that fundamentally changes what people think gun ownership is about and warps popular understandings of the Second Amendment. That’s how we come to believe that “shall not infringe” means literally that no firearms regulations are permissible, equate gun safety education to gun-grabbing schemes, and misconstrue even pro-Second Amendment Supreme Court cases as unconstitutional judicial activism — all dangerous misconceptions that perpetuate and strengthen the politicization of Second Amendment issues and mass shootings. The first step in preventing gun violence — from domestic assaults with firearms to school shootings like Newtown and Parkland with high body counts — is to talk about them in meaningful ways that go beyond thoughts and prayers and Facebook posts to engagement and research. Without these resources, Second Amendment advocates and opponents won’t find common ground, and the majority of us who are caught in the middle can’t learn from these exchanges. These conversations might get messy, uncomfortable, emotional and downright infuriating, but have them we must. As the Eleventh Circuit emphasized in Wollschlaeger, “[m]any are those who must endure speech they do not like, but that is a necessary cost of freedom.” Jody L.

Jeffrey Clark was “DC Bowl Gang” on the site, court files said, and Edward Clark went by “DC_Stormer.” Court papers assert that after his brother’s death, Jeffrey Clark posted on Gab a photo of the brothers wearing masks and holding a shotgun and a rifle, in front of a flag with a skull and cross bones. The documents said Jeffrey Clark posted a description of himself as a “Meth-Smoking, Pipe bomb making, mailman-murding . . .

Jeffrey Clark said, according to the court document, “They had not broken any laws, but at some point if a line gets crossed, I would be violent, everyone has a line . . .” Authorities said in the court documents that the brothers “fantasized about killing ‘Jews and blacks’ ” and that family members feared Jeffrey Clark might harm himself or others. AD The documents said the brothers had four guns between them, registered in the District — a Remington Arms handgun, a Mossberg shotgun, a Beretta handgun and a Ruger Mini-14 rifle. The Beretta was recovered at the site of the suicide, the court files said. Court documents said agents seized the other weapons from a relative’s home outside the District. AD The documents said Jeffrey Clark surrendered another weapon to agents, a Colt .38 handgun, that was not registered to either brother. The FBI said in court filings that agents also confiscated two kits to convert semiautomatic AR-15s into fully automatic rifles. Authorities said they found two muzzleloading pistols, in Jeffrey Clark’s bedroom and in the basement of the house. In Edward Clark’s room, the court documents said, they found two ballistic vests, two ballistic helmets and two gas masks.

(Photo: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg/Getty Images) By now, you’ve probably heard the news about the horrific mass shooting at a gaming tournament held at a popular shopping and entertainment area in Jacksonville, Fla., on Sunday. Jacksonville Sheriff Mike Williams said the gunman killed two people and shot nine others before turning the gun on himself. The shooting occurred during an esports tournament in which gamers competed by playing “Madden NFL 2019,” a competitive football video game. Judging from video from the incident, the players were broadcasting their performances on Twitch, a live-streaming platform, when the gunshots began. Esports, meaning the presentation of competitive video games before an audience in the manner of traditional sports, is still an unfamiliar concept to many. Wait….that was for a video game event? Not an actual game? Like home video games!? Wtf man — Glasper’s Beef Patty Chef (@questlove) August 26, 2018 The tournament was being held at the GLHF Game Bar, which is described on its website as a home for nerds and gamers, next to a Chicago Pizza. The Jacksonville Landing, which is located along the St. Johns River, is home to restaurants, stores, and live entertainment. The GLHF Game Bar is designed as a place for people to relax, drink, eat, and play video games together. “Whether it be PC, console, or arcade cabinet, we’ve got it here at GLHF,” the website reads. The bar, and many other locations across the U.S., host gaming tournaments regularly. Players sign up, pay a fee that varies usually based on how big the event is, and compete against each other, usually for a cash prize.

The ordinance was approved after an AP story investigating the reselling of confiscated guns. That report concluded that many of the guns sold by the police were used for new crimes. The ordinance to prohibit the sales passed 6-1 Monday. Instead of selling guns that are confiscated, police will have to dispose of them. “Disposing of long guns and assault rifles is a sensible approach,” Councilwoman Candace Mumm told the AP. “Instead of spending time recycling weapons, our police staff can get back to the primary mission of solving crimes and protecting the public.” ADVERTISEMENT Spokane is the second city to ban law enforcement arms sales after the AP's report, following King County in Washington, which passed a similar ordinance on Oct. 2. Between 2011 and 2018, the forfeited firearms sales generated $16,787 for Spokane, according to the ordinance. Those sales ranged from $633 to about $7,488 in any given year. “We may actually be costing the city coffers by reselling and recycling the guns,"" Mumm explained to AP. The text of the ordinance reads as follows: “The City of Spokane intends to do all it can to prevent and reduce violent crime in Spokane and has determined that destroying all seized or forfeited firearms rather than reselling them to the public or to gun dealers is a simple, sensible and effective way to reduce access to firearms and help reduce and prevent gun violence.”",Firearm Gun control Gun National Instant Criminal Background Check System Handgun Gun shop Background check Universal background check Rifle Concealed carry,"A gun used by the police in Spokane, Wash., in 2012.","The city of Spokane passed a city ordinance on Tuesday banning police from selling confiscated guns, according to The Associated Press.
